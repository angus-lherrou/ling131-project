their credibility\nI I think that's what Nick was a disaster for the Democrats because she was a it was ... it was it was obviously incredibly destructive and just and disgusting but\nIt was

G. wells and uh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even does the was a member of this plus ultra group and I thought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real well\nYes and no okay 'cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus altered but it's something else even does be was a part of southern golf club thirty three that he created it was just a special club for some of the people he knew and some very special people and of course a lot of people who believe that the ... thirty three comes from the thirty three degrees masonry\nBecause this was part of the Malay when he was a kid so plus ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea that maybe plus altered may be some time travel group for some group that created a a breakaway civilization on some other plane a utopian plane well H. G. wells are as you know\nThere was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another picture movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fabled time machine\nAnd the movie and it's kind of ... cryptic late says H. G. wells married Amy Catherine Robbins\nWho died in Nineteen twenty seven and then it says as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel\nAnd women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order now he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works and he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a utopia that basically emanates from a global is government there was a ... that led them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nOr the world would be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who for defies the war machine and so that actually approximate what really happened in World War two\nWell then he runs several of his books that\nThat there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing and kind of like what Ben joined Israeli said about the British Government and well well you know he was a visionary we notice\nAnd whether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you ... ... ... but he according to this movie was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also one of the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine\nBut he was be I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells at the time well by the time of his death he had patented ... about seven hundred things but\nAfter he died in Nineteen forty three\nAll of his possessions were seized by a government office called the government offices of alien property and about three weeks after they were seized all Tesla's things in documents were given a thorough examination by group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who was the uncle of Donald Trump our president well what's interesting is that\nYou know Jon Jeter Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but\nA Trump went on to ah actually\nCreate X ray machines Tesla was working extra machines inside but he created them and of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from a long line of intellectuals and very ah geniuses like my uncle John J. Trump John ... Trump he was a genius as well well\nUm what's interesting about all this is is that\nThe question is what did Donald Trump Sancho finding those papers in Nineteen forty three\nWell there's a question as to whether or not Tesla had a time machine and that there was something about\nThat the era of wells the era of Tesla and ah this this writer who the science fiction writer his name was Ingersoll lock would unlock wood was the author of of a few books\nOne that raised many eyebrows a couple Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and another was called Nineteen hundred and then there was the last president\nWell both of the books are in the library of Congress and you can read them but Newsweek did this strange article and twenty Seventeen basically saying that\nThis barren Trump character in this book goes to Russia he gets advised by a character named Don\nAnd then he goes to the Fifth Avenue hotel in New York and then uh this Fifth Avenue a hotel or whatever it was it was I think probably the Waldorf Astoria if I'm right basically had some significance as well\nBecause there there were there was that book by luck would called\nAh the last president in in the last president\nThere's a quote from the book is really interesting it's about a state of uproar in New York after the election of an outsider candidate said that the entire east side this is from the book this is in the Eighteen hundreds by the way uh it said the entire east side is it a state of uproar police officer shot it through the streets warning city folk to stay indoors for the night\nMoms have vast size or organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists and threatened to ponder into spoil the houses of the rich who have wrong at a press them for so many years the Fifth Avenue hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob the novel continues\nSigning it address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands by the way Trump Tower\nIs on seven twenty five\nGift avenue in New York\nThis all sounds uncannily weird and of course it sounds like fiction\nBut I Want you to think about plus alter I'm going to take a break and when you think about ... plus altered 'cause I'm going to tell you what I told everybody in the second hour about how plus ultra\nHas a connection to our president Donald Trump and it's really peculiar and then I'm going to give you one final\nProof that something bizarre is going on\nIn his face time continuum with regard to our president\nPretty bizarre AAA take seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'll be back with more right here on ground zero\n\n[laughter] I'm On bunks for closing on how they even some confidence from science for home equity loan only give them what\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer\nI Know about tidal froth sorry register with home title walk and discovered some states had already taken over title thank God I found out on time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you host title lock will for pennies today hold tight along puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up this at home title lock dot com\nHome title luck dot com\nYou considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it saves\nHe predicted programming\nWe don't know for sure but we can get your calls coming up trouble he picks up at three thirty seven hundred that's triple eats except for three thirty seven hundred will be back\nWith mine\nAnd the mind [noise]\n\n\n\n\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan that is right for\nCall today and we'll start\n[noise]\nI'm quite Lewis and you're listening to the best to ground zero please hold all the calls is pre recorded\nShow\nIt's in the Bush kept me from that so and I'm\nNot I'm not around the lead singer everything got it I mean not some\nBut the whole thing [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] oh gee we use weights\n[noise]\nHadn't power [noise]\nThat ... days or like rubber\nYou\nWant to have you with [laughter]\n[noise] I'm\nQuite Louis [noise] you're listening to ground zero [noise] them back in time if someone could time travel what would you want it to be [noise]\nGood to be that our president is it time travel it could be that maybe his association with his family were the reasons behind old science fiction books to talk about buried and Trump [noise]\nGood to be that maybe there's a relationship with ...

whole liberty they trace each Wyman wrote about this too [laughter] and the funny thing about Tracy climate that she was one of my producers at one time\nBut I used to always love her writing and so I get a get a feeling sometimes we all figure that they're going to same together we think of the same things together for some reason I mean that's a that's why I'm\nA ... that's why you know it's it's it's amazing that she was ready by ... all the stuff's been taking down that's what's really weird\nIs it all of her material has been taken down about this subject\nAnd what does that tell us don't know\nBut I haven't been able to get a hold of her that's what's really scary but from what I understand all this stuff about the the the uh this program I'm Talking about 'cause\nI got my research just looking around uh the Internet finding the connections\nThat like the plot soldier thing is something that I also ah didn't realize until I I read about plus ultra beat being uh uh what was written on the pillars are at your browser it was Hercules had it inscribed on these pillars Gibraltar basically would be\nA where the end of the world was in the new world was to be unknown I knew that it's so writing it altogether and figuring it out but then I wanted to see if anyone else to do about plus ultra and sure enough Tracy chime in had been writing about plus ultra\nBut then all of her stuff was removed from the Internet and people are saying what happened to the plus ultra stories on the Internet so\nWhen I when I hear stories like that I immediately think\nThose that are being persecuted in a social media and their websites and what have you done for a reason you know um they're trying to block some information I I just ... and I've always told you that I'm not one that believes I'm like George no data and all the leading coincidences or you know\nAnd especially in this case when you have so much I'm a synchronous cities there that I mean that that just blows me away about the ah John G A Trump die from the\nOther thing is I was there was a Newsweek article about it on in twenty Seventeen that's were I mean I read about it a long time ago even before you know Trump was president I read about the John Gee the Trump connection to Nikola Tesla and somebody had said well why don't you do a show about you know Donald Trump being a time traveler\nWell I didn't want to just do that you know during the election because I was thinking to myself no so I held on to for a long time but then when I saw this plus ultra thing on this tomorrow and movie I saw the other night\nI saw that I talked about this movie a long time ago but I didn't make the connection to mar a Lago and then it came back to me oh my God there was an article about Donald Trump's relationship with John Trump and his uncle who had a relationship with the attack\nBut in a way where he took his papers [noise] and then I was reminded the Baron from story I mean a lot of people who are barely read I read about on the discovery or it's a bit when I saw the mar a Lago thing I just went this is too much it's just too much of a coincidence that this is happening\nAnd Donald Trump might have had a pest fascination with all this but I Can't believe that he conceived of putting in those areas looking tiles that it it don't even have the same exact writing a letter for letter as a

probably put someone that split and then his Longate it and that's why it's only a quarter of an inch deep in soccer\nThree talented people put on the fringe investigations broadcast the first is the cryptic guy Christian McLeod Christian how how long have you ah folks have been doing this\nWell George we've been doing the podcasts for about three months I'm battalion I've been together working as a team and equip did a feel for about three years and I've been doing it for about twenty to myself\nIt sounds like you you folks are all having a great time doing this\nWe have a blast it it's like working with your best friends\nNow for people who want to listen to what you do how do they find you ...\nYou can find this on fringe investigations on YouTube or fringe investigation that that I'm\nNot the second part gas there who works with the ... the guy Christian McLeod is tiny Daniel hers Daniel tell me a little bit about the podcast\nOr the cast is it's meant to talk about a little bit of everything um we want to bring truth we want to bring fallen and just everything we can to the airways\nWell and you you're all doing a great job doing that and podcasting as just growing now isn't it\nIt is it it's a huge thing there's an amazing amount of gas out there and so many good ones as well\nWhen a when you're doing your pod casting and a lotta times you go out on paranormal probes and investigating what he has been for you the scariest thing you've ... you've uncovered\n[noise] well uh we\nWere in an area with what we found a a stride between two foot or it's a Christian correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't at Twenty one inches\nUp we lost we lost one of the ... that's okay but there are certain ... ... is slim marina welcome your other two are still out there on the radio waves Marino\nThank you yeah you know what I'm that they can have time to bring let them better than alternative things and kind of Nick thing which is what makes fringe investigation south I'm now\nI'm thrown in the wild card there and and like I said we take our research\nVery seriously but we did not take our stuff\nIs there a ... an episode that you had that ah you wouldn't want to repeat because it scared the living daylights outta view\nWe had a couple of times in the field um where we were just short of running out of the woods and we got a couple of picture and you know they never turned out as clean as they want\nYou know you only get prepared in that moment that you're going to be ready you have everything you know you have the experience you have the equipment and yet when it comes down to that moment that's the real fears that then\nAnd one more time slim hotter people listen to your podcast\nAnd they can go now that that that that investigation dot com or they can find a streaming I Need it for free or under fringe investigations channel\nRight good luck to all of you I Hope you have tremendous success up next we're going to talk about the fourth age

people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin i._r._a. instead of a gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we given investors the option don't both in their IRA\nNow explain that force\nWhen I first heard about it pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now just over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point

A. dot com\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast across we'll take your phone calls next ours we talk about this high technology artificial intelligence by Reverend Reese with us his book the force age if I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about ... I I find that the one person\nSome in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking synch with the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nThat that may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with uh\nI I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man in the car McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that was very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we didn't\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up to space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it it can if if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business than ten percent cost ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has\nA ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary very rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine\nJust hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well\nBetter I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I like the other guys all habit but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so ah it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to have\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage in wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers\n... or ... whatever country you are and and\nThird you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunate elite alone were the political cost of going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nAh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day in my room that\nYou know we're coming up to the top of the hour or so we'll we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that uh you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial meal people for example let's think about that will be back\nTo find out where you are ... speaking to the ...\nScroll down to the bottom and click Georgia's calendar\nDay October night what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the dairy move our pumpkins by the pilot has joke tracks with labor inspired when you know after a day\nIn swing mixture you break out all our great daily party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium knew I our radio ... collection that come out no\nOne ounce at birth and endured a grueling one\nHundred sixty three days in the hospital things to research funded by the march in time and I had survived immature bird the number one killer and babies in the United states the birth of the child is supposed\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that's one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back by run Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know um I I have a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if\nIf the machine can do a job to make a human do that job this word for that that's called B\nHumanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that that we invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent all the time\nExcept the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years off of the job Spanish and so you have to say how have we had\nFull employment new technology ... years right\nAnd we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody sees as it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so what ever\nIf you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it's a one back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's ...\nBillion people are going to use it what do you think that's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's\nCreated and what happens is every body Everytime technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter in delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it\nYou have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many\nThings it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled\nWe don't have robots that can that can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries will be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there are going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over figures out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that sort of big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with\nA computer can\nMay be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand\nAnd then we have these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model that in the computer\nJust take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we're we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book to for the age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed for victory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giants civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that dog official intelligent you it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing did we\nNo not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers a sibling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nAn obvious potential for chaos with them drones flying around trying to walk down the block and a drone flying ... or are they could be weaponized and and flowing into a ... a ballpark law game is on\nSo that's another thing that finally just walking remotely I was thinking about that movie late do said veto weather guy with\nThe stall was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them one of those papers and you know if they're really a reason to be at an office most of the time and truck to an office one one you could just get on the computer and do the work or on a beach [noise]\n[noise] wow that's that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things I'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations that he's been ... it's very interesting to me the large companies don't\nUsually make these leaps and the of the original doll companies uh I used to say only ones left and then it was just ... GE and so none of the companies around the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're\nYou know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt at blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and Kodak you mentioned them and I'm\nA poet the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on right blockbuster on another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're gonna have to work that out and you know where where in such early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs there's going to have your laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because ah that's very real\nWorking remote you know I I kind of\nHope so I I don't know that I Would say blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or\nYou know anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything to require a a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are in the information industry then yeah there was just there was a series of\nCommercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know should the facts from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials kind of thing for the army did\nStay with us by when you come back and take some final calls in a final chat next on coast to coast than\nThe ... website is now streamline for mobile devices Greek news if your ... simply want to enjoy our website on your boon visit goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nDepending on what kind of immigration or be there and it's hot and that are married to her chicken pox like every time\nBy our radio fantasy sports news updates\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\n\nWhat is your story ... garden lined in winning by zero one two one zero not\nThe first time caller Lyme disease when he finds you were one for siblings you want to talk to revert to the Rockies going eight hundred eight to five vines zero ... from west of the Rockies to recall eight hundred six money paid to wipe on\nThree ... use they named George nine seven three one tree in your ... misogyny they need money to nine eight seven six five to one this season goes to ... with your new or eat\nWhole next hour we're going to talk with a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe the ghost\nPhotographer looking forward to that in a moment we'll come back with Byron Reese the author of the fourth agent take your final calls on artificial intelligence\nTalking about great things you can now watching free episode of beyond belief by going to coast to coast damn dot com it's right there at the bottom of the home page you'll see that link beyond belief dot com looking for ways to\nAnd have some years here's something\nAging can make a wish for younger days but since we can't go back in time we turned to products to give us a more youthful look now there is instantly ate less with immediate results on bags into your eyes spores froze the fine\nLine and wrinkle know needle no pain just a simple cream applied lightly it's great for men and women and can easily be applied before makeup doctors agree instantly ageless works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you want to imagine ... certainly were move here under I bags were going to put into the past with our good friend Dr ...\nProducts products are going to see if it works it's kind of instantly edge slash and the idea that it was very quickly as you get paid a ...\nAnd then you pay for my little puffy heavy lifting weights in the product and when they called ... which is kind of a darling and kind of policy right now is higher than it actually last [laughter] come out I think that's on Web sites\nI can literally in the ... the median and said I Can't say countless acts like a clay minerals and making ... actually could see on the hand it had\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website HP gone dot com H.

we're almost there and and so I don't think we I Would speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering in the world\nRichie ... also known as the\nLast thing you know we live in a world a universe\nThat looks looks vaguely looks burying the uh it looks like it's waiting for us to pay a visit you know I think our ultimate destiny is a billion people each on a billion planets and ... and if you think that range\nUh I think that would be the best possible outcome because we live in this this universe and so we we got to get there are right now we're we're we've curiously balanced on this you know pale blue dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the show interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there or if you think that the way technology is progressing that when they get to that you are to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as\nWorking alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up ... fold just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can shoot grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late\nThe fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has\nA so we're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now whenever this technology\nUm\nI think that question you asked earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine\nA\nFix by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine\nA machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nThan Fenway fan now Ken ... and ... ... ... ... ... cat\nIn may and will pull him in and ... and ... it gets half an hour and I\nAm talking about automatic guns\n[noise] well I Know you're you're\nTied the guests bart is entirely right\nWe are using a ton of his weapons that may kill decision of course we've done that since landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we built machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions that part I agree with you\nBefore the smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or is it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of lakes\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's gonna out jumped\nTo very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventy fifty nothing happened what if you look studying seventeenth fifty shut up like a rocket um why because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we date the scientific method\nAnd there's no limit to where the wind is going to go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed all hungry people\nIn the world no question isn't that the world strains to feed them\nOr we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer

coast with their work the ghost photographer Julie we're going to have some fun with this one tonight\nOh we are there are we are\nAnd welcome to the show and I had the James Cameron on a about a year and a half ago talking about some of his work and what a genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is it good man to yeah man I I have a\nGreat story about him or he just allowed me and I'm like the theater where they record all the music and he said you stand here this is where the director stands in may you know the best place to hear it every day and I'm like oh I Love this guy\nYou've got a great background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly written oak\nWell how are you talking about my day job your day job we haven't gotten to the Oklahoma he'll be on the hill Billy ... [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nAnd you how did you end up in Los Angeles how did that a truck work out for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma\nAnd I made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco and then maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you writing\nStories about ghosts and interesting things\n... and that the craziest title called their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers about the fact that I mean here you are you are a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\n[noise] get out and it's it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out you know rooted and data and and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization thing you know a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence 'cause they're like way you make this a ... year that you're that nerd when he went [laughter] and and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on it\nBernie I'm I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over\nRight to our mind um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their do you have talked about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the ... and like you said not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk to your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah Bush\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand um\nA lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe in ghost\nSo we're almost the majority were barely a minority\nAnd that's grown up and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost not all saying yes every two seconds so\nNone of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey\nEither way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... thank yous journey started because of a personal situation\nYes did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um\nAnd when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph and at first it scared the heck out of me um\nI actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because\nYou know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand but aggressive if\nYou have been doing this show me what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot

and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're

course is interesting ... were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\nAre their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and and then one man's ass you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBack in the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to today you get that scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory it's all it's a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked to you about the actual planes\nAnd you know what our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a\nLine on is when this can happen again it's just a theory which are pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark the dark and he's like you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book\nI'm a at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicate that experience yeah yeah I could handle it now you would really yeah I could which you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George is like\nAll right I'll tell him All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh\nIs it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me one night and said I saw\nThat happening again and and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said how her by name as wrong as I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my accept that it\nWas not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my extent that but I think it was that man who knows\nI Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which now I mean do you feel is just your in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand\nThat I Am in charge\nI completely understand that I Am also I've become fearless\nUse the photography all ... ... it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes photography and um and ah\nAnd storytelling it would be considered um the inciting event it's it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen on the photography was you know a little scary at first because I\nIt's weird it's it's it's weird there's no doubt\nDo you know who the subject matter is or are these random ...\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has passed um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the book or doing um but other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them look like the Eighteen hundreds garb\nThey do\nThey do yeah no I I don't know if all of them are there some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looks like they had a rough time the last time\nThey and their bodies like a guy looks like
