time works in UFOs and you will you stumbled into a time warp for several months ago\nDid you [noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am\nShooting them before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology are going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that plays turned out to be ...\nFrom Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um\nI I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly\nLas Vegas an area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place\nJust in case you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but\nYou know here's this is getting dark this this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view\nWhat if George ... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a fear us talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel\nUm if they they come back and they want to enslave us again because\nA lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and\nWe just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment he made\nA one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some uh beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely um outmaneuvered anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans\nAre experimenting with some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing machine extravaganza I Am

Nineteen leaders you had all these uh I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little little showed his point of the church\nAnd I wasn't that close to leave but I just said yeah anyway I uh I went I was late getting as so I had sit in the back treacherous and services going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check\nAnd I looked up and it was my uncle just passed away whoa and and he told me he said John ... your car and I wish I was shocked I didn't know what to do it again you said jak don't value car well that was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up\nLate and what he was gone but still I Wish I knew something\nAnd so I got her at home with a friend of mine and next morning\nI called my cousin which was the son and it passed away and\nThey ask you a tape it and then bringing my collectively and I'd get him back home we shouldn't matter though so he and his girlfriend got my car and that's over the cage for them that anyway he a\nGuy my home and they pull that that ... ... and they were hit by a truck and ... and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know injured hurt I mean they had ... and I don't want to but I never told anybody there is a I\nHave a lot to say anything about it when I get till two of my close friends and um I don't like late at night but that was shown that have the I\nGuess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be ... in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was the only time I have a cat or anything like a safe ... you get all the same thing actually because I mean they're saying you\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting\nAspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientists who are the smartest folks who among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are a spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover my\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because he still Lorna\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and cathartic leave releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know he\nWas fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nArt just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua ...

I couldn't seem directly straight you know just that core I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start off and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit you really\nShow theirselves and he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone's watching them and I was just wondering might\nHuh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full news and I can tell you what it it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there you\nKnow I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nWhile he's in hospital where do you think Josh [noise] well ...\nThank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet in touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and\nThe ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of uh\nCold spot or a cold when what they call it an eye on when I'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and it reminds me of how something like a magnet has\nThis invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together\nAnd certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd Josh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially at Ashville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Rowan Oak island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery of the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating fell on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com is no period after the peach Joshua pie Warren dot com this Saturday October Thirteen in Hollywood\nTwo to four pm it is my final wishing

interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter and uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story on Halloween feature story\nAnd so I started to write a story about um local goes legends around the area where I was born\nAnd a reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and ghost stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're retired\nYou know it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to as the season of Matt now [laughter]\nI Love it is kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely and how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I\nFor I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I've found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already a and that people have compiled\nA numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple go stories with\nTales of synchronous cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to a regular guy\nThat that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nOr you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the the stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little the corn oh we're customs less than was\nAnd you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is that right I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they say that this ... in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that\nBecause these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunker they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle the ball ...\nThe website is now could be newly optimized for mobile but if you're close to ... you can listen to live in Massachusetts right

world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes are strange ...\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I think\nAlmost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was a great story of those yeah that's\nAn amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was a ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what heat witness was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at it setting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nWoman and they shot against the math you people could hear ... sounds yeah and we're hitting something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book map you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about a ... after World War two if you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor um there's\nA lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship based a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on their\nUh and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah they're the a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to\nWhen we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew swim we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break math you a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to ... as a ghost\n... well there

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew I'm it off Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold ah you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there'll people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's\nA philosophy was influenced by a cult groups like the full society in the real society\nVery prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers and astrologers so I came away with a little bit\nOf a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so\nThere were the wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime or they held um meetings and the ... got together\nWith the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nYes ah the allied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved into trying to use spiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding\nSo those were a different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm\nI'm really I Know a lotta people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a uh some of these stories with really preconceived notions and then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I really when I started writing hard rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah\nAnd ah you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of\nA historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and the like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories and these tales of the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to musician\nA person that witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still
