necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties food water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers that can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three\nAnd three or four years for hearing bull crap\nOut early you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that we don't have\nEnough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum\nThat's what they will do right so it's not decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and

misdemeanor\nAnd they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these ... properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against them they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo but already or you're at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so there are picky right down there and\nYou know you get justice dispensed right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever\nSo it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what

planted acts story Linda the just just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and they need becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcasts then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt in New York cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shaped residue of rock dust and ice left over from our solar systems creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes\nMuch further starting where the ... rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and the fear Rickles shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine when indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply cause the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to dwarf planet in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great\nThat it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object\nTo cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking super ... territories in Hawaii to\nFind planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying\nTo mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than\nNeptune a good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary scientists department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the ... is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the ... up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected also the upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nNot going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but\nIt's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbation an even keel thing the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it\nIt'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's\nFinally found this new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories um where might have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nNot they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter like do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has all of this is just speculation\nCan probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like that too\nWe think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere it probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what the border of\nThe idea that

George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so there's really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the IT cc report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on her my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThen they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades ago\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska duty rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get ... of such migrants at one point five degrees but\nYou had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees and that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally wants to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we could expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from Lola choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war ... and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises fair\nSo does that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head and the same mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more gas and we bring more wars\nYes there you go\n... well it is a terrible hitter if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the next rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that all the forty eight continental US state\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking that title flooding\nThe researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida\nWell have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already one of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs it they get flooding constantly on full moon ticket constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly\nFlooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami is nonsense\nThat got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic\nHas melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that I mean that most of the southern tip of a foreign will be uninhabitable\nAnd that leads back to what drew ... professor drew shall we say\nWe're going to have more with Linda in just a moment on the coast to coast am so don't touch your daughter\nMissed a need to make sure I guess one of those in the ... some

on my Wednesday evening beginning at seven thirty PM mountain and another time around the country in the world\nI've been in my office where I'm Talking tonight in front of it and share with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on ... category for it\nIs the very distressing subject of half cats beheaded cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just a phony deflection\nThat he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem and air force base a that's down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise]\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes link to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies them I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they\nBut but I started receiving these emails and one came from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIs provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazards\nAre talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now some city center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired so after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and Fenway open them again and\nThrough the window I can see this misty\nGray bomb drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling\nSlowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming writes in my head and I was just\nRaising the fascination of I didn't know what you're saying then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is which is living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all being answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming\nI wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because the feeling was so loving\nAnd you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you I'm wasn't like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitch were almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... but they had the same texture in the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were ... minutes at the same time and they would just float buying the kind of neat at the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like an downloaded information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything\nThat was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was beginning\nAlmost like I knew every answer to every question like I was is super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me\nIt wasn't for now at that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall misinformation because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving
