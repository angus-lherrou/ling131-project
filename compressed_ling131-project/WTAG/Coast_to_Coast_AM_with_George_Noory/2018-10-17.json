light in shadow on the ... records and his latest as his book called rod Serling his life work and imagination and Nicholas I got to tell you I'm looking forward to this\nJokes and I thank you very much for having me in a thank you for that very nice in the introduction\nRod Serling was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again a he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great grapes or shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone or in the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word\nUm I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and and also I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nNot getting any many black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is you know not quite right and it's lasted all this time because of of rocks messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced\nSo well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so\nThat's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had what's called the after dark newsletter\nIn Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... by shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office but raw didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script on you know Robert Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific and that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes\nNinety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced you never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just the deck and he was just addicted

get your free\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nHey and welcome back to the coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick Perri see with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role well\nHe he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did right and you know a collection of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells you know he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThat there's going to be a ... of the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out a is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a coke credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right\nYou know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's\nAnother thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know\nCarol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own universe or a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know\nIt is and and the show was so yeah as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction\nFantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know relive his youth and go back to it and easier less stressful life\n... ... it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to swell distance yes they're both\nVery similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big seemed to serve on was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic uh\nAnd is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know that's\nThat's the river and there's just so many good in the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the uh he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling is very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater or he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that they think just\nTaunting him and it drove him crazy after a while the ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per

the networks now they'll think\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIt's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the SATs which to me was as far as the visual impact was which was a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget you\nKnow it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know young actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford actually got his first\nJob not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house\nIn a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom [laughter] it's\nCalled the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode and the\nOne that really gave me the message of people was the shelter about the fallout shelter\n[noise] yeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half\nHour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and miniature was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated\nSo it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years or in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident hum a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my second question would be about\nThe mysterious endings which\nNew one\n\nComes in\nTo talk to George Nouri called the wild card line that eight one each vibe zero one for one zero in on the first time

ending and you went gradually backwards at the beginning [laughter] um but no that that's that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year um outer limits came after it but I Believe a one step beyond what started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma Edward taken away\nIn Georgia and Nick\nSterling man he was ... he had the ability to be able to understand human nature 'cause if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know everyone wanted his shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe the cap that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and Bob coming it's just having me walking by seeing this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert and he went back in time what you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd relive the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room and haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on that newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show in the closer the ending of it the nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows ... did\nHe had a time machine you know one of them this guy you know way back in time three different times and he thought he would try to alter events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that only failed\nIt one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany they're already thought he could alter that event\nOf course\nBut a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney\nPlayed the ah Santa Claus in a department store and that call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was\nAll a shrine\nWhen he got a break from the farmer story went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was the man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back out and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags to all of a sudden became full of gifts that did it uh you know and pecans\nAnd he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that ran a department store they found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nTaking the PlayStation and the department store owner came in there so yeah there it is there is the merchandise call well you're the Bob are by you know\nAnd the guy's name was Mr done department store right and and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty can it right\nThere so they had to let him go of course store owner sitting here scratch if they had the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raised in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\nHuh you know sit merry Christmas and both of them got pretty pretty toasted on wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer and ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this while its own future film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I've been to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart

one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out the way things usually working life\nReally that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball\nCards from the
