greetings from team buck Hungary I took her advice and started watching the first season of picky blinders\n'em and last night it was awesome I'm hook thanks for the recommendation I'm all for the next week and that is what I'll be doing in the evenings low but you do brother keep it up shields Hi Gary Gary she'll try to you I'm so glad you liked the blinders on I really\nI really do enjoy it I I think it's a very entertaining very well done very entertaining show a little bleak for sure but\nIt's a it's well executed the writing is good and and there's some very interesting twists and turns in it\nI I started watching the third season of daredevil over the weekend which I Would have to say you know the thing about daredevil is that it it's also a little bit dark a little bleak I think it's well executed for what it is I just can't understand\nHow they made daredevil such a compelling show at Netflix\nAnd they made iron fist which was just on washable garbage in iron fish was crash it's also a superhero story also set of New York same you know platform with Netflix you'd think they'd have some idea how to do it the iron fist got cancelled and thank heavens because it was such\nA piece of of waste\nAnd ah anyway but yeah I I have to say I think that daredevil three so far as the little slow and getting going but so far it's it's pretty well done I find the acting all very good I I enjoy the performance is even if you're not that into super hero stuff\nI think you might like daredevil I I think you might find daredevil to be a pretty good show\nA Carla\n... wash U and ... the other day with a B loved her comment about someone writing his comments about the bomber on teleprompter like no one ever did that before I Love the show so all the pick of you and your parents in D.C looks like your dad has the same swoop\nCarla thank you for that kind of comments about my parents I'm Bret Baer I I think that I was able to say exactly what I really wanted to you on the circumstances which is always which I think is a very important for whenever you get one of those performances whenever you're doing that I also went on Shannon show on friday as you guys know\nSo that was another chance for me to say what was really\nOn my mind uh and uh after my dad yeah my dad has\nGreat hair it's true great hair he's got he's got a silver swoop now in fact I could probably be his call signs silver scoop\nBut it was so good to see my parents um I got the best parents in the world so that's a big advantage that I've had in life you know I Know you've probably got great parents too but they're your parents are probably second best parents world I think modern number one but we can agree to disagree on that\nUh so it was it was great to see them we a lot of fun and it's like to get some visitors down here in the swat man the swamp can feel a little little lonely not enough team bucking the swamp got to be honest routine but you guys are spread out all around the

liberal\nCalifornia do about the fact that we are surrounded by these crazies well\nYou know it's uh there's no easy answers um I Wish I could say that I had a a straightforward do this to tell you but you know I think you engage where you can and that's it you know you you do where do you think it's a bad idea\nIt's not worth it sometimes Jennifer right table yesterday I attended a lecture presentation by Arthur Sulzberger Germany in New York Times called the impact of media and truth on democracy\nI went with an open mind is I always try to approach things in life this way because many people surprise me over the years\nHowever I found Sulzberger statements so cliche is an interesting he said all the things you talked about recently on your show speaking truth to power how we live in dangerous times journalist or unsafe et cetera et cetera I lost track of how many times to use the words danger or dangerous\nHowever he's definitely a capitalist he bragged about I'm In New York times successfully mounted monetize their online media and when asked a question from the audience about how the New York times could be more accessible middle class Sulzberger said\nThe cost of ... New York times is worth it in order to get the truth\nWhen you find yourself in northern California again I could ... have you speak at a local university we need to hear a more conservative voices especially on campuses in California keep finding a good fight shields Hi Jennifer\nOh thank you Jennifer for that interesting perspective and and telling me what's going on with that Sulzberger lecture that that's not surprising all by the way the New York times is in many ways the most arrogant\nOf all media out there and and it's left wing and I don't know how many of you saw at the last week I asked their chief White House correspondent for the New York times are you a liberal paper and he said no\nAnd I just look at it I'm like dude I I understand that you know that's the that's the company line but come on man\nReally we're we're going to do this we're really going to do the New York times is not liberal he goes oh the editorial pages liberal but the overall\nPaper is is just a newspaper no that is not true the New York times as liberal paper and they should just own it you know that they shouldn't beat around the Bush and pretend or something that they're not I don't see this is really all that\nComplicated I really don't but they they make a complicated because they like\nThe pretense of being neutral they think that neutrality and objectivity heightens the strength of their voice whereas if they admitted to partisanship even though they're hyper partisan then they could not claimed to just be this is our troops objectivity they're clearly not\nThat up and we'll stop what's ah what's up with this one a book\nYou miss the anniversary of the battle for Pancho bread and your right I Am so sorry\nI forgot to tell you guys all about ... if you want to go to go to Google and type in the ... show and the battle of ... and you can listen to the old the Pancho chauffeur old time sick you're right I did miss ... anniversary this year though I'm I'm slipping in my old age Tyler writes love your show man shield side Tyler\nYou're the man thank you I'm going to end on that tonight because I like it ... to and to all of your own home shields\n[noise] might have seen the headlines from last week or so now they're starting to blame social media sites that don't do enough in order to get rid of the content that they decide is violent\nWho's day oh that's right the left wing media the people that are trying to tell you that there are progressive ideology\nJust so happens to constantly results in the censorship of conservative but you know it's the algorithm and there's nothing really going on there\nMalarkey you know if you want a place where you can go and share your thoughts that Snoopy dot com [noise] I've got to be dot com account and I love being able to interact with folks there and read their posting and know that the post is the post okay\nYou get to have your opinion heard you don't have to worry about any of the rest of censorship or nonsense from Facebook\nSniffy dot com thousands of team buck folks have already signed up and join you should check it out for yourself as an I.

Kavanaugh and it was a it was spelled or hurt him okay it wasn't a spelled to bind him\nThe binding spell was on Donald Trump a binding spell just means that whatever he decides to do won't work out that things will find confusion in his presidency and it seems that may be that spell is working on Donald Trump is just seems that whatever he's doing people try to undermine\nAnd and so the working in that respect I don't know if I mean people will disagree or agree whether or not Donald Trump as effective as a president but when they gave him that binding spell it was supposed to bind him so that everything he does is undermine but the difference between a binding smell on Trump and the hurtful spell that they put on Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh was supposed to feel something in this and Thomas

have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it has to a large degree um\nI Hope they're replacing those trees or are they oh I don't I don't know [laughter] I Hope so yeah I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful manner very ecological manner\nI mean that's not what greed another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in the last school it's Seventy thirty I mean think about\nReally use it that high on that's a flood lip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you want you you wanna hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions and they're going to want us\nYeah oh excellent ones absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being going right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... they're going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially he's the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these you know they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are like that I'm hearing about this\nBut let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find it just got to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWell listen here here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want what you want to you want it now you don't you want to free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have some positions that the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're\nDying so oh no we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\n[noise] [noise] yeah what he told me that makes me cringe you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me early does we knew not it's\nNot what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean it looks and I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but\nWhen you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that do you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's\nMore information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other in I've never seen that this bad him you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ... ... I I Can't tell you the number of people George that say to me you know why don't we run our [noise] our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise] if you think about it\nI'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no you know we were just taken all do we have removed the rules of taking away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what will\nWhat's going on with China China's freaky position China right now uh they\nRelaxed they were uh their their child law to write how many people are on many children a family can help\nYeah that can happen really as many as they want

that but\nThat that's just like I Can't think of any ... any other way to say what they've done is they've committed the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child policy\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but ah how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born as adults\nThey're not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they're missing now and it's a real number five hundred million people that were born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian I honor your your\nUnited States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes that have been big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well that will lead cook themselves because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've gotta support that can support themselves and now\nThey they have a whole new crop of of the kids\nCan support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're\nDoing it on the go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've ever won the war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to Dave in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high\nOkay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have\nI called because I have a phone compact with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nUm he's not a ... so all of those politicians that have looked in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to say two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the orange star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he could run and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white include and his wife and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights\nYou look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm the I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself it's that's men and women don't have time for non ...\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact\nThat you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy doesn't win wars diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman\nI voted for him because he's a no nonsense is is\nThat anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up yet on the horse\nI that I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows with than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about this policy she knows school yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\nWell ... ... regarding running the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption in the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even try to get in the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star and in our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas\nI'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but I'd rather be a little more presidential more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and the\nUh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify\nIt the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nAnd ten years from now we can sell it on ... for ten times what we pay\nAnd you can also get it on\nAll right stay with us we'll be back in the moment what's ... phone calls with Ken ground

I said what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you know possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen there with the north and the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also a scenic says become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift ahead we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ...

B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it\nBut I I think there is and I can from this with with dean because he's doing and and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly\nA supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast years out there dealing with the paranormal uh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting\nBigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're\nYou're right and that's exactly what I've seen as people have come forward or you know colleagues and\nUh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that ah it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building a night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and\nAnd saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster with\nBruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's\nMy my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally stiff I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear and uh\nAnd I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it's like I I that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and\nI was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\nYeah they actually ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air it was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in the warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers up there for you I Want to come back in the mall but we'll talk more about some of

back to coast to coast George ... what's your we're back with Bruce ... book is called timeless Bruce what about any demonic situations you've stumbled into that\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare\nAnd then we proceeded to the uh the base and uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know in a very apocalyptic event that or\nLife changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had none of those two we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but uh she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a\nVerified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this is the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied\nUh I think a dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to let them see\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger\nA ...\nOn the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips on the Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh\nUh tried to read each other's mine so she would send you know she'd have a card she'd look at it and send me the you know tried to send me with what the card was and uh ... well above chance we would get the the suit right\nWe would get the sometimes the number or the or the you know whether it was a\nKing or jak face card a very often we get we get it a right to the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter blue collar guy no\nNonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it no more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that\nShe's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this it was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south and\nUh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a\nIt was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and\nA ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nOr the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep Dr ...\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going you keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking about that this was in fact\nThere's been there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taking a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway and the dark total dark\nYup or get shot out or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience\nWhat about the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you which is the favorite for you\n[noise] well I I don't want to you actually like\nYeah I [noise] I'll have to say it all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me an inhibition after she had passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but very healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was golden had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's what she told me and then that was it that was that was one of the parents so that\nThat's where she was that's always a good

Bruce all sold high with us of course we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket or the title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a I'm In a Norwegian American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe're at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it\nOf a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was hoping to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh I'm okay and uh I I I looked I kinda I looked around I looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that\nOkay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what the issues they're very curious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but ah\nWell do you have to fight for\nIt I didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is offered it at the college\nAnd I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get\nMaybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but\nThere are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which\nWill be fun a that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think the ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the two ... where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my\nImpression that are in my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... A M visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not like out in the in the open kind of thing\nSo I think there there is a difference between an intelligent\nWhat they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nCycle ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter\nHappened to you\n[noise] I was the uh the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of these things happened in Germany and West Germany Germany's a very magical place\nUm the ah I'm living in an old uh well in an apartment above a ... house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I\nI felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed\nIt was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off the bed so I got up and there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving and it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time or her hand mirror a clock\nAnd a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off\nAnd I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window and\nGeorge Foreman Denise round of the rumble in
