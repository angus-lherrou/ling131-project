{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "In your tone I Love it Chris and Chris I just I I think that there's ... there's an adaptation going on in my thinking\nAnd it's maybe something I've been a little slower than some of my other colleagues on the right to adopt in some ways because I come from this perspective of\nWell this'll sound self aggrandizing but knowledge having a background in in the actual work that I Do especially in the national security side knowledge in fact and wisdom that's how I Try to approach would I Do and and so I always want to\nThat I could have liberals listen to this show and I certainly hope to all the liberals who are listening that they still feel this way\nBut I Want them to know that I I Want to bring them over to my side a and I don't want to be too strident that has always been my approach but recently the left has gone insane and so I Am separating out in my mind\nI Want to say in saying I mean more insane than usual I separated in my mind how I speak to Democrats really in general from how I'm now speaking to the hardcore left because I Am an ideological war with the hardcore less a centrist Democrats\nI Want to come over to my side not necessarily even on everything but on whatever they're willing to put the hardcore left just must be ideologically smashed and\nAnd destroyed it must be defeated you know the ... the ah the people that are running around with the pink hats on and that are saying due process doesn't count anymore and they they the ones who are doing deep platform and want people to be boycotted and to be fired from their jobs for\nExpressing conservative opinions when we have to fight that ideology not not meet it in\nA gentlemanly contest but we actually have to throw some elbows and that that maybe has been a a learning process for me in this Arab Trump because I've seen more and more of what the left\nAnd not just with the left is but how much of the Democrat Party and how much of the ideological a center left they control\nAnd the hard left them in the progressive vanguard is way too prominent way too powerful and can and cannot be\nA just wished away any more so if I sound at all like I'm a little more strident or a little more uh fired up about things in the last few months it's really because I've seen what this battle we're entering into is all about\nAnd this is political total war this is not a you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak and in that kind of political environment you you have\nTo be ready to to go bare knuckle an end in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump you know there there have been some things\nThat Trump has Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that's such a mistake oh my gosh how could Trump if have gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize who were dealing with with Trump\nUh and then time passes and I realized wait a second he was right not to apologize for that they would have just mould him like a like a a school say a flock of ... but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging Peron has a ... they they would have turned him apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well and make changes\nAnd I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear every day [noise] yes I like to present information and there's an aspect\nOf this that's a really just about dare I say it's far from the left community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I equip\nThose who listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs either ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and I and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and it's never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time\nBrad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she makes such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty\nI'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing ... earlier\nSo us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home ... thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the podcast is out sooner and I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast now is that we're pretty much now are pod cast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo ... there's no problem with you deciding that you're going to just\nGet a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to it a little early ... you don't have to wait and wait for it to be rebroadcast or to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume puck is uh and so that's great news that you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary under a security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just completely it should've been terrifically embarrassing\nFor anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense\nThat she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nWhat am I on you all that

came home and and ah discovered the the sane and horse notified the law enforcement and an automated Lee and\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I Divide that this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together a green the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this quarter and wants to take over to go to Jackie in California hijacked your ground zero\n[noise] Oh hi Clyde yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\nLike I had known show gets ... ...\n... you know\nSo you had a [noise] the Turks came out and\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys over there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is\nHave you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is ah between a rock and a hard spot now\nBecause you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this as a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWell ... like I said this is an example of worldwide\nBeads stay manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence with this ... this happening\nAnd and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by well\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy or Asian or look\nAt the un other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when cars show ...\nIs a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which\nMakes him on Saudi territory\nWe have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president in states has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to leak the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh they moved out of the country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the hit team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it team\nProbably do the same reason or you say they use in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey argue with the CIA was facilitating operation deeply an opportune argument that he said operatives in the high a poor facilitators to the murder of this uh uh of of cars Yogi\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian us to be said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can be gives the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you wouldn't want an innocent is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you've got bone and who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's a am old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies\nAnd we had an immediate gasoline shortage there was a long lines for gasoline yep and they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even\nOn that I think they went by the last number of your plate so I remember I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gas up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day and then that day she gets up the other car\nAnd because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed\nAnd you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now if they fall back on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means a that we're going to fall back on our oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo it'd be looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nOr easily by ... I don't know does does a Trump want to call their bluff\nNo idea that advances debate and retaliate\nSo I'll watch and wait now right that's why I brought this up because I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about Joe ... show and I thought what am I talking about and then I realized oh I Know what this says I looked over and I figured\nWell gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America stabilized this from the pomp stabilizes with inflation destabilized this with an economy that's going to go by and then what will we have the will have to be put on a war footing by by Christmas Time\nRight and and remember the key thing is though if if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the house\nDo you think this is a well once again the deep state so what do you say the deep state intelligence ops wanting to make Trump look bad and making them up\nAnd I said that's a nice days so I mean this could do it\nLooked at it I think we have to look at turkey here born in the in the shaky footing the or the wall is on with his\n... dropping like Iraq right and and I and he got ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible that this is a a a\nForm of a coup chance within Saudi Arabia that we are still interest served to serve to help a turkey get back in August ...\nWe'll see what happens Peter we'll see what happens right now I I look don't it doesn't look too good Peter ... thank you ... they give Tripoli victim at three thirty seven hundred will be back\nWhen mine\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we train tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\n\n[laughter] no I\nDon't remember how I don't know when they are wondering how\nYou will be hard\n[noise]\n\nIt's like to\nPoint to shut [laughter] may even be more apparently\nI'm our government they're called as valid as it has been made anybody there had either and I wonder how\nI hadn't even hell I found that the state is it has to be a group of people they believe are trying to undermine down\nWhich is ridiculous because no one has undermined out more than Donald Trump\n\n[noise] the only\nWe use over the world\n\n\nI'm quite Louis\nYou're listening to ground zero a lot of people are saying and this is something interesting to see the writing me telling me that we're supposed to be independent now of oil we produce more oil and Saudi Arabia well the question I had been is it worth that would that\nDivision why is gas so damn high right now I don't get it I mean we've we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even up to five fifty a gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon\nAnd uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much of the fact is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into the sphere that some somebody would wake up to ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something is happening\nAnd I don't know the the the the world down anything is possible anything we speculate about the past is coming true it's it's just weird how you know and and it can you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in a in a in a moment of scarcity\nWhen I talked about weeks ago with what the Henry Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity\nIn order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services in and and make everything uh a happy global family see this is what they're pushing for an outside interest and outside interested is not\nAmerican Constitution republic it's not democracy it's something else they want and they they they need to make their dance in trauma they need traumatized enough to be ready because they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty\nThat's where they would say that due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a in that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George in Kentucky I George on ground zero\nHey I how about your scenario will I think you're right about the state but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that day rallies way Trump has to ignite public\nOn both directions good and bad or we have and it\nSure we have George George though these are like the way the white light but\nDon't you know you need to acknowledge the fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be major but I think the next one coming up is it will all of a sudden with these stabilized with this tape state airing involved in all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're\nGoing to hold off on the elections and we'll just carrying we truly too we staple what country do you think it was so\nThis is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you would think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I did what we\nKnow it's not stupid if you think about it well it ... it would lay that loss you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you your Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the point is between the neo Nazis planned everything that's going on I think about all the ... going on and what this is set up for an Emmy ... if you look at it in a respect\nNo that's not going on it's not happening but then you go okay well that can't happen but it is happy with it all the diversity like that's happening\nWith every bite out a little up or you got all these a fraction of the people that are just ... fit about everything in the country if you look at things\nWill be stabilized everywhere\nWe are being labeled ... at the time all the countries all the countries that ah you don't want to hold onto their sovereignty and their freedom or being destabilize it right the United states is a big ... that's when they want they want done\nThe top I don't like Trump but I'm just saying I don't buy it\nBut he got he\nGot ... ...

Crump study with us this is disappointing and sad so\nIt is most definitely that yeah he was a well he was very instrumental in Nineteen Ninety three when Congress kill the NASA steady program he was one of four high tech figures that\nStepped in with the money to keep SETI going and that was Paul Allen of course but a bill Hewlett David Packard and Gordon Moore and those are all familiar names\nFor anybody who's tuned into technology and of course Paul Allen was co founder of Microsoft with Bill gates Nineteen Seventy five\nHe also you know later on in the late Nineteen nineties\nUh chipped in about thirty million dollars to do the research and development in the beginning construction of what's called the Allen telescope array that three hundred miles north of San Francisco that we use every day to look for eighty\nCents was he contributing money uh up until the time he died or had that stopped\nWell he did it episodic Lee so he wasn't the you know regularly contributing money recently though you know it the big big chunks of time where he wasn't but he was interested he you know he was interested in any kind of\nNew discovery that could be made thanks to new technology technology which is of course the way he made his fortune he saw it as a you know the facilitating if you will fuel for new discovery and I think that's why I got interested in SETI\nWould it be amazing stuff that uh if you get that signal that you've been looking for with all the other groups from city that ah you dedicated to pull out\nHis well his name is on the telescope into maybe

...\nMid November yet I mean maybe not that many racing the car you're ahead of your head of your time my ...\nBrother hey we're talking space here again we'll talk this time about November it'll be an incredibly busy month for space 'cause that'll be placing some thirty of these small cube set satellites about the size of a shoe box into space\nAnd one of them George that stands out in my mind is a little space craft cold the orbital reflect or get a little ... it's a small ... satellite which will then unfurl itself in space looking like about maybe the size of a length of to school buses\nAnd there'll be maybe as like a big long reflective sword in the sky will be visible in the night sky for weeks but here's the interesting thing about this George that's actually created by an artist named ... of the museum of art\nSo now we're going to be seeing art in space and not only of course in the future when we see individuals like artist pig in that first manned trip around the moon with space six\nBut George you got to see as many people that amazing launch a vet SpaceX rocket itself\nWas great it was gorgeous\nYou unfortunately I missed it but here's the scoop that we've been talking about here folks get set for the next the many launches but one that's come into my mind George is a falcon nine bought five rocket that will be launching approximately this is what they say at least eight sometimes can change on Halloween anything October the thirty first\nThey're eight pm Pacific daylight time and of course people along the California coast you know exactly where to go because there's many of these public viewing areas\nBut maybe this one will not be a spectacular because you need that near sunset launch\nBut George going back quickly to Florida we find that people are asking what are we going to have the next big Falcon Heavy launch now I'm a schedule it shows November the thirtieth at seven pm that would be great\nBut many space scientists are saying realistically will have to push this back to march twenty nine fame\nAnd finally in the lives sky don't forget folks the moon coming to the first quarter about the sixteenth you'll get to see that it's the best time George to take a look them but not others and telescopes to see the amazing mountains in craters in their ... the boat in bars or close on the night of the exam\nAnd then we're

of spirituality Mitch has also oh in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch is a very popular Boyz of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days well a\nToday is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've cross with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do\nOn your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group ah their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group that side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting with San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on\nThey weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group that the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether at us and ultimately did that\nBut he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are positive I Believe that if\nYou walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally\nAnd reasonably expect to arise from circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident that was the mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabbled with the dark side tend to do some of ... the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we faced these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today\nI think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts change the brand\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWoodward human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it\nWorks they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I write about in the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind just the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ordinance\nThat we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nWhich we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nNext hour we'll take phone calls questions and miracle stories\nDon't forget to watch a TV show beyond belief with George ...

neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and they'll roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day\nMemorize it and when the results arrive express things that the method we can all do it is easy isn't that once you get into it\nIs easy the the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim\nEnormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that when you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism they become an enormously powerful what is it a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourself\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating and and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times\nI never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that are protesting myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nWhere you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do
