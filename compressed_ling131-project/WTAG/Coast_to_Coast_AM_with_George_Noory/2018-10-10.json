the upside down thinking\nMarch ... what did your peers say and your colleagues would you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nLet's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy\nThe ... mission to look as a cycle can he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's\nThe type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain that comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true\nAnd I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled or ones again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran\nA lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent ones over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once as heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic and and people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around events\nThat we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a time I had a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me\nIs that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic\nBut the if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nTenant be taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've\nHeard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller ... than the ones\nThat there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending within the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo\nYou know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that sounds totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name mark over and they are K G.

that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up your this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond what was the nation perhaps they give them into a window into a reality that we typically do it with her eyes that I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies\nKnown as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ever sat the hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... party out from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma\nIn many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier\nSometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the defender later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamped\nAnd we know when the ... later went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experiencing memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark you're on six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nThough I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist Anna materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the\n... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious and shows like there is no God or no devil I Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing you ... know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it sort of question your whole\nPremise by talking about side medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... anti depressants or major tranquilizers ...\nBack chemically the brain and therefore they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical have the brain through these medications or even an aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nGoing back to like ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the mines dusting that show and here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain and a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just does remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UCA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for a ban on the show\nSo I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise] I tell the comment was set on but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week I had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian and ... and then\nMhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ...\n...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ... outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us\nYes sir I'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately what me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something

never seen a U.S I never see what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I Kevin put

that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things steam and just said we're on our way isn't it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on even know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field to fix\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counterintuitive there's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nSo there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly\nThis it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and into upside down thinking\nThank

talk about ghost stories that we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goes chronicled stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me look good for to the next Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know very wonderful one when I was at that age you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and hey if you live on it now and it's not a high priest ... salmon and ill often when I was younger you are walking around town you know dressed in her\nHer guy and very regal looking very um\nBig presents for a person\nAnd ... at the time people will come or rude open arms you did they go oh my God user which\nYeah that's a great question she you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seem to be at those\nDays it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town of Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed the whole way they look at it now\nYou know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations psyche trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your sibs movie what year who did the start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted\nTo I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talked to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nDo readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight\nSo I never really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever pass dome stories from one to the other but you could ...\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe maybe five\nYears before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said so\nThat the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he\nHad to do it on something so he chose you know doing it and go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would um but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house just using them\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWould have you conclude about what this may be are we a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think there are varying\nDegrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nYou know do a closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stress from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have\nSomething go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nUm doesn't mean that you're going to have a spirit that's a hundred percent you know wonderful and nice\nThis audio is for your review for ...

the event that I Do and and that was a [noise]\nAt the old dancing cockatoo a and we were doing they public goes to raise money for the Mets and uh I was in the\nLibrary there are a bookstore I guess it's a better word for it and I'm a member of the Mets came in and she told her all about uh\nHow they used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of a floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished it with us be on one side and then I get up and began to talk\nSuicide began to speak for the books from behind me came\nFlying into the middle of the room in front of thirty five PCs and there's no way they would just fall\nNo it didn't it was like just fall down behind me I mean they come flying by the end\nLike somebody was throwing them at you\nExactly the and like I said with thirty five people saw it I didn't see and unfortunately because my back was started to it but I thought the book but by and screams [laughter]\nDo you think there was somebody back tossing they met you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but there was just a law where\n... ... what has for you than on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... did\nNot by the by the living at home\nAnd I first book a ghost chronicles is ... is the second book on the series a\nMarine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumping called me up and asked me to check out his house so I get ... you know we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big do uh in the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nOne of ... separated me from the other one and the other one talked to my rain we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he wanted Murray and come back and well but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter] yeah\nShe was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment run do you bring with you\nA it very on on on a particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people but more of a piece of equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to bring the proper\nEquipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... being seen you might\nBring more video equipment or you know like ... or ... whatever that you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies avoiding we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across that I'm Sorry what was the worst in the visualization of ...\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ghost hunting but more while I was just doing normal stuff\nYeah I work with a\nLot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one guy do these goes to his 'cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this\nUm [noise] it's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you and say use windows all around you\nCan absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for ... at CERN continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just novice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in and yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat ... is with the coast got because it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing woman walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm\nAn I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes on ah what island lighthouse in Bedford pool meal Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards a kitchen that's our dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says why would you see and I just had our dog she says can you describe it I said sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe the dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog actually died and I don't she says the doggie described pretty much matches\nBecause of the dog that\nThat of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was it do I know but so I mean he has two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back

Maureen with us and we're going to take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron how're you doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] so how often do you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but are there are so many group so like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... you have to do was knew there was like twenty four in the country and all this like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael does just that image know of the ... the center right now has a Scarlett I don't know if you've seen that\nYet or no I haven't seen that yeah it's pretty that's you're already is our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing down from four to nothing that would be good [laughter] I think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of tickle area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you kind of you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for yeah strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house cleanse is something we're not going to do it without you know are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nAll right thank you for taking my call ...\n... um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next coming or being a lot better hopefully things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you that's for sure yes [laughter] yes\nAt what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right\nUm and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that you can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day change are really trying to put\nIt on the mask but you're not feeling it is that correct or no [noise] uh right yeah yeah okay right\nSo put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person it feels like a lot of people the one that comes to when they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone I was there\nYeah yeah okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough and is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine that these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween\nSeason or does it matter\n[laughter] ...\n[laughter] it it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween season
