complicit in this uh Nader\nAh from New York they're all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over a thick ideology known as left as him and I think it's pathetic and the far reaching

decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman

had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House says president sexually groping in molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House and that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard in in the bigger double than it has to do more with men ... me too movement and trying to to I\nLove how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too because a bunch of left this lecture it's Hollywood lefty okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on your news and he's old school actresses and all these ... political feminist\nTaking pictures at Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while\nEnabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts out\nAnd then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being built ended up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against\nA high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and certainly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster\nChild I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms positions with somebody ah Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all of their connections but they couldn't care less about Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein and access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughters end of the character posted in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable\nBut you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there and a daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about cause harm people take advantage of them but the the what the what rocket bombing selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy the lecture is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with him but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale\nFor many many boys I said many times

two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a more\nIn Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand it completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars MS Thirteen other gang bangers to provide a passage Everytime you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money so you didn't pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible\nTrump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during the election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to ... billion has been pumped into these campaign\nOr buy a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others in order to uh to me are Republicans all over the country get get get me over the next two weeks ... how's this going to play out at like ... or early on November the sex\nBut Democrats have missed every find they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate people want our border protected so they and they also get that this is fake news it's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand how and so\nWhat prompted the right thing he said Honduras these people show up they're losing their aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and said look\nIf these people get where you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we're going to look at the age were able to send to you so Mexico's deploying military on the southern border got just heard this\nLiterally today good\nSo Mexico's going at it Honduras I bet you will send buses the say ... you're going to get back to our country or else\nAnd and the what the ... how's it going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand they think that there's some issue that's going to be the ... the you know the ... the division point with Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they can just come anytime they want\nSo whether whether it's the kind you back or whether it's

Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth vote\nOf the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them rulemaking powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of for businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very expensive for business is one of the estimates that I had in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nDo that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses are individuals each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me ...\nAnd the idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in\nAnd begin to review carefully the legislation\nUnder which all of these rules are made and very frequently um the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago I'm kind of generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called digital fortitude they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations\nOf um of administrative agency then we can actually begin to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nWallison let's go back in time to the hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument ... of government because it best reflects the will of the people\nOne thousand three hundred and eighty it's now October twenty Eighteen I assume another three thousand role is going to go in effect so unless Brett Kavanaugh and other four justices said this is unconstitutional it will continue well we got her on\nEnd up Peter Jay Wallace into bogus judicial fortitude the last chance to rein in the administrators state and Peter thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and you're a great American\n[laughter] ...

work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archived for missing people articles I just started a poem and put them in a folder and over the years that got

learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with the super wealthy came to me and they have in this room and\nAnd they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the heroes\nAnd they found each other later in business and in a weird sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR\nYou're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six\nTo eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California and I coordinate down in the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek were the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nApple blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the pipette went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to a\nJordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen back came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was ... than a crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I worked together to introduce Melba to a very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit with a scientist who\nReads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big but ... hair take us into the break\n\nUm Harry in\nOh\nDon't ask me why\n\nDid not fall ... ... ...

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different and one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any\nWild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found and that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the\nWriters who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it\nMust have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\n\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a cynic long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds\nYou had a notation at the bottom that does that maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explorer notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I die and actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church latter day saint church and it's in there so\nSay that these things haven't happened ridiculous\nOn the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques valet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a record it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here Hubbard being that we're seeing briefly and disappeared now\nThat's the kind of thing that will drive a big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a book on about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that go shit topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm ... well I don't think anybody's ever heard of and a book which was a Kickstarter project\nRight um which kind of did the same thing with you a topic that I did on this topic starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking about ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archived articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two\nGreat stuff packed into here we're going to take a short break and come back and sometime in the next hour all open up the phone lines you can join the conversation from big foot to little feet here taking us into the break with a song from waiting for Columbus [noise]\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the breed our radio and I check out our blog tire radio resentment inside a studio featuring a brand new episode with the legendary\nSir Paul McCartney no I'm In St Paul down with Joe leaving to talk about his new album Egypt Asian and of course some discussion about a little band called the ... we were ... when we were playing music or radio present in the studio check it out\nThere are over nine billion automobiles raised on farms and ranches across the country\nFor far too long those animals were not a forty protection when shutters long term\n[noise]\n\n\nThey ... you know looking back at your your original book the Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people I'm just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a third of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to to find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film I and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings of and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did with ah again one film and wanting Harvey has the ability yet if let's say somebody goes in to a bank\nThe bank has a beard on have had on and they're caught on camera leaving Harvey have this innate ability to take the deer off the face seeking the with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given one bite at its in tribal decry and it doesn't it it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean do you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences I sometimes will take a variety of photos uh Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine uh people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different human look they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you're a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble uh they can't all look like that you know from its because we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited ... worked in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association\nFire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big what that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on it for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you\nKnow there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as you know I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nThe UFO diehards uh like it even less they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can't ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge cheer for anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely\nMale and goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me\nTurn around get back on the horse or get back on my ATV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property or how got their\nSo called dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries\nAnd different kinds of groups um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives\nAre in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and I got two hundred and fifty pound gear native guy could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book\nIn a moment we'll open up the phone lines are

I thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so yeah they a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very tight and project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over a two story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive to get this email from this young filmmaker going there and let it well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm being on the Annapolis storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a part of the theory that if they stick to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can stand rather\nThat we only the mini series on\nBut so you're going in the right stuff while she and it's the same writer I don't know how to write so very family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am and maybe a veteran who didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonthly finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four and um and then when we did it like a project tickets and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the that did people had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent demanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nUh I'll tell you you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing a craft from uh the ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... ... ... ... ... and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know is that she with the facts if at the battle of half an hour where your father drove\nA wrong and craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the actual invasion came on the shore of environment and during that time and march the first time\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives your piecing them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back and land on union apple story because really the man uh before I get passionate or just to to you know circle back to ... and the men who\nMarry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert a major name Robert burning and spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they hear the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb\nUh on the continent of Europe\nSo once that much and then burn and carry components of little boy in island\nUm status final breathing yet or a year and conflict and so in writing the book we try to pull back Atlanta can bring in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hash amount over had ever hear the dough and tell me it's got ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do store where you have to recognize it even the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of your content and fiction and doing well\nI'll tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes down\nAnd now the hard radio we can sports time capsules\nHey tell us

Vincent interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander hush amount of as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm\nMeaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use ... um\nWell it was it and then more sort that he's had wished after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commander had him at a point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was a commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors ask for radar and more technology for his that marine because that makes them or you didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts\nUm the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and by the name of John Ralston he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lure of the sharks and and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they're having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen\nRap between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nWere four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was a veil\nOf all was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day in they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how their God that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the those are and the tea hydration itself with perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then other when you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ...\nAnd bought that food for blood cells ...\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it without a site all the sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it it sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yet the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer the Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and to what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right back\nTo more about tonight just log on to go to ... am dot com\n\n[noise] those\nWe have so\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the ... her radio I'm\nSorry I'll do is walk her radio ... in the studio during a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney no I'm In ... to ... film with Joe leaving just talking about his new album Egypt Tunisia and then of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles refused when we were\nPlaying music or your radio present in the studio check it out\nYou\nKnow be hard radio we can sports time\nCapsules hey so sports fans Danny west and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history\nA certain way back in Eighteen fifty seven where the world's first soccer club or football club Sheffield that seemed founded in England this week in Nineteen Twenty one of the Green Bay Packers only their first initial\nThis news news radio five eighty or Ninety four point nine ... double duty A.
