inviting me always a pleasure hobby Ben I'm pretty good pretty good keeping busy when we go in the march\nDramatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people were helpless uh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott margin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you

in the Nineteen eighties and\nI can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade that's a lot okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the ah\nAnd if you warmed to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been ... and it would out gas and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in\nThose particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um but yes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of plane to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nThe Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back\nWell most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space\nWatch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise] um\nAnd because you know the Russian government is basically organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and the the and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on the coast to coast day um\nI don't know ... or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com\n\n\n\n\n[laughter] they October twenty third what's new today on the free our radio our heart radio\nIn white

out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] [noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is about where the\nUs was around Nineteen sixty seven\n[noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they didn't want a small space station which we could not having\nThem do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law that they cannot have a government at simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh solely who once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity\nA if you're going to be a first class power but it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason\nIs a ... in a certain I mean the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization is doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to watch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] [noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons uh the um [noise] you know I'm\nA less where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the one weapons okay\nI mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it frankly easier to get rich that to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um\nYou know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich and rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiff talk to go\nAnd um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to us\nFly on airplanes you know do [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds or they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who me a ... you know knocking on Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets\nI'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert leery in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the light as though it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone until your life do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead Rob a okay\nAll right ah well here's the thing um [noise] there there isn't\nIntelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong with this you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would\nNot undo the settlement of America but\nOn Mars there are new Indians there are no buys in\nHurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that\nIf we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions are being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because\nOf mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance mine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nIf you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not [noise] um but\nUm\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but\nCertainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up your questions there and the

... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author purists psychologist resigning in the north eastern section of while\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity and grossly donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years Syria's with his work all the studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this will come to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghosts and fair psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so I actually I actually got a day job and then I studied a pair of psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way it's not very well [laughter]\nWell that's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um you know I uh\nI have a degree in Perry psychology a when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically ... the environmental sensitivity and goes land counters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with it goes studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these\nThrowing encounters um it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several first hand account of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes all the conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's when I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's where I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening I'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them what do they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes so that's um inside it's basically um telepathy\nExtra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that\nA lot of goes lane counters that happen out there um the base of it\nHas to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and ghostly encounters\nA so I really think that um people's collapse of the ... is a real it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty\nThing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this drama I think it\nIt it sort of\nA lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we\nProbably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left\nAnd there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that right and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent\nI'm a ... Patrick distressing they'll thing ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions um there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour\nI think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience um and some people perceive it it's good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might not the same experience to be terrified the way the negative and then kind of you go toward more demonic part of thing\nSo I I really enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience of research experience and I don't try to put the seemingly on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked up at coast to coast am dot com results show on Facebook\nAnd Twitter as well we got those links for you to the coast to coast damn dot com [noise] we're gonna come back in a moment continue chatting with him about his book of course we'd go studies done in our final law were the night we'll take your phone calls with him right here on coast to coast am\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coastal zone newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd why young people are listening to such angry music and this week in two thousand three in the middle of their first world tour and flush with fame from their debut album ... founder Ben Moody abruptly quit the band\n\nAnd now look back we can history\nThis week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named Annie medicines Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel with the help of two assistance Taylor strapped herself into a letter harness inside an old wouldn't heckle barrel five feet high and three feet in diameter\nKnock vinyl speaking engagements Taylor same\nCool and she was unable to make the fortunes for which she had hopes this week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule viewer governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River\nFour thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world at the time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City one year later it a carry five million cars from New York to New Jersey and back again\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two in a televised speech of extraordinary gravity president John F.

Brendan because the person who died comes back never had someone tune as business had they had the tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these motions happening um so you know the body sort of\nDo the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exists the memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things I the research out there really says that\nI think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps\nThese bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and\nThat could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of a survivor you know final goodbye from the disease could help move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards revolution and I and when I talked to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one after\nAnother big on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes to counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's not all negative and demons things like\nA brand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about though\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise]\nYou know something narrow biological is different about them when they put them there's there are some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design um you know where they're actually doing them our eyes jeeze and what they're finding their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting\nTo this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but we all we all experience differently right and they've shown that throughout All right as
