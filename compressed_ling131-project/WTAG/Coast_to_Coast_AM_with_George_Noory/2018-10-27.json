book that I think you will love hearing the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange\nCloud on Mars and\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place\nIn America and uh and when cameras\nCaptured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment that coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give you a heads up on it because I Love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City here or there it's just like at least that's the theory behind paranormal activity\nWitnessed that science hero trees a candidate dispensary now behold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it I feel capitals\nPositive here for new we'll just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to come\nAnd look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencil I I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to\nCoast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked at a at\nA later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in the elite group of science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing terrific come in\nBut you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she left to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she is very I Love it\nYou know she's great and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic\nApproach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter\nBut looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer in cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life ... eye and say try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America corny corny Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've got to cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his at\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most ...\nIn part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicks that can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the ... there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut do we how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real uh in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's\nGoing on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nKnow opine about this I Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe our perfect based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet\nSeries you know the facts ma'am right Andrew\n... that's what I did with the sports section is there more than a thousand but now that you can imagine\nOh no ... I've read through to you you're very young you know very thorough yup\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise]\nUm I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at the threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into wisdom and Buddhism and a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter]\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I like the ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my age very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book\nThat I think um we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ditch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list [noise] next on coast to coast am ... on it [noise]\n[noise] um\nAnd now the heart radio we can sport time capsule hay fell a sports fans are Danny west that um you're\nGiven a ... ...\n... ... how far\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nBused coast to coast am [noise] would be in front of\nYou know almost and [laughter] and the numbers get really too\nBy the way that

show on demand from the train 'em for those who loved true crime this great but it it's more than that it's history and it just read from a a guy who's been a long time tracking the story of America's most elusive serial killer\nIt's a chill or for Halloween weekend and you don't want to miss ed coming up tomorrow night but what some which given me goose bumps tonight is\nThe list for Michael Guillen what are the things that science is on the threshold of doing that he might recommend to get as a science reporter the end of life as we know it next on coast to coast am Disney infinite\nBoy

this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow\nWere to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice to you and I was not nice do Mother Nature\nOf on yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for that exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a\nPrice and he can't do that you're you're you're\nFighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back ... quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we\nGoing to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to Hoover and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang goal which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e and I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\n'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once boasted about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... it just buttoned up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know\nTen thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nAnd I think the interesting these are the two is ... ...\nThe equation is with you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the ... with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our lights as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael Guillen last shoot you the number is coming up and

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or they lost their ability to walk in the pitch minor injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\n... humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement called the trans human movement where\nAs you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that they use a ... a trend human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms zap them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have right now these are these are arms that\nHe can move with it they're they're they're wired is\nMine and I and I said to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in a military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there you know where you know write it get it get it you know so so or soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what a fifty fifty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons\nI I think that the I\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nMaybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nI mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm in ...\nBelieve that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit it maybe the science fiction part of me then I see that\nPoliticians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now in another escalating arms race right you know ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same\nYou know all our faults in our foibles\nAnd our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ...\nAnd yet I Would propose to you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the\nLaw of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses\nBut but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween you kind of moments right there were like All right no there is this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and\nThere's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAgain I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it\nIn a few but but that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch that they were able to monitor his apple watch and record\nHis torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe it there in the Saudi consulate they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that's going to be published very shortly\nI'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThat kind of a ... year treasury rate or your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show key thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was\nClaiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a they watch [noise]\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the mystery\nThe end of life as we know it Michael Guillen next coast to coast am in for George ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense\nRight Kenya right\nAfter you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is the end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah\nYeah it'll give it a little plug up [laughter] I think you you\nWere talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the the\nI don't come down and in in them up and are they talking about this theory that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know it does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd soul yawn ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running\nOn on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nThink that the war from saying or for the crush souls\nOf the people in the dumps on an ... you know getting ... getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like try and everything stop\nYou know the ... a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six\nSo Jack Lew that actor those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more\nConversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast saying David\nYeah hey my question for me I'm an extent ball and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and if they do we just leave them and we\nJust lost a a no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh I've been on it kicking machine going on forty five\nYears yes er here and I was a banker degeneration I'd like you know from your guest or when we feel that the shoe will\nBe overcome through CRISPR or a ... a ... either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these same era\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael deal in the book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and uh for your joints spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this is the infant

I Hope you went to coast to coast am dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar it'd be didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nIn downtown Oregon City here are very different at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that science erode trees a candidate to Spencer eat less than having now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nI see what's happening and I thought like somebody was standing there like somebody who is like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that does happen then Andy remembered the surveillance hand like we saw this I\nNot long after that this happened watch the pen cap it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law that they set aside many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a form of ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a candidate shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it as he wasn't jumping on open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get started Mike\nAnything good morning hours y'all\n[laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills right in the road with the blood of our children\n[laughter] yes well anyway and right now right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in the Eighteenth inning for this game's World Series you know the question of whether this show ends before that game and where do you want to take

download mannerism can download actions\nMatch by robots now but it all\nGang because you can't quote stole some ... and the feelings and the personality of the callers I I'm with you hear it I mean we're the incident in\nThe Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's growing up I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with ya in theory well I'm with you in theology young school um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I and world power guys first of all for not listening for five years I don't want to get too much into it but um after last night I have a couple of things to say on\nThis whole in March ... he ...\nHer saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of things he could've kept it survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people story not first survival situations and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are\nYou know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for that families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple\nMultiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if the supplies which says ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt for the oil like two I'm falling scare myself\nNot to consume companies supplies\nBut just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis than themselves\nAnd interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up in these codes or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do\nBut to her point I was watching on Netflix\nA there's a series called uh like the men with three wives who were three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid a\nDone is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am\nDone rather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your commercial buffet ghost in the pawn shop in the court that was their name was Andy Gomez remember ... for the monster yeah\nSure loved them at all of them you

I'm always thinking along spiritual line here with the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I experience who already very seriously I'm interested in my book called the ... river Jesus\nYeah I'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published and or like you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the production of ... it was kind of transcribe not written transcribe by Levi Dowling transcribe it from a classic record\nFor no offers on has gone for book of remember is another way of putting it [laughter]\nNative with this book because it gets her wealth in many ways for for gospel um and in describing the life of Jesus and also covers like that so called missing years of his life\nOr the harlot ... ... years or so [laughter] um but it does talk about the different ages and that the the full of full title of the book is very clear and gospel of Jesus karma the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm not I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ and I'm not a lot of conservative Christian among or both\nI'm more in line with the Quakers and I've been with the idea of um the beginning of their age and when they get the current age began disagreement about\nThat as well yeah ours is that I'm going to determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or\nIn this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I ... I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years um because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those were the only one I'm familiar with a cover it right here\nI'm a good wanted a wrap it up quickly on a lot of could go ask you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with different color you are talking about why a lot of life is\nIt your your creative freedom we have a we we all worship something you know what the money or her metabolism or whether it's got him or her so um that we really appreciate our freedom is just that you should stay there for you to worship your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that as a sure I did it because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have a buddy ... individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political you're I I think what holds us together as a country is a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about it the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and or write or soon to be a a a cans and it's an ... didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for jumping\nIn an open lines and look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nLet them make that decision I Want to think a George ...

this might be a little bit different in terms of this has nothing to do with the players like if you're thinking to yourself I don't want to watch the red Sox anymore 'cause their owner is you know X Y and Z that's fine but I Will say that I don't think this has anything to do with a\nMonkey bats and David Price and Chris Sale and all the other oh no on the team that have gotten them to this point you know so it is to me important to separate the two and you know you can still tell John Henry I feel about him but still be able to watch the\nGame and oh no no no no no right right I'm not I'm not turning away from the game this is not this is about actually the owners and hey don't get me wrong I I'm Upset with the ...\nNot saying hey guess what guys stand up you know ... and ... and then do a little too little too late over the summer\nThey put the new rule in but no this is was John Henry like this is a kind of anger that people had with um [noise] uh you know the\nYankees organization under George Steinbrenner [noise] no but no kidding aside no but I mean really like they love their Yankees but they would be mad at Steinbrenner for the things he would do right\nHow come you ... like you to Cal zone right in his office no how 'bout how come you traded Jay mute [laughter] get\nTogether and I'm like oh you don't know what the hell you're doing\nThat's a Seinfeld folks but no but that kind of stopped for a member when George\nWas being interviewed for the job of the Yankees any insulted Steinbrenner how he said you have taken our our beloved Yankees and made them into a laughing stock you know offer the glorification of your massive EEO\nHire this ma'am [laughter] ah but that's what that's what it is hey I've written\nStuff about John Henry before and you know I think he's full bowl but you know this is really this was this was\nThis was putting politics and where it didn't need to be I Want to see that team\nUm\nHe didn't\nOn the game of baseball it's not like Pete Rose this is different it was politics he did nothing bad any Red Sox you know from anything you could call he did controversial came post retirement post ... ... exactly but we don't want him\nThere we don't like how it looks well you know what it looks pretty bad you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space\n... from her office in our proposal from road rebel for

this vital funding and thankful to our team of local state federal and nonprofit partners who brought this vision to life OK let's just quickly go through what's wrong completely wrong with everything he said there\n'cause I'll use his own logic to against them okay for every dollar we invest in head start our country realizes nine dollars in benefits through increased earnings and decrease reliance on safety net programs well if that's true\nIf we can get a nine hundred percent return on our investment\nCan we put a trillion dollars into head start\nI mean if I came to you and said I've got an investment here and you ... you're going to get you're going to make nine hundred percent on your money when you be a fool not to invest or well wait a minute [laughter] who would be the fool because when you say\nA gym that doesn't make any sense how am I going to make nine hundred percent on this\nHe's saying just like man this is the common refrain Nancy Pelosi said remember when she talked about food stamps and welfare\nHow much economic for every dollar spent on food stamps I don't know what the government gets like three to four or five dollars back really\nThat doesn't make any sense how can you hear something like that and then say oh that's great that's like in Nineteen eighty four the the the story Nineteen eighty four by George Orwell tell people that and tell them that it's great and they just don't use any logic to think about it one other thing in this\nThe typical McGovern typical Richie Neal he says headstart as one of the best programs we have for breaking the cycle of poverty\nNo it isn't\nNo no see it is not you know one head start is\nHead start is this\nYou created the welfare state with the great society with Johnson\nAnd so you made families less and less responsible for their own children you even incentivized\nFathers to be absentee going to break up the family\nAnd now this is your fix for it right\nAnd let's talk about breaking the cycle of poverty Jim McGovern you opposed\nThe program at the worst or housing authority developed by re Mariano a fellow Democrat someone who grew up in public housing you opposed his program that was voluntary that helped to get people out of public housing\nThat\nAs long as they went to work and their kids went to school they could stay in public housing and money would be saved for them but if they didn't do that they were out new said I Can't participate in the program that tosses people out of public housing well then watch the incentive to leave public housing\nSo don't put out a press release with your friends from that community action council and talking about how this is a this is going to break the cycle of poverty where all that this does is contributes to what perpetuates the cycle of poverty [noise]\nYou're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space\nTime for my gas to get the recognition they deserve for their role influencing pop culture and public opinion
