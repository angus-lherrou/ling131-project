I mean you talk about actual killing someone needs to kill cabin all a Minnesota Public school teacher put out a tweet Monday that someone needs to take one for the team quote in killed Kevin all\nYeah and I'm I'm reading this and I and there's no pro stations the mainstream media\nYour book points out ... ... on page thirty nine now to Nineteen forty seven alone and estimated eight thousand members of the ss safely traveled a candidate in the United states utilizing false documents\nAnd that ... and that their claws Barbie one of the worst the worst in France was actually paying a pension by our own CIA so explain to the twenty Eighteen mine how does the United states government the red cross the Vatican since\nThese mass murders that go free and how do we take our tax money and pay someone like horsepower me like I Seventeen hundred dollars a month how do we do that\n[noise] you know it's again people who\nDon't confront evil one of the great stories in the book is a woman named Alfred E.\nH. E. T. H. as a young woman she was a seamstress alright World War two broke out and they'll ... signs up for the lady S. S. core she was assigned or ravens a concentration camp north or Berlin\nWhich was a women's concentration camp Jewish women a gypsy women uh dissidents that kind of thing\nAnd al ... a German Shepherd and terrorize these women for four years what happened to her she came to the United states on a refugee visa you know nobody knew that she was a scar I moved to San Francisco marries a Jew\nStays in San Francisco for almost fifty years before the state department tracked her down and the portrait of Germany she still alive in Germany getting every month\nUs Social Security check it's impossible it's impossible it happens because people don't engage\nThey don't fight it they don't bring it to the attention of people that might matter and you know if you ... and this Donald Trump\nSituation uh once he was elected all the rooms in the media changed says you know ... I no longer was the truth and poor did was get him\nBecause we don't like him so all of our resources are going to be directed to getting him ... progressive movement is capitalized on that has exploited that and has walked into precincts where they got me\nYeah the same people set accused me accused Kavanaugh same tax sure right same crew\nBut no Americans are they don't know what's happening or if they do they're looking away to Kobe or lose one view or no because of that no I don't think so no\nAnd something happening now you know you have ... show the I guess in Saudi Arabia and dissident who has said nasty things and ... is a contributor to the Washington Post but a ... is a Saudi Arabian citizen seemingly he is killed in Turkey which it shouldn't happen\nAnd but the media the last couple three days has been all over Trump because they want Trump to do something about an individual murder of a Saudi Arabian citizen that happened in Turkey as if Trump's responsible I ... I mean I'm driving me nuts I mean what can Trump do\nAnd it's even worse because Trump has succeeded in getting the pasture right All right who is held in prison unjustly by the Turks out but you don't hear that\nNo no no that's not a story you\nKnow the the fixes and\nEverybody knows any intelligent person knows the fixes and then you can't count on the major\nMedia outlets to report the truth or even ... not even close so\nThat's evil in a in a country that depends on an electorate being informed\nWith accurate information again ah you know I I wrote a killing the ss to highlight the fact that this can happen here\nYou know one of the first things that Hitler did was he eliminated the free press yeah All right uh his goons a in a intimidated them and if they didn't play ball they wound up in a concentration camp [noise]\nSo yeah we have a free press here but we don't have an honest press anymore\nYou know bill I said do a national correspondent on a week ago if you would take NBC CBS and ABC throwing CNN if say CBS would make a conscious decision to objectively and in a conservative way report the news and stand out\nUm between ABC and NBC I think there's great success for one of the national networks\nTo change the course of their own quit doing Ninety four percent of negative stories about Trump\nTo be more objective and coverage about what's going on wanting to make economic sense for CBS or NBC they won't do it but it ABC to make a conscious decision to be objective and the cover news in a way that it's fifty fifty and balance why don't want to them why why didn't want him do it for economic reasons\nBecause the culture of the people who run those organizations right up to the top is liberal oh no question though\nBob either running Disney um uh the guys in Philadelphia and Comcast [noise] um the CBS people ah they're all foreigners and if they didn't told that line their social lives we change\nOr they wouldn't be look if you're a Robert ... part of the thrill of running Disney is that you get invited to every\nParty and Hollywood you're\nYou're a big shot you walk in and they're all the movie stars [noise] um you know being a oh Bob Irish here well if you ran a a an organization a news organization that was actually there too conservative and\nToday I think are tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better so I'm an interview and in a few minutes\nThe president also extremely complimentary things to say about me for which I'm ... and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity and my\nFriend Sean Compton [noise] and then also their friendship with the president [noise] uh I'm not sure he would have invited me to [noise] to meet with him on friday night and a couple of nights ago and I also told you asked me what I thought how I thought he was doing in the mid west so\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] first of all\nYou have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships I had swept in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job restrict set up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of fighting and I garden that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage ... everything's on what's going to happen with the mega housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen sending\nUs to talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is he's a great religious leader and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do but we got him\nBack here we got back I we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got them back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big wall coming up you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now about\nYour wife who's good she had to Africa sure which was unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and and the other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that costs Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal and we're also the\nPiggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told them look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused\nSo we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deal you know improved\nI Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise] it was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so we're\nFriends how many jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent ... people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union is pretty brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nThis audio is for your

happen a more frequently you over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage\nIt imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be there will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen\nAnd then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by\nThe state Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run\nAnd I can dent in twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I\nWe wouldn't have any of that stuff going on and so that's why three weeks in a day for now is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a\nIf you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races\nThat will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate just think about two to six years\nEver having no federal judge has confirmed anywhere\nIf the Democratic party takes the U.S Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president digging anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if\nThe Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we're going through the past two years to fight cholesterol and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs saying the ss drunk and you know it and I know and\nSo if you're in one of those a contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America or black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ...\nThanks for listening and I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond and so can I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham\nWill do my thanks for listening tonight and sleep I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contests that house districts are one of these great Senate races please go out and vote to goes to the future of this country is still coming out the great American [noise] live with you and the president [noise] some [noise]\n\nMethod ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top

... and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dreams download briefly before we started to move forward and end the dreams developed a most of the poor\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert boxing just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get dinner bought every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten\nA originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... bother jump off of all and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating the sticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of half has it has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you would you just you know simple mindedly I thought each step they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their pyramids with uh something called they called they said that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which Jimmy I Want it to correct something I said in the fate to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't an arcade into big tipper\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the

everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six she has tried three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers ... with a cut away showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery and so working from the bottom the first layer up\nA which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing and you're right I'm I'm I'm a listing all the ... you know the total number of pixels twenty three some of these peaks a worst civically noted by petri\nTo half surface ratios that were round number fractious of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings are of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have it seems to be a coronation thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number ... of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and but nevertheless also see these type of round fractious of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not and\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away\nYeah you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there is supposed to be nothing\nRight well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words it's associate with are feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course on the twenty four also has a round fractional twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round facts of the twenty fifth and they're not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers insight that the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here\nUm that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted tower but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be\nA you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... that the voice I got it yes yes of course we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a raft guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go back leads happy not an accident\nNo within references of course with the lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nL O ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say\nYou know go ahead Barry it's yours go back great Cathy\nYou like that do you like to the area okay\nA day or I always love hearing is that all that it may have more do you place great for me they gave the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their armored collar just at the end\nUm and and yes it's a this was in the ... so to medical all just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long or it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm at this ... I Believe tapes to the middle kingdom and and to reach us back a most likely a probably to him or temps time so um if they were they were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly fanatic um and the evidence from that comes from ... a king scorpions\nAnd that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt or probably from Bhutto and bookstores are sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with the with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you know what's the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds the Greeks adapting the etymology a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before comfort game I think there was a we would think it was the lioness and her name was Mickey and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or did you\nTake a break

just seems to me that you could\nIn architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a remote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\n... yes and as as a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked\n'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there's something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nI'm a new alien um they are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with a number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\n... one more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west\nTo Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question

researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer on the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with ...\nRegarding talked about so

doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that there are they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted um\nYou know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do well\nDo you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah how was she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors\nThat reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved a African force at by a it's input\nUm you know I think they're sort of mixed back here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it at you know some of the projects that uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being safe in political right now and I I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that is why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal yeah\nSo it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot that it was Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed or they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA fair they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to

the great pyramid isn't coated in the ... of any new\nUh numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I've talked about\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think that's the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America\nThat carried the same traits as the ... trade meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah uh I I\nAssume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological uh within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the traits I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it well\nLet me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n[noise] [noise] yeah well I think so I think that could be so that could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off of our has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter off that fear is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know\nHow you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at\nThe very top I acting so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be\nMaybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by eight and hide I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new ones can show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gun to bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and fire investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any effort excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know the Jeff to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you were saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to things and ... that's a kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is
