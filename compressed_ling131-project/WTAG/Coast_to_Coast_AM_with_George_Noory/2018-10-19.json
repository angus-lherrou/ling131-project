is white tonight the argument that we're making Chris Jewish Riggio her on the program the like the argument the argument we're making is that we live in the matrix\nAnd the reason why is because in PCs non playing characters are easily programmed organics the ones that are that they use a but I'd say critical analysis of the ones that will not be program and they are the ones\nThat are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Chris geo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program in the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House in what I saw was the dissolve meant of the left's agenda\n'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this broadband the N word but it\nIt goes a yes and it goes to show how the script all of a sudden changed a lot\nOf you ... did you see the the the there was a traffic it was being blocked in Portland\nThe anti five members were blocking and directing traffic world guy pulls up at a car\nAnd some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like a Whitey I bet you're a Whitey aren't you and he says to I'm going to go in this guy's a white guy calling another guy a Whitey say with what happened was ... we have a a a black faceless and PC\nOn CNN calling Kanye n n word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with so you were talking about numbers and numbers so symbolism\nAnd a numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to mom\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to\nPoint out that parents and they can actually called me and this was before this is like not in Nineteen Ninety this is ten Twenty years before this time that we're in right now he's he called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see if that will replicate just like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the organism that society and the leading his idea that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy and I believe these names are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means\nIt's that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are full of them in and constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic ways very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like ... ah there's a ... a mind form that is that when you manifested becomes an ... which is of course another coal concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind making a thought form that becomes autonomous kind of like slender man okay\nI I Would say that ... kind of an ...

this this egg records that serving a master whichever the master the creator is is actually influencing these girls to go and kill something\nSo that's what you got you got a a mean you have a toll but you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow into become either monsters or or to serve in\nAnd once again the ... the hunk ... says the same thing and what is the un PC me it is the bald the you know ... basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it really it's it's one of those start changing devices that that as a result it's the backlash\nAgainst this these autonomy and that means auto autonomous I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomy thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all this is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and if that's what makes them so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really do change people's minds you know really quick way\nWell this is even more ancient magic let's go back to the Jews okay let's go back to ... what was going but he was a\nA it was an animated anthropomorphic being made of clay that was there to protect it was a monster that was created to protect the Jews pretty much it was there to protect the children to Prague and and so they created this\nThis this creature out of clay\nOr he was harmless to to ah those he was a made for but he would attack those who were trying to attack them and and so this is the same principles the idea of creating\nAn Internet column creating an Internet amongst us an Internet tool or an Internet Edgar Gore if people you know they don't understand the meanings have means means are certainly like this they are the thought forms that when when they are unleashed\nThey can cause trouble they can call it causes ill will once again goes back to what Chris has been saying is is if it's so easy to create a ... if it's so easy to create an\nAnswer ... perfect form that is illustrating a programmed a ... if you will\nThan we know that we live in a matrix we live in a programmable world\nThat the that they're it's getting easier to program because people are becoming more susceptible and not dealing with plane consciousness they're not dealing with a movie called primitive consciousness the idea that they can either feel or understand anything at all and I think this is the confusing part is because people are getting so confused now\nThat they're reaching a point where they can't even find you know simple\nConsciousness they have to seek it out elsewhere Christian a tree deal with the sit on the ground zero fascinating discussion and I [noise] Tripoli six seven three thirty seven

down the venture off the surface of it moving over or how slowly headed for a row of trees and within thirty seconds or a minute it just disappeared from her said\nYes she did hear a home and that

I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving the reading\nAny questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe iron ore yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers who are others who are critical of him say that he's just a great\nMagician in and I told him I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal\nI Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] try to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know was I was really good at that but you know I dabble with a lot of body experience when I was eleven which really I think Steve me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce\n[laughter] yes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical\nAnd you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent and those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking it's so restrictive and limiting no into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond let's\nAll move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah\nOther um financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be in growing in a consciousness so they're kind of a digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday ... and a first name possible short they're asking\nAbout I'm a soul mate I Do a lot about love and romance\nAnd try to keep each call two minute nap for so she came out with his son when he\nWill cut it short will try to get right in there as quickly as you believe in reincarnation [noise]\nI don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have if we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because\nThey've been in other dimensions other planets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation and have to say yes a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're related disorders\nAs a psychic or anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhat you said very strange about like um\nAre you are you picking up\nFeelings or anything like that\nWell I don't like going to the cemetery I I don't like the energy there and people who are dropped one and they go to the cemetery frequently Boeing that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves\nAnd yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief\nBut you don't dwell on it you say you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to relieve them and\nAnd I always think about though right he was and\nThink about that we can wish the wealth of going from like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had to go there and let them go I'm going to the cemetery very bad you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as I was growing up is that a good work [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that went to the cemetery a lot you know and I found myself cemetery great you're growing up and at one point in my parents were pointing to a Marshall am driving through Greenwich cemetery and my mom to think we should get one of those\nOh and I think it's time yeah I think it dries out I really don't want to live here don't play no they're not going to stay here\nAs I started crying and I said what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my

the colors and the shape of very very important George so again the artist you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the a K C story where he was getting on an elevator yes he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any or is it scared the heck out of bill how does he didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamp and the people died\nYeah you gotta love Casey [laughter] oh my God [laughter] absolutely George Norris reminder as a psychic\nWhere do you get your I'll call the power where'd you get it from\nI don't think it's powered I oh God that we're really trying to think a lot of people say that and I think only God as the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I try to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath\nSo the energy for us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals Joyce and many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know how when my cat died or we felt close they came to me that night and he said you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and the little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I passed but I'm okay now I don't feel crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have are really as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI don't want people to think the two sides it right is supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know a suicide they're all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\nGeorge Burns\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or Joyce I Do have that ability as\nA feeling of this class and hand you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel presses or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive so if you're with the person who is not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who what I call psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have a ... dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... the year and then I just want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great however you run a charge that\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris or the born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so ... ten sixteen so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris\nOh I'm very much a creature routine and I just wanted to see if their routines and our break his routine can get boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and uh do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\n[noise] um I'm used to I Do some writing now\nYes well you have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up details when you paint you should be painting again that's very therapeutic the press and that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well\nSo you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough now in ... so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it did you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nTime on science groups in Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know what sometimes can become really really discouraged and you say they have to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want to do like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy and so on and change your life and try prayer and meditation they know what God I'm really stuck and bring me something fresh and something no an spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but what the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic for anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up [laughter] to me I Hope it's twenty four seven lines so you can call in\nTo the day was got a question for you in Canada and the

her she's saying look I'm Dave I'm fine\nYou know Jewish we're not going to escape\nThat that'll that'll probably not\nGoing to happen to all of us hopefully later sooner [laughter] what a user or anything people can do to kind of mentally prepare themselves for this ... this trip yes\nDon't be afraid and know that you're never alone even if you go through the tunnel that follows the physical death even then you're not alone you have always you always have an angel or a guide with you and then when you cross over to the other side it's fabulous\nYou created by people you know it's a big

look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't

dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field of

maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back eventually opt as seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my co dissociation\nWas an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I was a former loan me a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nBecoming sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the old bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members around says there's a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about connections with\nDrama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience this power that dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream if they believe the dreams put you in touch with the ... if you like but\nYou can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest\nSo we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be a ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a death on a more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in\nIndigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dreams sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that I began to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit in Paris how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes you get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits of pots and that is out of the lead also the rushed to sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs don't deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's good times and Bachmann loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and said no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nWhat about the ability to chime traveled in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know it or not they do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival I'm dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those like what is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams show us\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead they ... we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life that could save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know to show that I have that I have avoided death on the road tree dates with death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecasts but it's happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to fall on the other side of a\nBlind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact you understand what our relationship with time is through dreaming we\nHave to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power like this come very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power of the life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations that people in far flung places feel proud of you know multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we have

outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind and that are there are always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen the fault of the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts to something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and\nThere's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is though they're going to\nHave you lived in pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger says she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place\nAnd the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific proof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms be says but I couldn't possibly reporter people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of lose the dreaming you call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out loose or the state lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance and adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's grandma or someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dreamy another example is and I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try\nLike state treated sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images that rise and fall of the what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the porch off elusive dreaming and finally\nActive premium the method is all about treating with your eyes wide open we ... how to look for the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and so misleading I think that I've been on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret it might have to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things and the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find the behind something that's scaring worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of how that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick
