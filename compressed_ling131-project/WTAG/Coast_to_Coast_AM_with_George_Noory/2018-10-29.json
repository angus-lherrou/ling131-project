and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in this article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organized done by political agitator as an activist\nWho are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place\nAnd said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political agitator than the activist who got this together explained that the major media will do it\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill ah Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt\nA you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work but others are MS Thirteen\nA gang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a\nEast Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their meals are suddenly appearing pets are suddenly appearing medical care is certainly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is

states and let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election in your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explain why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the

they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nUh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably to Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by\nLeftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nIs embarrassing him because on balance because it was

some great stories in the book of the most ... monster book um and at some of them like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard band as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the winged man it's a story from staffordshire England and\nThat was nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid\nSo I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a wood Lin ...\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post\nAnd somebody had same this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use\nOver the woods a at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out to point platforms\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which is already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI'm I think for that reason um you know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do it is to sort of look at the day to and and ... and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say I mean if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them\nYou know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility um\nYou know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon which I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\n[noise] well yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was the fact\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four and Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and how the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks like ... ...\nAnd I'm I'm for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big news in that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year then the men in black\nAnd and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place uh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on this phenomena foreign demand in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say I'm a you know nothing like\nThe the concept in the movies I typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live\nWhite white um um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its um but\nThere's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe the ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nPretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... nations you know you go they really weird lungs and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain\nThe recent powerless with demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for their might be but I think it's a very small cats agree\nThey really unexplained and the way it would I think none of it and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the agency is my actually unemployed elections in black cover their tracks in other words it might be able to think of him anyway but I don't know what it does\nFrom using as a main quiet\nMay not want to I've been talking about the government you know the men in black really are and I don't like to\nDo that sort of lead us into where we're heading into the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that next latest book\nOr whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls open on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government government's very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... she was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive and it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as they the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow Jake what's\nIntriguing is that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they the they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of by this encounter with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful ... sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realized that the government use really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA sciences studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that sold in huge Vegas gigantic numbers of books with salt\nUm and I have a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file honor dams skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone yes talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm\n[noise] ... crossing candy theme\nGame like no don't miss out on

like violent big foot type creatures attacked and killed them\nOr you have sort of Russian military experiments UFO activity and despite all the research and the top of several books are being written on the subject there's no sort of one hundred percent consensus on on what actually happened it's it remains\nYou know ... but there are a lot of weight aspects to the story which I guess unfortunate

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we ... we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states have consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this is a movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents even and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how of belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... ah around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remained strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America um believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the option a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people get in that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real yeah I'm kind of like a science nerd and an offense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these and half the scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with offensive on mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for new spiritual infection and I and I um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to normally charges\n[laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of ... reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think ...\nYou know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and um it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for um for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to have\nA another demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's length with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth of mentioned um since Einstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science\nI spoke about this but some of the people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional object that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seemed simpler and more elegant um um and so on so and in fact justice skip forward to today\nToday you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you\nStill have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members every audience of her string theory\nWith this for a flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that by his readers ... from the readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye because their reality so he sort of got\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I met a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox but but the square character did have these wild Boston and even at the visionary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about\nOther world spirituality and the search for invisible

S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a lot\nOf that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experienced time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm done and\nI was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYou're right you're right it lays it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that you know the facts\nFuture moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more positive or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming sell it somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know using a bit of on time here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last for their um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he got everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and you also believe that every one if they haven't got the journal by their bed or their dreams and all he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together [noise] well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're\nGoing to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences\nOr to talk about the science is a sharman remote viewers\nOut some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before white fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David great sail away to listen to the break\n[noise] no you can get show updates and connect with other coast fans would you joined the ...
