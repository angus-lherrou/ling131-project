I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility not only protect myself but anybody that night and it might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to\nAh I live in Texas still allowed to in many places but at the same time they are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to if you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is this if you're not going to allow me to carry my gun in\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever\nI mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you weren't to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there is no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that\nGuy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns but once the interview tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their\nTwelve people died so we are I think that you have to work in conjunction to synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't um or they should they should have protections to make sure

can do it in the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it in the in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so the people that we pay to be our legislators

something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously the economic a full body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just\nThat have an accent that

slightly changed the title\nUp but it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's that good so if you're looking for something\nTo be a little bit spooky more in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting appeal house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare a Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much\nAnd I think what even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in

I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which\nWere originally let out of jail and then he is kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that than you\nGo but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway that right\nI Am a nuanced the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their belief all the things you're told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know go O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October it can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and still happens their biggest one is October\nWhich will never go\nWell I really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the week that the state fair is open and I I I Would never have guessed shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now we're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round a film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want\nTo risk just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it actually around the time of year there's not that many curb but in October for instance the er the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause they're just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as you know picnic\nTable and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad\nStuff to an actual historical artifacts but that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over ... start heading to the train and start adding to your cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to shut it kept pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad though\nWhen they got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker\nOr and or Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list of things are and I have a\nGreat night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast day I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next on coast to coast am this is he in\nThree years ago making a murderer became less the TV show than a force of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal\nJustice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan nasty trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding emerge\nReminding a murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the often thought ...\nEleven counts of murder crime Del Walters Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Robin powers faces the forty six year old charred with opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this is what it sounded like on police radio\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the\nOr sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means\nStories that inflamed the sense is right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this was the same reason that looked true crime\nAnd bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something crime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice\nIt's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these\nTrue crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying\nThe root cause sham that not run for your life [noise] uh all because of a\nStory seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even

I had told my daughter\nThat ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when you commit the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and\nHe would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky and that is fresh crime happened to occur the biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable\nHow many points that first murder matches up with\nAgainst the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so are we just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this\nBut we found a\nEvidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it\nBecause it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successfully after that it\nIs is the years went forward and yet\n... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the uh I think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house\nWas shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the uh asked most of these crimes coming up next door but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they\nCome from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThere are part of everybody\nThat I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime bucks by the way the last book I read was the real prime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um [noise] ... ah I live with Weinstein I could have a last name wrong\nUh the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry\nYou know surely a his\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the ... of ... or was a an avid reader of crime stories or Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers\nTolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports to me as I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people trying to do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories as this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive

and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no can have that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime that night\n[noise] yeah they are uh I was saying that crime stories are last name to it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about you don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate thoughtful entry into the\nSubject I just got hooked like a fish uh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and all those ... called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively ... ... ... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can\nDo you consider this a a true crime book sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought well heck this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a\nA a great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime engine and he had always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nAlways believe that he had gotten away with it\nAnd he said that reading it in my book that\nIn our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it but it was it was a shy he said he was a tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow\nAt I don't know why it was important to him to go out I understand the understanding sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book them a lot of what the\nBook is about is is that all all all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is\nIs trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery or what how people live\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live or people in urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in fall to have a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible bath\nAnd also I was trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of a town or the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context to these murders\nUm you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that I looked at the party or is this man and that has to do with the the soccer in the case is taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he had a\nWitnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and an entire community um a pickle deal because critical deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done\nOn December twenty fourth because you're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a ... it's ... it's a tiny detail that you would right\nThat would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago except that it's important to them a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the railway\nTickets tickets through what happened in ...\nAn item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um a dispute between the ... city council and the power company so\nThat but ah whether what let's go now and four is not mentioned anywhere the um [noise] uh that's not an appropriate I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right yeah uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial\nTo the victim victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community uh thought well on them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them [noise] ah but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\n... where there is an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um one of his maps and trade crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and what not an adjoining how\nThe uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now\nThe people that area's still remember it still they they could show yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but at some of the squash do quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you of narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that let's go

[laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional relationships not do the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act in so they keep recreating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you saved\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to think so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that's ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime\nWas a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nIt's exactly what you're so what is saying that that's that's who he was that that's a that's how he knew himself I don't doubt that Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuse as young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he said he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative answers up here\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because\nThere is an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the of that ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried a\nThey carry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through and about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\n[noise] but it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which\nHe knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do is to whether it's just one person who is the victim of the ... range but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know um\nNurses just sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know they it's a ... thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse's there's a ... because it was not it didn't have any charm it was not it was ... ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly makes a good appearance\nHe didn't do any of that it was it was a truce hike up a psychopath have no fear ... know norm at do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this ... on the train is that from his crime that he was not\nEven not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with history so I\nThat's probably not that I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller metro train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten\nYears or Fifteen\nGoing to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nA this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research path so we moved on and part of the book but very still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a

killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about those people just driving around going up Tuesday
