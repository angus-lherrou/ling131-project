decision that we are in the last defense against an invasion force an invasion force should echo from here to the border and\nTo the heavens so there's that or this brand rather should I go from here to the heavens cheers a mud Matthew I'm I ... well\nThe the point is that the border patrol has to tell people not to come into the country illegally uh but what I Will tell you and many others won't is that they're they're abusing the process\nRight now by their not technically illegals and I we all need to understand is if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they claim that they are incredible fear of their lives or or the you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using 'cause they've been told this is what they should say\nThey're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals when they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings\nOr or if they're at their hearings they are told that they must leave the country and they don't\nBut it's important to get all this right and they're not technically illegals\nIf they show up at a port of entry or even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very the I shouldn't say laws asylum process is very favorable anyone who shows up in the United states and and claims that they have an asylum case so\nWe gotta gotta remember that uh she Jay Wright's book about these bomb packages I Know it's too early to tell the monies that it was the Russians they know both sides blame each other and therefore thereby resulting in more political chaos similar to how Russia is paid for political ads on both sides on the twenty sixteen election and promote disdain\nTJ my friend I\nI Can't tell you if you're right or wrong on this one I all I can tell you is that\nUm you know we don't know if we really just have no idea um be the way that we don't know who's behind this\nWe know that it's a it's a terrorist act and that's that's kind of where I have to leave it for now I don't know the speculation at some point can lead you down a road of\nWell let's just say that once it turns into more wild guess territory you're really not helping yourself or anybody else out so I'm trying to I'm trying to withhold my found this and how you guys know that so I ... when they're tough call that I feel strongly about them I'll make it right away\nAnd and I knew right away that it was of the fix was in against Kavanaugh and that that was all hit that was a an ambush\nUm but you know that that this one\nI just can't tell you that I have enough of a enough of a sense of what's going on to to go to deep into it I'm gyms\nTelling the truth and gas is there a part of me that thinks that if you were trying to\nCreate a lot of sympathy for the Democrats are and for the last right before an election that this sure that everyone is thinking that in the back of their minds but that's not enough to say well that's what I really believe that's what the evidence leads me to believe is happening that's a different thing\nAries right a brilliant analysis as it concerns the media's propaganda toward Trump\nThey'll ... simultaneously say somebody a Trump is in Newton's pocket while saying he will start a nuclear arms race with Russia\nMaybe they're flipping out over Trump's handling of the show the incident try to create the narrative the Trump is in a K essays pocket\nBecause the king of Saudi Arabia because the narrative him being Russia's pocket isn't working out so well funny how you call the situation with kids and turkey like a scene out of the Sopranos I thought the best way to handle it it was like a scene Sopranos especially dealing with these characters\nMax Boot is a disgrace I have a few of his books I won't be buying any more\nBy the way speaking of jackass is did you see Don limit reading the ten commandments with Max Boot on air and how Trump is violated\nThem uh men\nThere you go ... man I always know that\nWhen I when I get ... areas as part of that is for that scene but\nGrew when when they write in telling me\nI'm doing good on something I Know I'm really really do an excellent stuff you're doing really good work 'cause if I'm if I'm Marilyn and then a little bit which I never do that if I'm just not you know if I'm not a hidden triples and I'm just getting on first\nBase with some part of the show I'll hear about it I'll hear about it uh so I appreciate that area's thank you for writing then I'm\nTired of the book I Can't believe you haven't mentioned the assassination of general ... an attempted assassination of general ... in Afghanistan last week there are a lot of us veterans who depend on you to help the country remember that we're still fighting Afghanistan\nYou spent a lot of time talking about 'cause show the but not on ... what's up with that I'm giving you a partial pass because the midterms but I just um but just you know I'm disappointed oh as as Tabitha Tabitha you're\nYou're right you're right and it it it's not a wasn't a a conscious choice I just got caught up in the news cycle you know day to day out like everybody else that's that's trying to put together a Daily Show and a and I I uh I missed the\nI missed the boat on this one um yes there was an attempted assassination of a U.S brigadier general Afghanistan insider threat Taliban infiltration this keeps happening and uh in and they got a general a rustic and Afghan general\nAnd you know now they're going after senior military ah they're very senior military officers\nAnd we can't protect her very senior military officers the masters of that sends all the way down\nThe uh the chain of command is no one safe anywhere in Afghanistan now that that's the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not look we're not we're in the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either in Afghanistan we're losing our area of control was receding\nAnd we think that because we don't have that many of our soldiers doing frontline patrols everyday that they're not\nQuite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way that would be at other stages of this war but there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's gonna be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women are going to be the ones that have to keep ... from falling\nSo a tablet thank you for the reminder I I did read about that story and had done some research on it I I have also reached out to see you know to a ... odd\nThrough an intermediary is all is currently in charge of ending the Afghan war for the administration I should say is damaging a peace deal to end the war\nFor the Trump Administration I'm hoping to get in for an interview in the next ah four to six weeks I'd say realistically but I have absolutely not forgotten about Afghanistan at all and uh and you're right to call me out or not get into that\nGet into that story um and spending way too much time to show getting but I've been telling me what the ... all about which the other people are really just about bashing Trump and also how journalists care more of a journalist than anybody else\nSo uh that's going to be how we close up the freedom for today friends good to have a lot to talk about the rest of this

Maxine Waters at her offices in California a male facility on lockdown a total of seven devices filed a bill to leading Democrats or the officers of CNN President Trump at a campaign rally in Wisconsin mowing the culprit will be found\n\nWe trust our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes\nEven though we may disagree with them it's always been the case Americans even if they disagreed with ... with the government\nOr a a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light the boat the EU's constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries\nBut\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries little over\n\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history meeting sixty one where\nDistrust of the system so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil why don't we decided but the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system was run we have a ... we have a civil war there was so much instability at that time the civil\nOr broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on front lines there were a you know border\nDivisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\n\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulp and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut the establishment a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain who now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military\nHad identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on\nContemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there were major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and I actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be infringed in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution number two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably or Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate edition of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing and speculating about being state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst that this is a\nAn invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been the dark commanded a\nLeads from the shadows but it needs to be clear here\nWhile we're lifting under rocks for false flag proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\n\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis\nAnd chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressman during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just were attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering and the media today\nThe only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\n\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to accept the bombings are part of a civil war tactic is becoming more and more pervasive fees are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence\nThat are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nThe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's they're journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent a journalist we've had rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders\n\nJust like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\n\nThe films so remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible for the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a\nRenaissance is is forty years sequels selling out to the theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced us to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nWhere do you also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in the film they live carpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens\nThat appears to be some silent alien infestation the echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers if you remember that film however in the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenters shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and may have allowed technology to run amok they have allowed the lead to choose their values they are unaware that the war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nThe message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions there no resemblance to reality\nThe agent provocateurs greet these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices and in others throats these types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nTheir symptoms if Tom part of or within the realms [noise]\nIn the confines of civil war in the United states of America\nUsing the constitution eliminates these problems using the rule of law eliminates these problems [noise] any of the corruption and purity

verdict from our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United\nStates and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one and others throats but we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former

you\nKnow just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only

haven't really pastime\nPossible ... that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit that are just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of him because you can appease

I'm All right well it's already gone edition or a girl that\nI Know sorry clarify a magician and they can actually send you an earth down there and what they do is they will go and I'm\nLooking for

allow him to mail under\nAnd yes you are and we need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\n[noise] well I Am sort of retiring I Am much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and these um January November and December capital even two months about going anywhere\nAgainst my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your standard I got to tell everybody\nWho might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this there's not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my son he tape recorder out I went ... interviewed stamps and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been out some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near a big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nStamp tell me tell me what's going on in the fields have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the ...\nHe'll case you've got books out what's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word began it looks like there's about one point six planets per star not bring galaxy her start\nIn our galaxy the Milky Way has some hot button under ... star so that means one hundred and sixty billion planets so they're all over the place\nAnd you know that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special\nYou know there's only a few solution to the ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we realize I Would look we're fusion for example or you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and part of the world was created and four thousand ... see that's really can't be too late beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be just\nLike they are just a little the little uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her family [noise] um we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there and\nThere should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization I mean people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but the mirror throws a limit that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nYou never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're standing you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that a while we think there's one point six planets for star select gift like huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably coming here uh I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand planets in our life out there and we see it\n... you know they would make contact\nThem land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that\nNorth America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place and we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the\nBig oil or were still slapped [laughter] and and so uh what\nMost of us have learned that it's more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of planet the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter] no ... and so what we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year\nOr so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that it'll be people don't get\nThe goodies of our from their work uh we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know I've gone through the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... the nearest person and all almost kind of stuff in\nThe universe crowded [laughter] you know it takes a while and yet here and

encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual N. Y. U. haul New York very soon his name's officer Brian golf one\nAnd so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy\nYou know you for already endorsing the book yes or if it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nYeah absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Arthur\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer ... one\nAnd went actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had dialogue with officer guzzling since then\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over it two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just\nGod awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods and they reported it to the local police and so the first night\nThere were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the UFOs or I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet what's your take\n[noise] well I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell ya story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like ah of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book would be knock it talks about the ... the thought of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called enough one those\nNeff alum had unnatural sex acts with the beast those field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these ... ah you know made it with ...\nI find anything can be to now think about this and a lot of these cases there seems to only be one foot friends there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trove of these types of friends\nAnd I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax then perhaps this\nCreature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think of the old Patterson give them all and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] Mm I don't know it ...

Nineteen Ninety One July twenty fired Nelson Mandela died how ... how will remind\nMe of testosterone and asked about it and then he died two thousand Jane on the other one\nIn high school I did I say again on the JFK assassination\nThose poor people in the car no by John calling his wife was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife big in that car as well because supposedly governor Connelly with its head off though with one of those bullets well\nNo you're right the governor calmly was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets magic bullet but we're was a were was his wife\nTo his left so Conley was in front of Kennedy\nAnd his wife was to his left\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third world a third\nSeat there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um [noise] with Connelly and his wife ...\nWill you will you know now when you you know you know I think con Connelly\nI remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they track the\nMhm Conley was sitting in front of\nPresident so he got hit but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president uh that's the way I like the front seat I think he was in the French\nAnd so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another seating there and then a driver\nOr a or the other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you look to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker down Tom and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over and what is described Kennedy back with his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film right now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a congressman front there I don't see a third row of seats\nI didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks stop\nThat's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor crime and his wife and his wife was to his last president Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt straight and I mean I definitely know the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this study that as well as William Cooper is one was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have been left and that if that's the case and also\nHe's driving so they'd have to take his eyes off the term and then make perfect shot you know with his left hand\nAnd everybody wants to see that\nYeah so I you know I don't buy that one every\nWith Bill thanks for being behind the secret door you have given us a whole lot to think about when the new book comes out get back on the program for a full
