world's few science based paranormal investigators he's done a firsthand research into all the different phenomena ... and this was cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well let's ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA you know studying this kinda stuff

know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and do things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly to answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking ghosts again\nAll right you know they're like we're going to be the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool idea there is a monster

three to five [noise]\n\nBack to coast to coast am county Willacy here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with been Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history I'm silly it's scary and get the panic can get kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nTelevision shows around that kind of Halloween and that we are the fun ones the little peanut characters that's the only sign with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that ... that he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not just that you actually\nI was just such an offensive I was like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and\nOf course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to offer but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really take ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do you think the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist\nOften X. rated the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so that you can see all the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this that you know this yeah law something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it for money isn't always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second we use of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials be Haiti and they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nOf course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nThe first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as ornate and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much you really continue to do that how do you see this future on Halloween how do you see in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on us no good question you know I think that um you know ... ...\n... Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each ... each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far a in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there is asserting innocence about it\nBut I think he's really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids left just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nHumanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and ask them for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be sort of you know virtual a go of you know where you've\nLike holographic you gotta you gotta\nYeah that thing that would be cool\nThat tried that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to ask them about the state panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is will assume ... tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\nOr Tom Clancy those books included the hunt for Red October and patriot game guys in Baltimore at age sixty six following a brief illness during a career that spanned nearly Thirty years Clinton and more than two dozen novels a number of which were made in the hit movies and popular video games\nGotta feeling sorry for the\nThe house David you're either has overcome a severe issue of whether the light the light bulb went on and I started\nTo research on the same reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough they made me feel so much better I can let me tell you one thing\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy gives me like ...\nOr how to better way carnivores built everything back into my body taken a while but you know ...

say\nEverything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like 'em but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creeping meal mall haunted house it reached out and grab a crook somebody or whatever and it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that for every one of those examples you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know what I mean I mentioned before you know so and what not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of conservative causes a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they worship anything\nResembling the Christian double at all I mean they ... if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some goat creature that you know the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about one or the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA feeding and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at this coming to Eighteen you know ... forever which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is fine uh of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more obviously comes up\nEvery year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighty with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a a good a good investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to see James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a hold of it if it weren't you weren't\nStrictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so so concerned that using the word you board was going to open up you know demonic corals and whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rules are going to sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from Halloween this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh uh we were um and I grew up\nIn Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was not wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to Christmas just lay allies right down the\nMarathon bars on either right away I assumed those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nThey were great oh I'm sure you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real or on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here that\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with lots of USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the said panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating\nStage their past doing the tricks and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody the abandoned homes or\nAnd that if they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops forever if they're that they're they're sampling environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will go here and we'll be there for me um midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around will print provoke us lost her things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it at ... pm am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do the sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get for cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost undergoing location they because team of him and do you know do take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal wrapped around we need to know what's normal\nWhatever readings you get\nYour walking around with him after sector magnetometer whatever it is whatever it is you get over that six hours that they can be normal variation on there that you know only happens once a week or something\nIt's just been jamon Radford that we're talking we're learning about how he is describing investigating guess his theory I said look we've got more of that coming up stay with us because we're celebrating will is we\nWe all experience difficulties\nMedicaid that yeah that sometimes they kept trying to turn the\nWeather is obvious physical challenges or struggles in the inside they drink they ask for help when you need\nA new that I had to get support\nBut for the sake of my wife and kids\nThe legendary ... he can't get the very last moment in for one thing that you're on the GW also and Sunday Madam Secretary return receipt in central on\nMonday nights you know the Iranians even more by the wedding highlighting the final leg of the history they can show begins Monday central ...\nHe's a nice person alone Gary college Kurdi B.\n\nE.

T.\n[noise]\n\nHits coast to coast am Connie Willis here will is to wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford\nThen that means that by definition their their material because you know sound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know the recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field detectors and the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates\nMe because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for I think I Want to ask you what do you think I mean you think they're cool ... what is it\n[noise] well you know um I I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hundreds unbelievers across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there's something that's going on and\nThen you know it was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and trees that is the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit of the dead that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because goes can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and\nYou know there's the dead so so ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think\nBut my my best guess if they're real would be basically Couric explanation that would be there I'm sure if the debt that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving us the information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to but are coming up so we're

out there right now early morning for him and we're talking about basically the werewolf of London the flicks didn't werewolf in particular\nAnd uh if you go to our website there's some really great sketches\nSome of the uh with\nTestimony what we've seen and we were just talking\nPreviously would fall down the uh where will that we've seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured these sketches DePaul by the way he's an artist as well just when you see when you see coming to life\nWell someone you know drawn I did it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former harbinger\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the ... ... this\nCattle grazing it's looks along with it being the old so to lake but I don't have much in the sediments and everything is produced so it's a fertile ground very fertile ground oh yeah yeah I don't think that that's why the cows and not race officers in it you know the\nFirst thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing or you know\nAnd he did it a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and Robin since ... some places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um\nIt was at a place called Fox ... in written Dale which is eight miles from flicks than and he still lives in ... I mean it's an interesting story\nIs that did you ... it was with a friend he said and he noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the proud to be snazzy with my roommates net to catch the ... and the other game small game\nIn his words ice is proper sort of ... born and bred and he's with what he ...\nHe said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing a sudden there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see so two rows of its own as you're looking over towards the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime\nSome of the lodge hedge hall forums and things about he said he probably eight to ten ... so I mean you sort of turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it\nOn the left over the head ... he said what he thought he was a young halls he meant halls so HBO the blessing to the only one of your also first\nSo I couldn't believe what I was looking out so what what we're saying is the biggest thing was as big as a small town it or you you know your house\nIt's an interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expert to host to lend to move forward because of the the momentum this thing just limited and stuff like a magnet\nSudden something not to be nice to look at that\nHe said it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before you run away he said when he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the store to open to the being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said you know he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... and he said he was almost sort of Britain tilling cooler you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers\nAnd\nNot what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge to them to try and get a fence stave it says to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world\nOr what quite incredible um you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county and if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bumps than drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd ... such as supposed to be aware of that was sort of going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and if you go further up the coast you've got\nOld folklore no legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven ... to ...\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down to being hunted down in time ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the store is so that was a side thing in the Nineteen seventies and they lived in Britain do all his life and\nHe's never seen it since he's never seen it before that and they'd never seen it after that\nWhich is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story about if this thing was native to that Saturday you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it Connie Wilbur made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I did people before we had\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote you are in I Would have hurt target and and she targeting she mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was just looking at the national territory that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these poodles\nAnd it was time war and they would just go through one time or another and you just see them when they pop in that particular one you know we're we're a human with them\nUm I find I find it also interesting when you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest operational read our base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a funny\nThat might be my phone about coats out people just\nIt does it got no no\nNo well is showing Nobel laureates all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this listener has to do you want me to hang up and you catch me back because of\nThe piano will well you're flying right now for sure and will do that if the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange operation arena our base the oldest one is in the midst of all these happening now you're talking about\nThat is correct on the ... and ... ... briefly jumping to them to where the animal mutilation is taking place there's ... there's a radar based there which is eleven miles from stocks the world as the crow flies and that one's close not one closed about Seventy two are officially said sixty eight but he was still operational of the ... to Seventy two\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audio ... some of the ... the ... okay now\nIt's gone [laughter] so it will definitely contacting back on one of his other phones that he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out ... strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know\nI don't know you all those other story will\nA swing continues here on coast to coast am I'm tiny Willis and we've got Paul Sinclair is our
