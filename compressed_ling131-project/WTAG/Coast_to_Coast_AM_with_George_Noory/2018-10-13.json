simply safe no re dot com simply say nor a dot com\nLike\nPlenty back\nOn yelling led to shop online column said that you bring down I knew in my mind candy on line to find out\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's\nA lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman\nPriest exercises I don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and ah have your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have\nFocused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies their energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra system just about every religion\nBut they all but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and past\nLives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets\nAnd there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't\nKnow but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it it they need help to everybody\nEverybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly dot com is book is called power

we'll get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nAh both a just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStandard essential yet a bunch of them it haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was against for years and years and years for youth all invitation I finally\nThey talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and uh so\nUh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with are quitting and and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people didn't believe in ghost had you know on a couple of ... their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cars are people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but\nVery heavy gold she it was called the gold room and it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place has really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite need\nYeah 'cause they'll follow people home negative spirit just they will get\nChanel to get your later so I was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me was the miss shape the spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they want I don't react to this you know the\nSay the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song\nThat I'd never heard\nReally I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know ... shot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI ... I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I Try to change me a from being very happy\nAnd we've been very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time I was just you know we think after a hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion\nAnd actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just felt a looming\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client and I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh is usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the\nCalls come pretty quickly and not only times\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world they don't have to travel everywhere Skype telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just working negative environments and they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away\nAnd they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nFeel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate\nNegative energy and we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit and so\nYou know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have\nTo look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a business\nOr a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea\nOf a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has an effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional\nEnergy schools people go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its\nOld very beautiful but I mean think of the moon energy just\nLaid it and so people will be calling

gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but\nJeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues I didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and I have had\nA problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that what happened often ... board followed me as it said it would\nI've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated\nMan and I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house was sage and everything else [noise]\nSwipe believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury for the other question go ahead Teri\nUh yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion features that for a beach that God go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nUh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it's it it it's the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs dia de Jesus means humanity and cry means anointed why [noise] okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a I I that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat you no matter how much knowledge we know where all the same boat with God\nBecause we habits did nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then uh our entire white we we are and and even all that is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut

problems [noise] a depression anger issues unhappiness or overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so\nAh ah demonic spirits are experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries it's even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office\nMy girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work of doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power\nSuddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it ... the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle\nSo it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the trip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what\nThey say now I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things\nIt's not my job you don't have time for the spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits\nSpirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I worked for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy field I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... or whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions sisters out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get rid of them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things and pass lies helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift or I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they loved it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream of a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream\nBut what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream fruit\nShe hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you're okay where you\nAre I'm engaged hanging um I had a um a thing you could do to believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know\nAnd um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if they do all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm going back to the point when I was out of jail whatever and uh uh I asked God and I was like ... ...\nYou know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me 'cause I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I it started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened when\nI started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle my spirit and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight and it seemed like everybody and when he had frenzy everything he did he touch with no I mean you have a one my ... in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids you know\nNo oh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it it's something told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he just didn't have one at the time and um I Believe that it was kind of me just to show me that you know how it works or you know and then so [laughter] so I bought a church in a ...
