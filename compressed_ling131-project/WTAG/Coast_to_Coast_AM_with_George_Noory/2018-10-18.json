I'm a grave digger yeah oh yeah yeah\nAnd that's the name of the isn't it really is that a wait there was that was a wrestler right now is a monster truck oh monster ... that's what I meant monster truck I knew that I knew that\nAnd I've been looking for the uh the drop to [laughter] whenever you tell the story I just want to play the drop but I Can't find it somewhere online for sure\nYep well there were there we go so uh that that is that is we're Sexton comes from John is next step here book great show great hair shields high with regard to Leslie stall on sixty minutes while discussing their families\nBritish and the border isn't it interesting that she said the law was on the books drawing Obama but he didn't enforce it\nIsn't that an admission of guilt hey no numbers this time I'm well John I Would say that it's not an admission of guilt but yes it's an admission that it was Obama administration policy to ignore parts of the law that Obama did not like\nI'm so yes that that is a thing that the Obama administration would do and it leads to lawlessness\nUnless it is for very specific reason and it's a it's John Ford true a resource and prosecutorial discretion justifications if it's just 'cause I don't like this thing so I'm not going to enforce this thing well that's not the way it's supposed to work\nBob\nWrites Google Play seems to be behind on posting your podcast thought you'd like to know I don't know John that happened we read beyond the puck I suppose this week\nThat seems strange to me when you get that out sooner\n... writes buck thanks again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message now I Need some advice to help resolve a political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of lies and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes the other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust devote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion Katie Katie a very very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much for writing it\nUm [noise] well you know since I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question\nOf establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations is is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want or act the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want in a politician and I have\nTo say that I've evolved on this issue of it I think that\nUh principles are most important for you and your day to day life but principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of mix look what happened with justice Cavanaugh\nI I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now that varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's\nPeople who are who are\nGrotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take\nA trustworthy on policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a\nUpstanding but legislatively\nOn palatable Democrat I suspect\nRobin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive snowflakes\nAre they are completely ignorant of Langston which they distort truth to make their agenda seem plausible there are so ignorant they can't see their own delusions and so delusional they can't see their own ignorance it's psychosis which requires a diagnosis hey look it rhymes\nI didn't Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there is no area in which they can see truth\nHuh Interesting\nThank you so much for writing and yeah I Do think that there is a a mass hysteria and really a mass psychosis that has overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks it's your chatting regarding Elizabeth Warren here are some fun nicknames a liar walk the fraud resume or\nThey could do we are I guess instead of ... we're out of course Pocahontas and Pocahontas Michael\nWell Michael you are certainly a creative fellow appreciate you writing and sat\nNext up here he says I have no idea why no one has had the possible murder and Turkey's Islamic problem with my three combat tours in the middle east as an infant treatment I never saw stories of babies rounded ovens dead families to include journalists make them shut up please\nOh I was on the ... is turkey is as long as problems ... um yeah you know ... you're not hearing any criticism of Islam you're only hearing criticism of Saudi Arabia in this whole\nUh this whole murder and that's not by accident the left is very quick to criticize religion that is not Islam\nBut it's very fond of defending Islam\nAt every turn even even radical and more extreme interpretations of Islam\nWhich is really where the problem was so there you go I'm Jen writes the way you hear the news talk about the reporter at first I thought it was one of ours this is not our issue not our citizens not our our

you're on ground zero\nHey thanks for taking my call that a lot of sound bite kinda sounded to me like an old dial up modem modem trying to communicate\nWell it wasn't a dial up modem it was a it was the the sensors that are picking up where they say is a rattle under a under Antarctica and that's what they are picking up it's rattled but some are arguing that what it is the wind blowing across the snow or the ice and that's why we're getting that sound and others were saying it may be from something else completely because\nThey've been receiving these neutrinos signals and they didn't know what they are so something is active in Antarctica something is active in space right now they're shutting down the telescopes and there and they and they are they shut down YouTube for temporary period of time because something they didn't want us to see went on in space last night was going on right now in space\nRight but uh but I I don't think it was a mother or my or something else other than that and the train those uh that's like a radio reporter so to me\nI was just bizarre I think it's bizarre that the that's the sound uh that uh they picked up on and and while it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think in some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in all the coincidental some going on in the past three days\nBut I liked it off the single going into that coming out it's the same and the strengths\nAnybody anybody can take the signal and they can speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the stigma because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals he'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be to have all this like rpm and you'd get all these weird sounding side band voices going on\nSo or the you know whatever they said that could be I get really even slowed down side band or a spin upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they're saying it could be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust to create this type of\nAh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet and sounds like something you'd be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film\nAnd uh once again I I played it and I get I'm getting worried that when I play that I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block me from playing this I mean what's going on and kind of reluctant to play it again but maybe if I get enough demand I'll play it again so people can hear\nOne quick question and uh every earlier saying more about that you sort of the sun\nThe structure in front of the sun\nI thought that might have something to do with all this\nIt it's one of those things that we get out into the the ... that's for sure that something you know that they were looking into a sunspot certainly connected to this we we we never know though I mean sunspot shuts down and then all of the telescope shutdown\nWe have the rover shutting down on Mars and then we have YouTube shutting down so he's telling me the Amazon shut down and I don't know what that's about it but maybe maybe something else is going on maybe this is some sort of a test maybe I don't know but it just seems a little weird a little awkward\nTo be talking about a possible alien invasion some people are feeling like this is how many of the invasion would begin that you know we can't have the ... rocket going up and sent it back down and get away you can't go into space the INS is banned in\nA you know all these things are happening and no one's giving an explanation as to why except the budget going in to protect the planet from extraterrestrial attack have just increased Ninety million dollars which is also something to pay attention to\nIt then you know that's like the winter may but\nThat doesn't sound like when to me either I agree with you mark thank you so much for the call I agree it doesn't sound like the wind doesn't sound like anything like that it it's\nIt's just too peculiar and if you tuned in and I a lot of strange things happening you to shut down last night possibly because of a viral video [noise]\nIt was sent by some man who apparently a looked like he was military warning people to something was about to hit the moon\nIs

like eons\nYouTube finally released a statement on the issue saying it wasn't clear at the time what had caused the outage but then about thirty to forty minutes later the website was restored our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein were the lord and what do you think happened\nYeah Google isn't going to get into the technical details on this the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nWell it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video stream for the people from YouTube from different locations around the world if it's not all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so of the fact that this was a global out it's just that there was

since the last time we talked about student loans or they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ...\nThis rehabilitation at the end of process they wind up signing for much newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents or get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nShe's in the ... these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well these these companies own servicers\nThey own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandage they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone that remains exist good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nNot rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time that the whole process starts again\nShe stay with us Allan let's talk

sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer hum and let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves\n[laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a ... something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared\n... federal um\nA fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of\nBankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring horse in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can\nBut at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices tricking lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank at a private line of credit [noise]\nUh and do it that way because we then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know church of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee\n... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a\nFour year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was a story just recently we're losing\nA guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and just really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses just killing entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give

get involved in this\n[noise] [noise] oh well I had a um [noise] I um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to fall so they will your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em ... and ... your loans to default which is\nWhat happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government we used to be interviewed I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there of course I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later [laughter] and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change and very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh\nYou know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick in by that I mean you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWould just what you said they want to ... so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great\nAnalogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income\nPeople um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know\nDisadvantaged uh under privileged people under yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth\nAnd they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars she's crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nI got good news for a man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big sign up for it to see all day and he looked right at the hold that thought oh [laughter] I Love it but uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on egg wildly when a company went under the under the conflict in a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time for a company pretty much on very late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I Love her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little\nPiece of paper saying that I'm there without too well and I think well over ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars just for oh I think it was a two month course just on well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up feeling now unless ... ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not a surprise that even\nA let's get your reaction to this Alan what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nThank you for taking my call\n'em I Want to publicly thank Allen he's the one pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you set for dies the loans especially the taxpayer on hooked on it and it crashed the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nOK I already knew the bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's

[laughter] sorry here with my golden retrievers and I had a question like I Wonder what are they bought\nOne of the Jane what did they barking\nYeah good question and try mark and yet I'm Sorry yeah all\nOf this year I just be careful maybe ... or something the odds are pretty smart cars aren't\nGood dog or a mom and dad are golden retrievers then they're excellent guard guy they found like Savage bet they're just in general they can invade I saved my sanity you know and a specially talking about the long run\n[noise] thank you for asking charged sure [noise] and my question\nIs I just got this thing in the mail jak today friend didn't even have all the time the label where it was fine and it created in big letters final nowadays\nYou haven't heard from the company but it's kind of unified document services they say in the unit around consolidation ... reduction program and how can I can turn and right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program\nAnd I have no idea what that is that I was going to ask if it hurt at this company or and\nLike a scam dummy Ellen doesn't it do you have student loans up their gene\nI Do I Do I got my fellow CSI and you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of ... cameras out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one\nWhere they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in default ... who they can assure through this loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to reach ... your loans and so we consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point don't I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got the letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars a year in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone typing faulted you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a close up you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of of if you if you want to negotiate\nFind the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nAnd I have a friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and union\nLeaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they ... they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nPromise not at all that one once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up

Nick worked for the United kingdom ministry of defense does to getting your photos and other mysteries\nHe's been called the real ... has been working as a consultant or spokesperson numerous ... the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about he leans at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great\nTo have you it's great to be back on the shirt how ya doing these days yeah good thing\nWe did we last see each other contacted the desert we were there when you\nAnd I'm now was that before off to your life event in Salt Lake City which we did\nA that was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to to try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for ... relationship with this\nPhenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't die if the kinds of vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive\nDefense intelligence agency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you're like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years people have said the\nProblem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen their their landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to a than a than a third one\nBut now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then this this rock stone guy and then this is a millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course I denied it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically you bought your rule\nWell I took a long on on on that one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also questions I when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio ... you know you had it often headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one ... well I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it\nFrom from start to finish and that's a departure from a it's a completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing or people like ... just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish would they will use at the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this\nField has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go on to the platforms\nThat the young people need to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he got together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times when the story I I Do ... ah\nYou know in some ways the story I think has fall down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon wonder reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization now like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel is the momentum is what do you\n... when when you said the organization um he\nRight yes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had forty two ways says in these sorts of\nSituations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much pomp because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow are the people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nAnd lead them to think that that they are dealing with what they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here might come up come up again this a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm a pretty extreme with this\nAnd the the the individual who wrote that they got to fight intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense carried name project ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some slightly old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to stay as being the print the power of the air and back I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople the idea that you might be on it\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] [noise] yeah and it's frustrating you know than because and and it's almost I mean clearly ironic in another way that\nYou know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry dependence you got a bunch of people who thought this we're dealing with a real phenomenon and we should be investigating it researching it in a proper\nScientific manner and we come up again skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm skepticism is the sort of\nIn a coal ah intellectual\nA human skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a ... probably trying to be driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that the ... well it's just in one sense it's slipping one on your plea fringe belief for another ... these ... these people were skeptical told they would\nBelieve that they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on the coast to

alien\nPresidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot\nAt the ministry of defense and and he ... the um lost to files in in the what's now being a ten year program to declassify and release them\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's jumped the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks are\nVery famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly would we would set aside our differences down here on uh if if we\nFace some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try and there's been there's still talk of disclosure\nAre you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think the the things that are happening now governmental way he's trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this Seventy years they can be overloaded questions\nTo answer about that no I I think it's more likely and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up and a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government UFO your files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release you know without compromising\nCertain classified information um ... you know and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite want to if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci he works He depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though when you say\nWell he was clearly a visionary genius [laughter] I'd have been a time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yeah\nBut I think there are some some others or you know I mean I had a job in the ministry defense where I was paid to think the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved the remote viewing or anything like that like you work with the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nWe saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some trade tests that that sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably one what but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about ... son street can Stargate\nThe ministry of defense going into this briefly and about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think the ... only it's now classified and only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's that it it wasn't a very good study I have to say it um didn't ...\nSome of the U.S program because it was an intelligent program\nThe age old problem they they much but they didn't go out to people that they should have some of the
