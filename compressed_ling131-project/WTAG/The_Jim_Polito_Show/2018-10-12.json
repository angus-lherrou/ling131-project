the reasons we're hearing gas is to raise\nMoney for the hospital and by the way sixty five Seventy percent of that care that's provided here is paid for directly through donations and pledges but the other reason we're here is to encourage people to come here\nWith their child they have here and and it has been a long time coming in last year's radio and help to fund it\nInpatient physical therapy rehab for chill [noise]\nWhich is the place up there I don't know if you've seen it Kevin it's incredible\nBut they have their for children but you and I if\nWe were to a break a bone or to have a a serious orthopedic surgery needs to rehab plenty of places for us to go so called beds there are no\nInpatient physical therapy\nBeds are around here shrine ers\nSaid okay we'll do it and that is what a lot of the pledges went to last year\nAnd right now there are four kids upstairs in a state of the art facility with things I mean it would take too long and this break to explain some of\nThe medical equipment and devices they have up there like a a zero gravity machine it it has this matrix that holds a child up as they really learn to walk let's say you have a ... or even crawl\nI'm a ... a child who had a pediatric stroke\nRe learning to walk now by the way for you or I Kevin you know the brain and the the connections don't rebuild the way they do in a trial and so everything you can do to help that child rebuild those connections pays off zero gravity machine where if the child falls\nThe matrix and the harness that they're in knows that the child is about to fall an adjusts\nAnd so it gets to the point where the machine does less and less to stop the child from fall and then the child is walking on their own it's incredible and that was a direct result of a lot of other people but the pledges from this radio on last year 'cause that's what we devoted to when I took the tour\nA last year that piece of equipment is something that they didn't date they told me there's something that Tom Brady used rehabbing an injury he has one\nYeah I mean imagine that right and it does is it ... it puts it takes all of the the gravity and the pressure off of a joint off of whatever to to get it to heal to get it to move again right and then slowly returns and the kids\nLike the younger ones they make it into some type of virtual video game I don't even know that they're re happening this they're having fun right yeah so anyway ah speaking of fun we're going to take a break but we want to give you the number one more time a four four three five zero Ninety six
