yeah\nAnd here's what I wanted to tell you I remember saying once before so this is the perfect time to call you said once before you were interested in people who have seen spirit ... and I haven't been seen them I I did and I I totally agree with you George how you feel about the league report\nI I actually I did start with that when I was in about sixth grade but when I was around twelve I started the spirit and the first one I saw and and I do have a question for you Bruce\nOn that real quick the first one I saw I Will never forget because it was completely unexpected\nAnd it was in the doorway when I was getting ready for school it was a cat it was actually half of a cat\nOr a whole host of the French have other cat dragging itself across the doorway what was the other half\n... uh well here's what I don't know but it was ... its legs were going way far out in front of it like dragging it off and it was clear as day and I many after that\nI actually contacted one who am I had a name for a real weird name I wasn't going to say it on the air but I Will quote quote down and I actually named the cats after ... later\nBut I saw these every day and night even which show all my friends and once at the YMCA in St Louis I wanted to tell you that George\nI don't know if you remember the YMCA\nWhen I when I went in the way back then there was a\nFair way that was all dark and I shut the door and had all these kids sit on the stairs and I asked is that spirit to show it so it was it was like it's big go that appeared right like on a movie screen\nOr does she have that and yeah so I've seen many I once I had a girl I took her and it's always better when it's dark I took her in a closet at I spent the night at our house\nAnd I asked them to calm and spirit start shaped

you know I I pray and communicate with my angels every day and and here's the thing I've been told and very psychic I've been told I Am a medium\nBut when I was about Nineteen I cut myself off from that because I didn't want to deal with any real negative energy [laughter] so I feel like I'm not using my gift and I'm just wondering your take on it\nShould she be afraid of negative energy is a minute left burst\nYes she uh she should be very cautious and uh when you when you get into the spiritual mowed the connection I always say something like I'm opening up by I use the star trek thing I'm opening up a all healing frequencies to all good and kind spirits\nAnd with my spirit guides also helped me there are also called gatekeepers to protect to protect me from any negative energy so

Welles ran and I think it was their thirteenth episode it was Nineteen thirty eight okay radio was king\nRadio was king\nBack in Nineteen thirty eight and you know radio is really chopping into the business of newspapers and that's where this legend grows let me tell you the real story so anyway it was one of our program it started with the the music for the show\nAnd that announcement at the evening show was an adaptation of the war of the world's you know the novel by age ... was\nWritten Eighteen Ninety eight yeah who's just before the turn of the century okay\nSo this was followed by a prologue read by Orson Welles which was closely based on the opening of the H. G. wells novel talks about how they had been watching a for a long time the Martians now\nUm the next half hour of the broadcast was presented as a typical evening radio programming and then what they did was interrupted with a series of news bulletins now the first few updates\nInterrupted they were playing dance music\nAnd they said that there had been a series of an odd explosions observed on Mars\nAnd then there was the report of an unusual object falling out of farming Grover ... New Jersey than they went back to music then they went to a live report in a crowd of curious onlookers have gathered around a strange cylinder coal object\nThe situation escalates went out Martian emerged emerges from the cylinder\nAnd attacks people using heat ray\nSo this goes on a little bit\nUm and the show didn't have commercial interruptions mercury the mercury theater show didn't have commercial interruptions so they kept going\nNow there are other people listening to\nA Edgar Bergen\nOn another network and then they turn to and over and tuned into war of the world's but they need me here the introduction that said this was all fake\nAnd they panicked and there was panic in the streets I remember seeing a movie about as well and that it's not true here is the real story what happened is that newspapers\nAnd some public figures spoke out the next day because they didn't like\nThe idea that they use the radio and they and they may they did this live theater\nAnd pretending that it was you know you are listening to an actual radio report of an invasion just like you could make a movie now or through the eyes of the news telling you the story of an invasion\nWill the newspaper Baron that's been like that\nAnd they started selecting their muscles and saying that the FCC should do something about this\nThat's the real story there weren't a lot of people who are panicked they really weren't it wasn't like you think like you were told it was All right\nThat's the story there and no it didn't air on Halloween a lot of people thought I didn't know what he'd aired on the eve of Halloween it was a Sunday night in Nineteen thirty eight\nDie Nineteen eighty three the Reverend Jesse Jackson announced plans to seek the Democratic presidential nomination Nineteen eighty eight the reference sun young moon conducted a mass wedding ceremony in South Korea for more than sixty five hundred of his followers\nOkay well we can say crap before six o'clock yeah now that's fine yeah ah\nWe're going to talk about Halloween\nThat's okay yeah I Love Halloween what am I ... I about Halloween flag flying right now\nYou do you hear a little already kind of torn between like Halloween I keep thinking it's over because I started watching the hallmark Christmas movies and how much\nIce ice on line that you were doing that it was annoyed because a cap he loads up the DVR\nWith him and if you watch them and then I also save them they're all over the place you're also good I I'm not saying that\nNo the same time she's doing that I'm recording horror movies are movies not not you know like classic our movies on the DVR so that I can watch them around Halloween\nI did it break them lifetime which is still you know murdering people like every episode there somebody in the bathroom and he's just like I I wanted something a little happier than at\nScience so I'll get it that I won't watch them but sometimes I'll sit in on that with caffeine driver crazy because coming in the middle of enough they know who's that\nOh gosh you just want to tell you lightly snowing perfect\nThere's always lightly smelly yeah we're else's lightly snowing accept the hallmark movie\nDoesn't mess up their hair down that was shot in July somewhere so good well back\nWhen it will will rewind to Halloween okay which technically selling happened yet and yet but it's great and it's quite a lot of people dress up their pets and um\nYeah I've been a lot of people I Do want\nThat yeah I don't like seeing people do anything to animals other than\nReally wait a minute that's not a coffee and for me it's\nNot like an abuse thing you want to take a German Shepherd and you put a little little fruit for off it on a minute stop it\nI used to have a little dachshund a little wiener dog and of course I Would dressing up in a hot dog role every year or so great and really that's the original and really not a brother you know what\nA ... a little wiener dog runs out wearing a hotdog bun yeah with a a and people go crazy and it's time with it always get to smile it's perfect okay actually where he was such a little ... we're ... we're all yeah\nI never knew a mean dachshund I live here as he was me crazy\nI don't do well you know they say take on the personality of their\nEventually he definitely was moody sometimes the boy had okay so the most popular pet costumes for the hot dog ... comes in at number two number three is the bumble bee\nAnd a number one is getting dressed your dog or cat or a ferret up as a pumpkin\nI think yeah ferrets of course that's abuse now I really do all that so it'd\nBe a China dressing them in a pumpkin to yeah to be as well as very popular and you know that it's actually up like it's twenty percent of people planning their pets this year that's up from sixteen percent last stop it and make the money to\nMe it's not an issue of the money they really isn't an issue of abuse because of a dog\nIs uncomfortable having something on they'll take it or they do absolutely right absolutely they'll tell you right off it's just it's silly I what else is happening what else is happening we got Halloween coming up tomorrow what else can we fall back on this weekend we fall by half an hour now\nGetting up next week for us and for people like the worm catchers in this hour it's going to be easier next Monday ...\nI was wishing it would somehow sync up with the red Sox 'cause I mean that was brutal I'm Still paying for that\nAny between Eighteen innings and friday night\nI was twenty four hours because you've stayed up all the way I couldn't go to sleep until I had a gig at night and I I work all day and I got home and and I was like oh and he said it for the whole thing I Hope things and I did not stay up for that yeah but you can check my I have an stories I checked in at like\nThree thirty in the morning so crazy I Would be up getting ripe ready\nGetting ready for work I've done that before like a twenty four hour like that but that's insanity that's\nWhy I couldn't get off the couch on Saturday I like it was by hallmark Christmas movies anyway to me to sleep you know things you can do a\nYou know just to prepare for this cause even that transition when you gave me our message people out like I honestly I just got used to the spring yeah spring forward and whatever\nBack in but you can ... they think boost your vitamin D levels that something like you know eating foods like wild salmon eggs dairy mushrooms vitamin D can definitely affect your mood okay and that you can you can get it through sunlight but also um you know some doctors even recommend supplement\nMy doctor ... and that it I take one\n'cause we're not going to sound like a lot and now that the days are getting even\nThough now so that's another thing on my food to his trip to thin they must have this and can also affect our brain chemicals aims including Sarah Tony melatonin which really usually they're moving to also bringing in poultry eggs bananas oh we'll give you all the other stuff is\nOkay I got that but it's so much easier any way to be on a city it's so much easier to do that one the only time that I'm disappointed\nIs\nThe the you know we do it like Sunday night like all of a sudden oh God it's dark\nYou know and then when I used to work a real job like we work nine to five that Monday you're driving home and it's dark and you're like oh I hate this\nYou know what I mean yeah 'cause it gets dark earlier and that\nTook me also say stick to your normal bedtime really that's another thing yeah they'll set up an extra hour yeah I don't do that because it will just make your body jak\nAnd it's much easier though for us to get up on that Monday morning that\nFollowed I don't get any better yeah definitely has a vitamin D D D whatever thinking bananas vitamin B it can be ... no no I

get back to the president and that and we've got so much more to do today which I'm well hold on Massachusetts lawmakers are saying that guns are not the answer\nUm politicians to that they're not armed guards and temples and not the answer I I just want to ask this question so\nToday I mean Saturday and friday night for Sabbath ... how can you guarantee that a temple\nIs going to be safe\nI mean seriously how can you guarantee I didn't say arm everyone there are there are rabbis who carry guns I didn't say arm everybody in the in the\nTemple I'm just saying what what what are you going to do\nHow are you going to protect people who want to express their religion or people who make up what is it less than one percent of the world's population\n\nAnd they're the target you want to talk about a true minority [noise] yep [noise] but throughout history\nWell let's let's go after the Jews but that's the burying the first of the two victims today they were brothers I think they were there was a special needs and they were actually in the kitchen cooking\nAnd the gunman killed them [noise] Jewish doctors and nurses treated the\nUm the gunman the shooter\nWhatever you want to call them I Know sometimes my Second Amendment friends get mad when I say the shooter well he he was the shooter\nUm [noise] he was taken to the hospital and he's shouting I Want to\nKill all the Jews and yet Jewish doctor saved his life\n[noise] um [noise]\nTrump last night was on President Trump was on\nMartha ... show oh no he was was um he was with a Laura Ingraham ten o'clock [noise]\nAnd he said you know a President Obama was blamed for the twenty Fifteen Charleston church massacre\nHe talked about Bernie Sanders and the shooting of his friends Steve ... he wasn't blamed for it and he was basically saying that's right they shouldn't have been blamed for why am I being blamed for this\nThe ... bomber and the\nLeast shooting in the temple but it's because it's politics here's something that's interesting\n... a lawyer for a Trump supporter who was found guilty of planning to bomb a Kansas mosque and an apartment complex where Muslim refugees lived\nIs now saying his client\nPatrick Stein\nWas influenced by the president's rhetoric now hold on a second here I Want you to think it through\nWhen you say that something the president said\nIs responsible for someone acting you are giving them a defense I said that I've set it in the past\nWhen people have complained about Trump\nYou're giving them a defense why can't be held responsible for the snow that person Patrick Steiner was found guilty is responsible for what he did the man who shot up the synagogue is responsible for what he did\nSay those are ... who sent the bombs to democratic leaders is responsible for what he did\nYou want it to be a mitigating factor well the president's rhetoric caused him to act okay then you take away a portion of his responsibility and and you have a situation like this I knew what was going to happen\nAnd I I don't think this makes Trump look bad\nI think this makes the media\nAnd the left to look bad\nBecause this guy smart so is this lawyer\nHey I couldn't help himself he he listened to Trump all the time he lives in the Trump speeches and it told him hey just like I'm just like a Charlie Manson listened to the Beatles white album any heard messages in it right\nYou're going to blame the Beatles\nThat's that's where we're going\nThat's exactly where we're going\nAll the president are showing up at the synagogue is going to be divisive mill you saying that it's going to be divisive\nIf he's welcome to the synagogue\nBecause he's the president of the United states\nAnd then you get a bone\nRight now\nThat's a a solid gold Tuesday evening from bad\nAnd then a ... if you want to step it up a notch you get a needle\nNow look I'm not poking fun um for the sake of poking fun I'm just saying in terms of consistency\nIn terms of messaging in terms of where we are as a society so I said what the marijuana thing we put the cart before the horse\nTo really think this through the same time you're handed out needles to protect people now there are those who will argue with me and said Jim if you have more recreational marijuana use you'll have fewer opioid addicts the science and the research on that is debatable\nVery debatable if I thought that\nIt was concrete and and there would there could be I I'd be more inclined to be very very supportive\nIt's just that the science on this is not as a President Obama would say he would say is settled I Would say it's not settled on that yet\nAnd you have mixed messages going to people All right to be coming up with a ... he's she's one day away from his all important Halloween forecast\nWhich he gave us at the

Republican National committee is jumping on your comments you earlier on in the show said that Donald Trump is radicalized more people than ISIS has a David and Mona a disagreement you strongly as you wanted to clarify what\nI did want to clarify think I've spoken to get on a very emotional and ...\nFor ... for time for me I\nI I don't care you said Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS I don't care if you're upset over a shooting in a synagogue I don't care if you're upset over bombs being sent to Democrats\nAnd CNN I don't care Julie a\nBlow off if you cannot control yourself on the

talking about\nThere's been a rise in\nAnti Semitic attacks and it coincides with President does a lot of over the past year and President Trump has been president that's like saying that the the cost of Twinkies is gone up because President Trump is president\nYou know it's it is what are you related to why don't you think about this what else has happened in the past year well let me see um Louis Farrakhan is stood on stage with\nBill Clinton he's called people termites Keith Ellison and the Democrats have created this anti Semitic policy of boycotting Israel\nOh that's got nothing to do with the right to solve Donald Trump what Donald Trump to maybe he did make for a rise in anti Semitic attacks because he sided with Israelis and said yes your capital is in Israel more on\nThis when we

difficult for them to get a message to me and it goes in Danny into this weird folder\nThat I Can't find half the time I Want to I Want to see it anyway\nI got all these messages\nFrom nurses now a couple of them came from\nCentral and western Massachusetts so I looked at that and I said okay those are people who are listening and they stop all started their message with I heard that you mentioned on your show that you haven't spoken with any nurses who support question one they all kind of started with that same line\nOkay so the one from central master one from western mass\nOkay that's fine but then the rest of them came from like Brighton and luckily our listeners in eastern mass because of what I used to do on Fox and people listen what the her radio app yadda yadda yadda but I mean this was like all of a sudden a bunch of these came in\nAlmost like they put out the word union headquarters email Jim ... so what I'm saying right now is any of those nurses and I can't find your\nEmails and my messenger like the emails that and I never got around to accepting them\nYou know what I mean like you have to accept I read them but then I didn't accept them which moves them and to your regular mailbox you don't need to hear all this anyway any of the nurses\nWho want to call eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six who are supporting question one please call and make your case\nOn the show don't send me a don't send me a message on Facebook I mean it's fine and I love communicating with people on Facebook but I'd rather you call and I'm\nI'm\nWell really uh enlighten the audience here\nFor our own at a vacation over the the the arguments behind supporting question one because the polling out there suggested in the past month that the majority of people in the commonwealth now do not support question one that's a shift\nThere were people that it was um based upon pulling from Suffolk\nAnd Suffolk University does some halfway decent polling I Would say out of what I look at locally I usually look at Suffolk\nThey do a pretty good job and political political polling I'm not talking about anything else but that and they had it as a majority of people well I shouldn't say a a um\n... ah already you know that more people have been more people saying yes no [noise] but uh not over the fifty percent mark because there were still some people who are undecided\nBut now it is no um it looks like if the vote were held today in the south pole is correct that he would a question one would go down so a no vote on\nQuestion one means you do not support government mandated ratios of nurses to patients if you've Oh yes you do support that\nSo the nurses and all of the horror stories they told me eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six\n[noise]\nIf you're a nurse and you don't support it there there's no reason to call I just want to put that out there now there's no reason to call this was purely messages I received that said I've got it all wrong\n[noise]\nQuestion one I got it all wrong\n[noise]\nJust getting we're more important things to talk about a year to the yes that's an important issue so his question too so it's a question three but the president is going to Pittsburgh today\nA member of Congress from the local delegation there in Pennsylvania said the president really shouldn't come east going to be a distraction then it's going to be divisive see the fact that you said that\nHe is a distraction and divisive if you add just shut your mouth and said the president's coming the rabbi from the tree of life synagogue said we would be happy to have the president here\nEverything would have been fine would have been quiet\nWe could have paid R respects today two of the victims are being buried and you know in the Jewish tradition you want to be buried you know the the the um tradition is to be buried within twenty four hours course because of the crime scene and autopsies and not to get gory here but that wasn't possible the two brothers\nWho I Believe um\nWere developmentally disabled the two brothers who were they were cooking\nFor the a congregation and they were in the kitchen when the gunman entered the synagogue and they were killed and then they're going to be buried today\nSo the president will be there today and I think it's a it's a good moment to reflect on this\nWe're hearing from Democrats that there's been a rise in anti Semitism since President Trump became president\nOkay\nSo you're relating to President Trump is there anything else it's going on\n[noise] like on college campuses like boycotting Israel is there anything else that's going on the actual anti Semitism that exists on college campuses why wouldn't you related to that and the rise in it\nEspecially following President Trump's decision\nTo make good on a promise many presidents have made but never fulfilled which was to recognize Jerusalem as the capital\nOf Israel, Why would you related to President Trump's so all of a sudden President Trump is president and anti Semite CERN powered I don't get it I'd love I'd love to understand the connection there\nBe worth the eight hundred miles they still have to go to get through the United states that they're accepting asylum\nOffers from Mexico who is also offering employment assistance for these people are there many of them I Will decide to stay there or maybe even turn around I have the feeling and the whole probably the Trump Administration is that these actions will dissuade them enough that\nEven if they continue on the numbers will have dwindled dramatically by the time they get there\nBy bill excellent excellent I'm laying out for the job appreciate it and we look forward to talking to you tomorrow

'cause I was very quarter someone that is so\nWhen I wrote because you know if anyone that's been in a ... there's like um I think you are or what I said at the code and I wrote a letter to Iran hurting the patient because of the sheer fact that\nWe have a short staff they left us no no I Know a secretary\nAnd we were in there and so when I wrote that the manager and looked at me in his head and I wasn't at first she said you\nKnow I Know you have an issue is far from but you don't bring it into a legal document well the point is I'm saying\nIts hold on a second this is very serious you're making an accusation did you share it with the family did you tell the family pet not allowed\nTo do that in that people don't under yeah at least the the stuff on ... we can get it out of the things that we see patients that\nBut our throw ... from ... I'm afraid we're out thousand plus I said\nWell why why aren't you why are you making ... ... what I'm saying is that when I said to I'm Becky when she called is if you know somebody died because they weren't nurses there why didn't you tell the family and if you did tell the family why am I not hearing about massive lawsuits\nRock does happen by a federal court\nAnd even when they're settled out of court it has to be reported to the ph it's all public record\nIt's all public record I worked in healthcare Rob I don't know hospital\nI don't know how how far behind closed yard waiting for me are concerned and go to our malpractice fire I don't know how that works that something like that I Would say\nHospitals would be out of business if if if the way that it's being presented by the Massachusetts nurses association is is a true reflection of what's going on in our healthcare system our healthcare system would be out of business right now because of not the lawsuits but as you said the settlements due to the settlements\nWere a lot of them from our families are unaware that have come from preventable why didn't you tell them\nAgain we work for hospitals for over ... can be information you want to get fired\nNo no but you want the department of public health to regulate hospitals every day say how many patients Dana how many nurses do you have you can't take more of like well no that's what that's what your lawn is going to do\nIt's going to ask the very people who you're telling me aren't aren't regulating the hospitals properly to again regulate the hospitals if if

the game and you will ... yes when we Robin ... see this is what I mean that's why all nurses don't agree with this this is a political question as far as I'm concerned it's a political question\nWell

they nobody talks about this gym they the the video you can talk about the job loss due to manufacturing yeah those are coming back okay like they'll leave China and they'll go to Vietnam or the vote Indonesia [noise] um that's just a rallying point what this really has to do with is\nThe the outright death of our property\nAnd and that's it and it is and\nJust like your advice if it up to your

and you can get your weather all day long on W. dot com\n[noise] Ninety four point nine up and I got a lot of problems with the people you're going to hear about it [noise]\nYeah but I have never never never never nothing of law and then I get a conviction on us and go to\nThe gym ... ...\nThey're getting a lot of messages from people from Michael who's a nurse\nAbout time best dialogue on the subject I've heard I Am a nurse and I could ... a a a\nBy I could not find any other nurse who had a strong opinion of this other than union hospital nurses yeah I mean I I I'm not trying\nTo dismiss what the nurses are saying who support question on what I'm saying is that once you go into this venue you are now in the realm of politics and while I Love and honor nurses for the work that they do\nUm once you do that once you cross over into this well then you're open to political debate it becomes a bully you make it a political issue\nAnd a Sherry sent a nice no she said what about a sort of felt more for certified nursing assistant some alike here's this scenario I have a hard time believing and it was brought back he said and then we're going to get to ... who's been waiting\nBecky said there were two nurses turning a patient\nAnd someone coded and died I I\nMean I'd like to hear the scenario of the story but if someone's hooked up to machines and the code the machines go off and nobody can get there in\nTime that's a problem I don't know how that happens so if somebody codes\nAnd by the way of somebody codes many you know we think of December leaders and they're very important as being disabled no no no a lot of people who get hit with the the ... later don't come back\nThe fact is we want it to federal later there though because of the percentage of people who will come back we want to save them\nSo without getting into the weeds of that I I just have a hard time with the hard time with the horror stories and then what I equally of a hard time with is if if the government entity that's supposed to regulate this isn't doing their job that's what the nurses are saying\nThen why would we give them more responsibility\n'cause that's what we're doing and plus the price a price tag that comes with this\nNine hundred million dollars I mean I don't think you can argue that it is it's nine hundred million dollars\nAnd look everybody wants the money when it's of their loved one spare no expense\nAnd I agree but I just want to make sure the money's being spent properly\nSpeaking properly\nSo we we talked about this story and it's a story that now has legs\nAnd I'm Talking about the controversy for the\nOffice of registry of deeds\nAnd Hamdan county now we've talked a lot about these judicial positions are courthouse positions and people still run for them it's our tradition okay\nSo why would we talk about a an election like that which really doesn't get much attention well should have all the attention from the entire state because in the election there there are accusations that\nSignatures were forged on a nomination sheet the names are put on people who never signed that nomination\nCheap and then we find out from the secretary of state's office that local authorities that verify nomination sheets should really just ignore the fact that if it's Raul written in the same hand or writing\nThey shouldn't try to be a detective just verify the name and address and the and the voter registration and that's it joining me now is the Republican who is running for that seat that Donald bash um held\nFor many years ... senior has since died and now it's a race between the Republican ... leads a and a Cheryl Coakley Rivera the Democrat joining me now is Marie good morning Marie Laurence and you're having a very I said your name right ... right\nThat's correct Murray shame on me isn't a you know not not getting this right to shame on me every time I say I have a say differently slow\nYet to find people do that all the\nTime there's a lot is so Murray let's get into this because Anthony I'm Maury the Republican he was running for secretary of the commonwealth came out to these long meadow and said hey this is ridiculous Bill Galston\nIf ... if signatures on a sheet are obviously forged a written by the same person\n... this this this nomination she should be thrown out\n[noise] and my understanding is that the first line of defense or the county clerks and ... had to say that says on the paper they have to pay the factory similar to how they think it sure was registered\nUh back when we look at the paper we realized that with the same handwriting things ... ... pages on\nOffer you had on the air wrote down the wrong address at the time about other people's things so it it was clear or a gun or fraudulent way on him I\nThink it All right let me let me explain this to folks are you gonna run for office the nomination chiefs and I'm sure you've been to the supermarket and you walk up to the supermarket somebody says they uh would you sign the nomination she for Jim believe he's running for dog catcher\nAre you are registered Democrat or you are registered Republican or whatever and then that she and and for registry of deeds you need what Maria thousand signatures of thousand thing that you went out and got them\nYeah and I didn't have the product that\nNo that's not it's not that's why some candidates pay people actually to do it they pay they pay the companies to go out and get the signatures for them like a quarter a signature so\nThey there were there supposed to the town clerk's office is supposed to match the signature on the voter registration card to the signature on the\nForm on the nomination for him and this obviously didn't happen in the Republican has a newspaper has looked into this they agree and you set it and bill gallons office and secretary state said hey you're supposed to bring those challenges three days after they're certified\nAt when it when we discovered that about a week ago that it was wrong at the time but we go out but the important get burned out because it goes the heart of a discussion of qualifications for the job and I thought I thought that it had the right to know about that\nThere's a little shocked that Cheryl Coakley Rivera who's been in politics going around the block a million times would have sloppy nomination forums like this\nI was not expecting that are in fact we didn't challenge them way back in the gym because she was actually in a primary with a mentor Donald ... failure to Canada in ... yeah that that they have actually\nDo that ... that's right he asked the way I'm Sorry your name and\nYeah he was very popular and um I imagine that they would well I wouldn't be any than a thing would be the final candidate in September so we we liked that deadline pass\nAnd it wasn't into a campaign um volunteer picked up the paper and said ... I Hope that there's a theory problem here and we looked at it and so they kept quiet we won't get as\nWell so let me ask you right out and this is a ... she's Republican running for registered deeds and him the county are you saying that there was fraud or that the city elections office is incompetent and reviewing these forms which is a\nWell they actually can you hear one there was that were forgeries on it we packed up the paper's first thing we did was call paper we knew the thing that you're obviously a not at all nothing handwriting and they all said yes I did not sign those papers\nFor an issue of fraud but yeah there is an issue in regard to the process and I'm ... for a cold\nHas given examples\nThat would be fraud if if they're true like the doctor from long I mean that looks to me like fraud what do you think\nOh definitely they at some of the signatures were their their forgeries on the paper\nThe issue with uh I ... you know where the investigation going to go the right now the investigation has to go into the hands of the secretary state where those from there\nWouldn't be depended on who has standing in regards to following up with uh the ... century which could either be the secretary eighth office or the people who think that transfer actually um I you know for that Broadway and get\nA but we are hand in all of this over to the secretary faith outfits and asking for a complete investigation\nOkay now what about the offices that didn't catch this the clerk's office is that didn't catch this\nWell they were specifically told not to uh you know not to uh to go ahead and certify any names as long as the address in the name was spell correctly\nTo get this call in here quickly 'cause I haven't heard from him in so long and I was thinking about him recently cheap Gerardo Roger good morning center\nOr are you doing I'm good at so good to hear from you it's been such a long time I know I don't well I Hope you're well\nAt the moment I Am\nGlad to hear you want to talk about question one we've only got about a minute\nOkay one thing I did my voting that we are out there yeah and I do a lot of reading on both sides agree\nThat a\nLot of the medical then\nYeah uh well well I think both sides agree that there are some institutions that aren't going to be able to shoulder the additional payroll shore\nOr on their own weight on the gurney 'til they get to\nA yeah I mean I I think some of those ads are true because in a place where there's a limit on the number of the patients that are of an institution getting taken based upon their current staffing yeah people have to wait\nI find very very scary but you might\n\nHave trouble yeah no I understand but are three are going to be accurate\nThat is going to be agonizing I'm Roger I've got to let you go but it don't be a stranger it was great to hear from you and we miss you when we don't hear from you\nToo\nThank you sir I appreciate it Cape Geraldo Roger good guy got a lot of health issues and making the point there yeah it is a valid point to make you make more when we return you're listening to the gym bleed old show you're safe space\nJob Jim what you think never before have we had such a blessing that opportunity called eight five five four zero three nine eight or six everyone from the double duty AG price chopper market thirty to traffic center new fresh report now this is an overturn the vehicle\nOn route three Ninety five north bound it's just after exit three ton whereas rode the vehicle is in the median strip and earlier crash two Ninety east bound before main street and she was very has been moved to the break down ... getting by there and it's a busy ride on genetic eased through was there but not as bad as some commutes\nWith your price chopper market thirty to traffic I might feel as\nIf you see something out there called the double UGA gee traffic hotline one eight six six nine nine nine Seventy two hundred from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nMorning every one of Tom ... cloud blend today high temperatures and a low fifties or tonight clear and colder lows twenty eight\nThirty two of them are all morning sunshine will give away the afternoon cloud high temperatures around sixty and put 'em all night the trick or treaters mainly cloudy skies chance of showers developing late low temperatures in the upper forties and on Thursday cloudy with a chance of showers high temperatures and the low sixties and you can get your weather all day long on T.
