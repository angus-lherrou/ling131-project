probe idiotic\nAnd says I'm agents know that little lies point to bigger allies that's kinda funny coming from the disgraced former head of the FBI because you know I mean if they can investigate Hillary's emails in a few days\nOr we should be no problem they looked at six hundred and fifty thousand of Hillary Clinton's emails remember when they showed up on\nOn a Anthony wiener Carlos dangers computer remember they showed up on his computer what was it two or three or not even that was like it was like a day and a half they looked at all of them by and clean it all up no nothing to see here\nSo you're telling me it can't be done in a week of course Democrats are saying well we can't trust the FBI to do an impartial investigation you didn't say that\nWhen they were investigating or continue to investigate Russia you can have it both ways\nBernie Sanders\nUm wrote a blistering letter to the judicial committee\nOr any said a lying to Congress as a federal crime the FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him Kavanaugh's truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court\nReally Grassley um wrote back to Bernie\n[laughter]\nAnd said this supplemental FBI background and Grassley so Chuck Grassley Republican from Iowa chair the committee\nThe supplemental FBI background investigation was requested by undecided members of both parties that might take from your letter that you are now undecided and willing to seriously engage with the Senate's\nAdvise and consent constitutional duties related to the nomination of judge Kavanaugh to serve as associate justice of the Supreme Court or the United states they have so we should have a conversation about what information you need to assist you in making a decision and I look forward to that conversation\nThe reason Grassley saying that is that Bernie Sanders is one of the people who came out twenty five minutes after cabinet was announced as the nominee\nI'm not going to vote for him\nWell Bernie then then ... what ... what are we what are you doing asking for additional information your minds already made up speaking\nOf investigations Lindsey Graham wants an investigation\nOf Dianne Feinstein ths handling\nOf Christine Blasey Ford's letter and allegations\nUm there's still no evidence\nOf sexual assault\nAnd now Democrats want cabinet invested ... investigative for perjury do you understand\nThat this is going to keep going and going and going and going\nThey won't stop going to stop\nI guarantee you by the end of the week we're going to hear from some Democrats somewhere\nThe following why\nHasn't the FBI given Brett Kavanaugh a polygraph test\nYou think I'm joking right it's ah what time Danny six seven team on Monday morning October the first how long how long until the Democrats says why as ... ... and you know what I Know there's a some liberals in the audience right now saying yeah why not\n[noise]\nHow long until that happens finally the ACLU which has a policy on judicial endorsements they never\nNever say anything about them guess what the ACLU opposes Brett Kavanaugh on what grounds\nSo really and by the way and I just say this um why is it that why is it that\nWe're not hearing anything about the character\nOf Christine Blasey Ford Dr Ford\nNow don't don't give me the old well Jim\nYou can't investigate the accuser\nYou most certainly can\nIt's called the cross examination you come forward what you mean we're just investigating Kavanaugh\nWe can't question\nOr a witness who gave a lot of different stories and doesn't have anyone who couldn't corroborate anything\nI mean if this oh let me give an example you know the ah Rachel Michel do the the the\nProsecutor who interviewed Dr Ford\nDo you know what she said over the weekend she said if it if this was the case she would not bring criminal charges against Kavanaugh she said the case is an example of it he said she said\nAnd said that Ford's cases even weaker than that she is admitted that she is a Republican this woman but she said\nI'm a that didn't play into her decision\nShe said that Ford appeared to jump around on the timing of the alleged sexual assault ranging from the Nineteen eighties early Nineteen eighties and then the summer of Nineteen eighty to quote while it is common for victims to be uncertain about dates\nDr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season in particular year\nShe also pointed out that Ford has a history of struggling to Maine cabinet as her attacker Mitchell noted that the name was not a note from twenty twelve marriage therapy or her individual therapy in twenty Thirteen\n\nShe said that Ford's account has not been corroborated by anyone who she identified as attending the party including a lifelong friend\nAnd worst are celebrating won a

I'm not hurting another victim\nOf sexual assault how I'm not hurting you\nAnd that's what Kellyanne Conway just said there how am I she said we're all responsible for our own actions she means

attacker\n\nMitchell who worked as a sex crimes prosecutor for twenty five years in Arizona pointed out what she identified as timing inconsistencies she wrote that Ford appeared to jump around on the timing of the alleged sexual assault\nRanging from the mid Nineteen eighties to the early Nineteen eighties and then the summer of Nineteen eighty to quote while it is common for victims to be

history of struggling to name cabinet as her attacker\nMitchell noted that his name was not in her notes from twenty twelve marriage therapy or her individual therapy in twenty Thirteen she said Ford's account had not been corroborated by anyone who she identified as attending the party including\nA lifelong friend\nNow the lifelong friend has since come out and said well I Can't corroborated but I Believe her well that holds just as much weight as me saying I Believe Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's an opinion I Believe her okay good people do\nAnd people believe Kavanaugh but absent anything else I'm not I'm not going to stand in the way of a person being appointed to the Supreme Court because of something that comes through the last\nMinute from a person who has inconsistencies and their
