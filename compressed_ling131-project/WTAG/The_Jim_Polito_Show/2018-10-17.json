reclaimed the house\nShe wants to be speaker now will they reclaimed the house\nStill up in the air Donald Trump said that if they do reclaim the house it's not his fault he said because people are telling him well hey I'm not going to vote because you're not on the ballot well if he's not on the ballot\nUm [noise] well uh\nPeople are saying I'm not as energized I think the Democrats need to flip twenty three seats\nTwenty three seats now at the same time President Trump is saying\nWe have the greatest the economy ever and um the GOP will defy history and history says that in your mid term election the party\nThat holds the oval office loses\nIn Congress loses in the mid term\nAnd this is why I asked a question that whoever is president always seems to lose but nobody had an economy like we have we have the greatest nobody reports better than you and that we haven't greatest economy\nYeah we do and I don't know if it's we've ever had he likes to say it like that we have an incredible economy right now\nThat's going to help the cabinet thing is going to help it has energized the base it has energized the base and Democrats can't get out of their own way right now\nAnyway Nancy Pelosi conquered colonial in which is a beautiful spot\nIf you ever get out to conquered the recommend the contribution levels ranged from five hundred twenty seven hundred meanwhile\nCongressman Jim McGovern is going to Boston today to meet with the ambassador to Cuba\n[noise]\n\n\nJaycee do recognize the Cuban national anthem [noise]\nIt's only forty forty eight seconds long [noise]\nI mean in a socialist communist nation that's all you can afford anything more would be too expensive and you know they just they can't afford it you know like they can't afford anything else he's meeting with the ambassador from Cuba\nBy the way meanwhile his opponent Republican Tracy level on is going to meet with us it eight ten had a debate with McGovern on Monday Night and is going to join us to talk about why\nYou should vote for her as a Republican and I wonder if she uses my expression the McGovern crime family\nAnd ask for your she uses the government crime family I don't know maybe [noise] maybe I Will uh meanwhile\nOur entire Massachusetts congressional delegation and the Senate delegation is couldn't damning report that says we have the greatest budget deficit\nThat we've seen in a maybe eight years\nLast time we had a budget deficit like this was under the Obama administration\nAnd they are blaming the tax cut\nNow you can't have it both ways speaking of Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi has said Elizabeth Warren has said that the tax cuts provided crumbs\nTo you and I I don't know about you but I noticed a difference and a no no no I'm not the top one percent but they said it's crumbs robots crumbs\nHow is it creating the budget deficit here's what the problem is and it's a problem with Republicans and Democrats were spending too much we're just we have record revenue coming into\nThe treasury from taxes record revenue and yet we have a budget deficit why 'cause we're spending now part of the spending we're doing right now has to be done\n[noise] we have to rebuild the military it has been ignored\nThat's right the Obama administration just did I mean we we were scrounging for parts for planes do you remember that of course it didn't get a widely reported we were actually scrounging for parts for planes speaking of Cuba I mean that's what people do now down there for their fifty seven shabby\nSince he can't buy an American car\nIn Cuba so they've got all these old American cars that were there and they're just somebody's got to fabricate apart for you if something breaks you see all these old cars in Cuba\nWe were scrounging for parts for our US military for our jets under the Obama administration\nAnd now we have to rebuild that so I look at it like this we have a spending problem just like just like the regular person the government is no different let's say you get a raise\nPeople always seem to find a way to spend commensurate with that raise and they're still financially in the same position instead of taking that money in and applying it to debt and putting some away for a rainy day we\nYeah it certainly was a madman and you and I certainly can remember a taken that polio vaccine at school I used to hand it out of school and the sugar cube or I went to elementary school\nI took bad and and polio certainly was a concern fortunately it was eradicated but this is something they say is similar uh people who have contracted it do not test positive for polio so it's not bad\nBut it's something that that could be similar as well and the thing is it starts like maybe you would have the flu or a bad cold starts with a fever and maybe a respiratory issues before suddenly a you might lose the ability to move an arm or a leg and and that's when it becomes a little bit serious\nSo the next thing Jim as they say what can you do\nUh well they say grief is like you would treat a cold or flu season uh get first of all get all your recommended vaccinations this has nothing to do with a vaccination\nNumber two they say frequent hand washing of course and number three if you were going to be in an area where there are mosquitoes\nAnd they are prevalent uh have mosquito protection either a repellent or make sure you're covered up so uh this is something that uh they are continuing to work on they have sounded the alarm on it even though it is it is still very rare in this country it is widespread and that's the other thing about this you have a couple of\n... it's widespread there is no pockets of area where it is a word as prevalent it's from all the way from\nJersey to California the other part of it is\nIt seems to spike a in the fall early late summer and fall and every two years\nTwenty fourteen at spike the twenty sixteen at spike and now again

I understand the leadership\nAnd I understand a union you hire you vote for your representatives in the union but sorry guys I mean we told you we don't like it yeah and maybe next time around Mr off or or you won't disappear like your dad but you'll disappear from the leadership of the Teamsters\nWell and and that's what needs to happen here no shame on the Teamsters them self though only about half of them actually voted yeah and that's a loophole that ... and he said well you know not enough you guys actually voted so yeah I mean I can make a decision on my own disgraceful though disgraceful yeah and\nAlso just goes to show you how confident they are in the economy you know usually it's All right we'll take it we don't like it but we'll take it these guys feel like ... and women uh\nHey we we can do better than this\nWell they and they look at the way they work do you see him come in and\nOut oh yeah that is not that's not a job where you coast\nWe got clients that are drivers and let me tell you something nice guy hustle you don't see a lot of fat drivers\nOf it I Know you you do it at all [laughter] [laughter] maybe they should go\nBack there I worked a little bit there in the in the summer during college women should go back very young yet oh\n... any way I can do overnight packages stuff Mitch McConnell and are you going to talk deficit\n[noise] well yeah I mean he's I I kind of admire this I don't like the guy particularly yeah he's coming out and saying look we're running in a booming economy were running a seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollar deficit yeah All right\nSo that helps me I Need to cut things like Social Security and Medicare and food stamps or you know what the guy who's telling the truth I mean if if you can't balance your budget in our boots and a four percent GDP yeah to me I mean something\nIn in what kills me is the entire Massachusetts delegation Senate and Congress is saying this is because of Trump's tax cuts and the point is no wait a minute\nThere's more revenue going into the system now into into the treasury you guys are just spending too much of it usually are bending the Republicans and Democrats alike right and you don't have your fiscal house in order\nThey don't and you know everybody likes the social programs until it's time to pay for them you know\nAnd I know that that is so we we need you to I I Need you to go to DC I Need you to get them and explain okay I Know you don't like to work past Thursday but I\nCan you just can you take one for the team Mr Armstrong just one for you Jim many\nNo but it just kills me because you know I use this analogy\nSee when you get a raise or your your your money more money comes into the household you always find a way to spend more and then you you're still in the same financial situation that you were twenty thousand dollars to go and our government is exactly the same yeah yeah and I know we had to spend more on defense because\nYou know our ... our military was decimated by Obama and an Obama and Trump believes in peace through strength and so do I but come on guys\nYou know it's a it's it's it they they and it needs to be bipartisan\nAnd that's what makes it difficult right oh I don't want any party is going to be responsible for cutting Social Security oh that is the third rail bury it has to be done like if they're raised taxes are cut the benefits right oh your choices and then you raise taxes and you're screwed right right\nBarry I'm looking forward to hearing more on this from you today ten to twelve folks the financial exchange Barry we'll we'll talk to you one last time\nTomorrow they shoving until next week thanks bye-bye\nBarrier and strong everybody when we return up best pizza in the country in\n... I'm\nThe best pizza in the country comes from Boston I gotta I gotta say no on that one maybe you want to chime in eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six plus Tracy ... running against Jim McGovern\nWhen we return and you're listening to the gym please do show you're safe space tells you what you think it\nI like pizzeria Regina but uh and it's a nice old style as being way pizza but hey let's we'll get to that later this hour but let's get on to more important things what's at stake right now\nNationally and locally okay I'll tell you\nIt is continuing on the track we're on now which is a great economy or\nGiving the Democrats back control of the house of representatives and going to a far left agenda and one of the people who will be leading the charge on the far left agenda\nIs congressman Jim McGovern I mean look at it so secret how I feel about congressman Jim McGovern in his politics I mean today he is in Boston meeting with\n[noise] the Cuban\nCan I ask you folks who question other than north Hampton in Amherst what does that too from Worcester and southern Chester county [noise]\n\nA third world country right [noise] well some would say that\nGoverns policies of turned off ... somewhat into a third world country one of those people may be the woman who would like to unseat him and help to maintain the control of Congress by the Republicans joins me now in the studio after what I thought was a a a good performance\nAt the debate racing off against Democrat Jim McGovern dream joining me now Republican Tracy live or good morning Tracy morning Jim hey so nice to have you in the studio venture out any I say I appreciate it\nUm I think you win the soundbite contest for Monday Night and I think a lot of people lab repeated it why don't you share with folks that the little exchange that you had with congressman McGovern\nWell you know it was just so upsetting because when I was talking about real problems really she's here in West are and how\nThe surrounding area and it's really thriving yet here in West or poverty rate has increased um how we're making national attention or an extreme poverty level and those are happening under his watch 'em and instead of showing concern for western\nYou know he got very defensive end and blame me for trashing\nHis city um and of course they don't have them back with no you trust your city mhm um but you don't want that and it did make a great soundbite but honestly what about the concern or the problems in western he held absolutely no concern\nWell he's more concerned about third world countries and as I said he's in he's in Boston today meeting with the Cuban ambassador for\nFor one last I looked at ah we don't have any a Cuban cigars stores in in downtown Worcester and we're not making parts for fifty seven chevies which is what everybody in Cuba is driving right now\nOn you know even throughout the whole debate you know sitting next to him it was everything you see on TV you know it was every sound bite every talking point um that you hear over and over and over again but what I didn't hear with anything local\nYou know he didn't talk about the job the he didn't talk about the companies that have left western high tax\nRates and what can we do to incentivize more business development yeah um luckily some of the businesses that have left western state in the district at a couple of them anyway which is good for the district but when it comes to a rising poverty rate here in the city that does nothing to help\nAnd and I know that congressman doesn't have direct\nControl over that but indirectly he can really try to help an influence that environment here in western\nWe're talking with Tracy lieu on she's running against congressman Jim McGovern and I'm going to step out of my opinion person role and just go to a role as an objective observer in terms of politics which I can do\nI watched a of the debate and um you've never debated before you can never\nThe ... he's been in office for what Twenty years he's been involved in politics all of his life somebody who's never debated before I Believe actually defeated him in the debate if you if you scored on points like watching a boxing match not who you agree with but scored on points\nShe lost on points and yet is weak is he is\nTracy he's got a stranglehold on this area and you know that the district extends to North Hampton in Amherst how do you overcome that\nYou know what I'm really hoping you know everybody listening to your show typically I think gets it we understand we're on the same page we're not enough to do that I Need to ask everybody listening to your show to help\nReach out and we need our Democrat friends to help us win this election and I'm Talking true JFK conservative Democrats yeah love our country that are not socialists Renee see you know a lot of our elderly folk going home talking to our moms and dads\nAnd our grandparents they fought a war\nAgainst fascism they've had a war against socialism they see what's happening and if they don't see it\nThey will be able to see it if we have the conversation I'm that's what I Need help with right now\nYou're making beer making a point about the Democrat Party that I've made and where Jim McGovern\nJust refuses to accept that hey the Teamsters went with Trump now I'm a governor has got a good base of support among unions and I know for a fact\nThat the guys out in front of the debate the other night holding signs come on bought and paid for\nUnion people where he's still as strength I don't understand though while they're why they're still hanging in with him when the majority of unions rather than say the sci use but the regular unions\nAre going with Trump and the Republicans 'cause they say\nHey they're going to get us work well and that's just it you know what it they'll get us work and when there's more work and more jobs available the worker actually has\nFacebook chasing all born for Congress\nAnd then Twitter changes for Congress with the number for you know social media is really the only way we have to get out there\nAnd we're not a one and a half to two million dollar campaign which is what it would really take to do this that quote unquote correct in right way yeah but the fact is we have so much working in our favor right now I'm you know\nJust national politics every day we're hearing that it's it's just resisting and fighting and so much awfulness has happened watching what happened to Kavanaugh will just an embarrassment to this entire country you know enough is enough um\nI just need your help every listener out they're eating out there talking to everybody you know finding are real true Democrats that we can support in trying to fix and help our country um we're not a socialist nation and I really truly believe that that that's not easy\nEasy question that's being answered in this election is which way do we want to go do we maintain are are a Democrat or Republican you know our constitutional hobbling where are we going to continue to slip down the slippery slope of socialism and that's exactly where our current congressman wants to take on\nMan is a radical I'll agree with you there and um but Tracey I appreciate the time tracing the born folks taking on the McGovern crime family tree she would love to talk
