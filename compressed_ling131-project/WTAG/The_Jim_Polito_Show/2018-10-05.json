what she considers\nOr did you stay up no I didn't watch the entire game but you watch some of the game yeah except for the whole thing you did Steve I'm\nTotally exhausted and it's totally worth it when you're when it's okay [laughter] but\nThree touchdowns a four by Rudy yeah four four by Brady greedy while I'm how was everything else in the game why would you ah what would you gentleman say the game tells us about the rest of the season\nNot much even if you're not building you know these he's bringing his the patriots\nAre building towards something they've gotten better week by week which is their goal or they kind of treat the early season kind of like the extended preseason yeah he'll be playing it best football come January ... in October and it looks as though they're building towards that ...\nThey well they are I mean right now it just seems like in the AFC there's only ... five good teams so you're going to play the really good teams and then you're going to play teams like the colds who are\nAverage at ... and so uh it's tough to take a ton away from it other than the fact that they were prepared they were ready to go and uh the more offensive weapons to the team gets back\nAh the better the the better they're going to be so um I guess you could sort of take away that\nUh my biggest issue if you'd like an issue in the game yeah uh the uh old paid the old patriots running back that we all love James White is number twenty eight or the new a kid that they got the new or a young study is number twenty six now if if I Can't get a commentator did tell me who\nIs in the backfield I'm going to lose my mind tell me who's the guy because twenty eight and twenty six when you're watching the game or a very difficult to say it is ah I Know that ... ... you know your book\nYeah Joe Buck with this with is a a ... a totally naturally colored hair or if I can get him to tell me what the running back is that would be really appreciate it\nI like that you can't pick on Joe Buck Joe Buck said that he became obsessed with going bald and he had multiple hair transplants\nMultiple he's got some weird thing about is hair did you know that to any new ball he wrote about it\nIn a book he was when he was younger he was deathly afraid of going bald okay and he had multiple hair transplants out for those if you don't know what I hear transplant is they take donor hair from the back of your head where the the hair is least likely to fall out\nThat hair in the route is the hair the least likely to fall you know to somebody who's even really really bald like you take a look at congressman Jim McGovern right I mean ... ... per se he's got the ... he's got the horseshoe but in the back of his head\nOf course there's not as much but not enough of a donor area to cover that whole dome but he's that hair they're as resilient so Joe Buck\nHas had so many hair transplants he's obsessed with it the back of his head must be numb because I'm told by somebody who did have it here ... you know when they take the hair out of the back of your head you lose like some\nFeeling on the on the back you know like above your neck where they take it out a he said you lose some feeling there you have like a weird kind of numb feeling they're back in his head must be complete you could walk him with a bat\nAnd he wouldn't know it it must be so no\nI was

Y. tonight I'll give you more information later but it also streams so much\nCentral as friends you can see we're talking about we generally talk about issues in a low a local politics meaning the commonwealth\nBut um it sometimes gets local above Springfield it sometimes gets national today is going to be kind of national and state wide one of the issues will be by I'm told because they give us some of the what we're talking about\nQuestion one or the nurses question which uh I Will be voting no one and it doesn't mean that I Do love nurses and don't think that they're the best in the world but I'll be voting no on that we'll be talking about that tonight or Steve another shameless plug you've got your show Sunday\nOh that's right the sports Sunday from a new one here in W. H. Y. N. and it'll be nice to uh the nice thing about the Thursday night as I can do a post game on the patriots as opposed to a pretty good yeah we'll talk about the game last night a little bit and or might have some special guests lined up as\nWell you'll ... you'll actually have a two Red Sox Yankees match ups to talk about too\nOh yeah I mean more money more than an hour I might have to maybe as a no fly about choice I only the hour that oh well you could talk to Sean about it\nI don't know that's a good idea [laughter]\n[laughter] when we when we return you may not pay attention much to what the state auditor does but you should\nAnd where is the current state auditor in this whole state police thing well we'll talk with the woman who wants to challenge her you're listening to the gym police do show your safe space\nAnd we really need to work and in different ways in view problem differently it's not the solution that were thought possible fifty years ago well they were the solutions where they\nHelped A L and finally he thinks there's the staff in the office do you think the resources are there is tomorrow you were put in charge you think the resources are there\nTo do things like catch this this massive scandal within the state police\nBecause this thing called the ... the tip line I'm I Can't imagine nobody called the auditors office about any of the I Can't because people like I said the most people want to do the right thing and and it seemed that this was blatant\nAnd everybody nobody but nobody did anything about it you know and how she didn't know about it that's kind of a red flag right there\nAnd my point it from my point of view it here the idea that you've been in government since the eighties\nYou know everybody up there yeah at this point in time and again to be focused on things like the iron they which Baker cleaner or putting so much effort into thing should want to be part of the solutions of what they are working on right now rather than\nGoing back in ... and\nYou know the claim that are just not true but\nThat's how that's how I deal but it going in there I Would I bring in people that\nAre very specifically knowing certain areas of government and making sure everybody has like you know speaking to one another and crossing right especially when it comes to um\nThey the apps and mental health and all that it's all connected all connected and and that's when somebody needs to get up there and work again with the governor and what he is doing and\nWorking to get it it it goes to have better government and and also where the tax payers it's our money I work to be as though if we only play twenty percent of the note that given concert we're not going to have many people very happy with with us and not you know that's my analogy\nVery interesting on telling his or anywhere that folks can get more information about Helen Brady and your candidacy and are you on your campaign to become auditor of the

from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nMostly sunny most of the day to day the higher around sixty five clearer cooling forty overnight mostly sunny for Saturday the high sixty five to seven eight looking ahead to Sunday mostly sunny although we could see a cloud or two in the afternoon a little bit warmer the high Seventy five to eighty [noise]\nLive from the

going to do a little bit of a tale of two cities were going to get the ... don't worry we're going to do a little bit of a tale of two cities here and it's all about traffic and we're going to start in Worcester Danny you're familiar with Kelly square right\n[noise] you're driving capital of New England yes the well the the the demolition derby although there are there are fewer accidents there\nMany for waste stops where you have traffic lights I think Kelly squares basically about eight roads that converge there's a couple of yield signs there's a couple of 'em stop signs that's about it just went through yesterday as a matter of fact no problem\nNo problem well anyway as part of the paw socks coming in Worcester they're going to rework Kelly square\nWell on October tenth the Massachusetts department of transportation wants your suggestions on what they would uh [noise] what they would do to fix Kelly square\nAll that's going to be a fun so I mean I I have no idea by you know I\nI wouldn't even be able to begin I Will say this I'm One of the people\nWho says fix it not save\nIt this is something that's been debated now for forty years yeah would come up with a plausible solution well they just really I haven't really put anything ... nobody's ever step forward\nAnd said hey let's fix this you know\nI mean Kelly square makes the X. looked like in Springfield Steve are familiar with the accent it makes it looked like a\n... I don't know ah\nThe plot still is it like it is it like the way stop any fundamental 'cause we've got one of those and then yeah we\nAll know it's a much I Know what you're talking about any flying ready you know much worse much worse Kelly square and it and it's right off of a major highway so you've got traffic dumping into it\nFrom both directions of the busiest highway the one that runs right through the center of war started to Ninety so picture in Ninety One you know like dumped into a traffic nightmare off of Ninety One in both\nDirections I mean they've hey if they can fix everything on east Columbus in West Columbus and all that and the casino that can fix Kelly square it's just going to take a lot of work but why they want public input but I'm telling you are right now public input wise\nIt by year people there saying say Kelly square my head's gonna pop\n'cause there's no reason to save it\nNo reason whatsoever to say but it's nice to be able to talk about it and well the old timers will be when we're old\nWill say wait staff or an intersection wearing orange\nDriving walking biking it does it matter Kelly square I don't know why I entered navigate three I I don't know why anyone would want to buy through Kelly square but for some reason the Blackstone bike trail goes through Kelly square course the the pay for that lane has long since worn away but\nWell see it live and in Gallup poll print on my brain\nYeah I Know well I'm going to leave one final indelible imprint on your brain before we get to the forecast yeah I Want to ask you about I Know that you haven't lived in North Dakota for a long time a long time\nI Know but you do know the state and the state hasn't changed that much over the years I Would say no no Heidi Heidi Heitkamp is the set one of the senators from North Dakota who happens to be a Democrat who announced yesterday that you would be voting against\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court now\nShe has a Republican challenger she's the income but she has dropped ten points in the polls leading up to this now I don't know how much he's going to drop after yesterday's announcement Tom is in North Dakota primarily a conservative state\nYeah very much so in fact when I went out there at the University of North Dakota yeah back in the sixties and when Kennedy was president I remember listening to so many people talking about uh how because Kennedy was Catholic yeah ... actually the hope was going to run the U.S\nGovernment yeah I mean there was that was the men\nAnd there was a lot of that going around I don't know if that particularly relates to being conservative or not because there are a lot of Democrats who\nWere Southern Baptist do weren't crazy about having a so called pay pissed but Tom it it is I mean most of the most of the industry out there now\nIs they're doing a lot of a petroleum a lot of drilling a lot of yep fracking I mean typically that leads to a conservative\nElectorate because people are working in that industry they're going to be more likely to both conservative\nAnd there's no question about it and places like Williston North Dakota yeah\nBecause of the oil boom a it's almost impossible to find a place to live a because number one so many people are now up there and number two because of that and you know I hate this law supply and demand\nWhen there are so few hotels or available the rent the guy rock\nYeah yeah so I made it and and well that has spurred kind of a building boom up there too oh yeah to to make up for it so I don't know time we're going to have to watch it but I just wanted to get your perspective because a Democrat\nTaking a she's a Democrat elected in that state which means she ... she is a blue dog and then second to take the vote against Trump in his state the Trump won by\nTommy a more you know a high end the double digits or I think he won by twenty five to thirty percent over Hillary Clinton I mean that's a big big spread 'em to take that stand and be that low in the polls\n... you're probably not going back to Washington in January\nProbably not not All right I Would guess the Republican well when\nI Would too All right so let's get to the forecast and see if we went through the weekend\nYeah look pretty decent one for today it will be breathing a for a mix of studying clouds high load 'em at sixty four tonight clear sky high or low temperatures and some of the lowest spot in the thirties tonight\nBut generally speaking in the low forties and the city and for tomorrow and again on Sunday Sunday to partly cloudy skies ice tomorrow in the sixties and hides on Sunday in the middle seventies Sunday should be a pretty nice day\nAll right Tom maybe you have a great weekend we'll talk with you on Monday okay Jenna thank body Johnny B everybody you can get it from him forecast North Dakota politics got it all let's discuss\nA Republican senator\nIs going to possibly miss the vote the all important vote on Kavanaugh not because he doesn't support Kavanaugh\nBut because family comes first I'll share that story with you when we return you're listening to the gym please do show you're safe space\nWhy ... ... well on that level that\nMy ... the Jim ... show ahead rather than a private relationship ... although in\nThis report from the double duty AG price chopper market thirty to traffic center riding volume\nUsually a little bit lighter and that seems to be the case today no hang ups in Worcester just he had one forty six to nine and looking good one night as well looks good we are seeing if you slow down with so traffic on the mass pike east bound beginning at the root nine interchange in continuing into Framingham and then today that you're probably ... market thirty to traffic I'm Mike\nEllis if you see something out there called the double UGA gee traffic hotline one eight six six nine nine nine Seventy two hundred from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nMostly sunny most of the day to day the higher around sixty five clearer cooling forty overnight mostly sunny for Saturday the high sixty five to seven eight looking ahead to Sunday mostly sunny although we could see a cloud or two in the afternoon a little bit warmer the high Seventy five to eighty now [noise]\nNow [noise] there's a senator that I\nReally don't know that well but what I learned about him in the past twenty four hours makes me think this guy as his priorities straight Republican senators the Danes\nOf Montana ... yeah you think like Montana yeah of Montana and um [noise]\nHe's got his priorities straight\nYesterday he said he will definitely not be in Washington tomorrow to vote the Senate will likely be voting tomorrow on the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh\nHe's not going to be there he called\nA judge Kavanaugh the other night said I'm Sorry will be there I support you but if they ... if needed they can hold the vote for me until Sunday 'cause I've got to go home why is he going home Saturdays daughter's getting married Montana and he wants to walk her down the aisle\nThat the guy who has what was his priorities straight he does support cabinet but he's not going to give up on that very important moment that's a good good lesson there\nI mean I like that and uh they will\nYou know they'll have a private jets for him if needed and you can hold open a vote in the Senate if the majority leader wants to hold it open Mitch McConnell he can you can open until Sunday when he gets back and then boom he can make his vote if needed but will his vote be needed we're going to talk about that\nAfter John ... news at the top of the hour plus it's freestyle friday you make the call you pick the topic it's all you eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six you're listening to the gym ... show\nMisses your safe space the Jim ... show\nAt best you weren't competent at worst were complicit and either way it should be fired person\nI'm an attorney John Hammond as a motor cyclists I find that fall riding is my absolute\nFavorite but remember that slick roads wet leaves and distracted drivers taking in the scenery are some of the challenges that we all face during this great season with over thirty\nMany of them uh don't work and the other is a ...\nThis blow off classes for the day to go and ... is he married you have time to go to the Capitol today in protest [laughter] well no I I don't either by really all I've got a job to do I have lots of things I've got going on I I don't have time\nFor a vote for throwing freestyle\nThey are Mary ... excellent point thanks for the call from South Hampton\nI'm Danny what are they chanting in the heart Senate building and in the halls of Capitol Hill right mark [noise]\nYeah and that's\nNot what democracy looks like it all that's where the anarchy looks like do you know what democracy looks like well first of all we don't have a democracy I'm so sorry to break that to you guys you protestors Amy Schumer and the gang getting arrested\nProtesting we don't have a democracy wherever representative democracy see we're too busy most of us working and with our lives so we empower representatives\nTo do the work for us of governing we can vote them out of office whenever we want but ... we have a representative democracy we ever public we don't have a true democracy\nAnd if we did have a true democracy you wouldn't have a chance because liberals you haven't won at the ballot box\nI'm into explaining why they are losing it right now why would we are going to look back on this period some day and say\nThey were done the digging up stuff about a ... year book\nHere's why\nThe liberal agenda\nWhere does the liberal agenda\nSucceed\nDoes it succeed at the ballot box\nWell you could say an individual states like here in Massachusetts may be but where does it really succeed the liberal agenda it succeeds in the courts that's why the courts are so important to them\nThink about some of the major decisions that have been made\nWith our ... our representatives voting on\nAbortion gay marriage then anybody vote on gay marriage federally did anybody vote on gay marriage now I'm not I'm not talking about\nEither way supporting or not supporting gay marriage and I'm not making a I'm not trying to open up a debate here on gay marriage what I'm saying is\nWon in the court it was a liberal\nOne in the court it was a liberal issue\nThe reason that they're so concerned about Brett Kavanaugh being appointed for life\nIs that he's not going to do that\nThat's why they're having a collective nutty and doing everything they can\nThis is the most important thing to the liberal agenda to the left is the courts if we can get activists on the bench we don't need to go to the dumb voters the racist homophobic Islamic phobic voters you know the ones Hillary was talking about\nWe basically have a dictatorship we get the court to do it [noise] it's done\nStunt [noise] think about Iraq Obama other than Obamacare what did he get through\nThe Congress in the Senate\nNothing his victories were in the courts\nAnd through\nExecutive order that was it that was hit I mean he may have been a popularly elected president but when it came to his agenda\nWhat did he get done\nIn a lasting way\nNothing other than Obamacare and that was done on a procedural trick it was we all know it was\nWhat did he get done\nNothing\nThe liberal agenda the left agenda does not stand up to voters why\nBecause the average voter says on some of the crazy stuff they come up with that doesn't make any sense to me that's not that people are hateful and\nRacist it's just people say a lot of liberal stuff they say that doesn't make any sense I'm not going to go with that\nSure there are enclaves throughout the country where one of them we got the tofu courting around a north Hampton and cameras in that area and of course in one twenty\nEight east got the tofu curtain\nOn the rest of the state and get people saying that doesn't make any sense to me I don't get that\nThat's the problem now next step and we're going to get to build them for our national correspondent who will lay out just where we're going to be over the next forty eight hours how it's going to work\nBut Justice John Paul Stevens who's Ninety eight years old and I knew until I read this last night I didn't realize she was Ninety eight I knew I hear retired I knew he was old\nBut Ninety eight years old he had supported Brett Kavanaugh previously\nHe'd actually I think he had mentioned Brett Kavanaugh on one of his books talking about a decision that came out of the D.C court of appeals the cabinet authored and said this guy would\nBe great for the Supreme Court now John Paul Stevens is saying he doesn't have the temperament\nTo be a member of the Supreme Court really Okay John ... let me ask you this question let's take you\nDuring your confirmation hearing\nAnd subject due\nTo what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with\nWhat subject due to what\nBrett Kavanaugh had to put up with and see how you react\nI don't think that has anything to do with your temperament he's got three hundred decisions and how could you say that his three hundred decisions were sounding good and this guy should be on the Supreme Court then you see I'm Upset because his name was dragged through the mud\nHow could you\nSay he doesn't have the temperament I Would say that if he didn't react that way\nNow granted he went a little overboard and himself in the wall Street Journal piece yesterday said I got a little too emotional\nOkay\nWe've got a little too emotional nobody ever said that about any of his uh decisions did you see any one earlier\nThrough the process of his confirmation until they tried to sneak listen\nThis is this a sex assault allegation did anybody say you're a little too emotional and your rulings did you remember hearing that during the during the hearings no you don't because it didn't happen\nBut John Paul Stevens settlers and I don't think he has a let's put you up against it and see how you react not not as a Ninety eight year old man but when you were younger let's see how you react to it which brings me to another point the media\nNBC has has published\nIn Webster police there tell us a man who's been arrested after merging it on his ex girlfriend in finding her in bed with another man he said James Kelly than stand that man and ran off from the windy ridge road home he was

more\nYeah he was a pretty broken up and I made a comment but\nUh yeah and then he's often that we all love Mike Mike he's off next week\nI don't know how trying it is for him to work five days in a week is going to require a few months dress\nNo yeah you know listen you've got a buddy sits on your shoulders now my the whole thing was well again congratulations so jobs report it's not out yet though but I Would I Would expect we will see um we'll see good numbers\nYeah I mean we're we're going to see good numbers because the numbers are already so fantastic that it would be tough for them to\nA be toughened he's like really the expectation because the numbers are already looks so good but there's some areas that they might be able to feed expectations on so I mean the the unemployment rate has already so low that we probably won't move too much the expectations are forced to drop down to three point eight percent\nAh which is you know almost unheard of in terms of unemployment rate um what we are really looking at though I I could care less about that but he was already so low what I'm looking at their wage numbers what are we going to the moving on wages because that is what is going to\nI think we you know one of the things that can actually carry this economy going forward or if it leads consumer spending on the downside a lot of people are really worried about inflation at this point\nOkay um and you know that's the worry if you've got too many people working\nAnd as we've seen your dad was telling us yesterday about\nTeamsters a UPS threatening strike we don't like the contract that are that are union management a union leadership came up with that kind of so many goes the other way you know I mean it's it's nice for the individual but then it might not be nice for all my investments\nYeah yeah I mean that's that's what people are worried about it and right now that you know actually the future they had they had been down a little bit this morning they are about flat right now so I don't think anyone anticipating this wage number two really\nBlow it but you know books vacations out of the water a but anything's possible you could see surprises\nA you know as it is we're expecting a to point eight percent you and your life increase in wages anyway which is pretty solid if it comes out at three three and a half and uh you know keep an eye on equity markets today\nIt's alright microchips what do I need to know\nWhy this goes to the you know that China by chip story\nAnd ... you\nKnow the story at a Bloomberg Business was that a basically that you know Chinese government has been implanting micro spy chips into Amazon's servers a bunch of apple products\nYeah does it sound like something out of a movie buff enemy and paypal or something else it just it just does when I first read it that's what I bought\nAnd you know and so Appalachia came out this morning and said hey you know this report isn't true we're not under a gag order for many judge you know we have not identified this as an issue\nBut there are ... Bloomberg businesses that this has been part of a top secret investigation by the U.S government going back twenty fifth ... um forget about the trade imbalance forget about everything else if you want to read in a slap sanctions on Chinese good here it is\nYeah if you if you can show this and say look at this and this is how their their their their way of stealing our intellectual property in

unionized workers on the one hand there is and then you've got their various employers or throw on the other and they use it with the whole purpose of the union to step into the situation like this to

fits all and here's what I say back to the nurses\nWe have the Massachusetts department of public health\nIf you think patients are not receiving the care they should receive\nThen here's what you do

it and what it's going to cost and what it will do to health care look I I agree there are some times decisions made in healthcare that are not\nUm advantageous to to the the best quality outcomes but
