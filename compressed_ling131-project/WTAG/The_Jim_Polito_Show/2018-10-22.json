W E a G Men double duty ADHD Worcester and I argue radios\nBut he showed up last night and the WG B. Y. studios that's where the debate\nWas last night and I must say carry cell do who'd I'm\nHost the show that I go on once a month a connecting point the state we're in I'm One of the panelists if she's a great job and I think in the debate last night [noise] um\nHe showed up sat on the road to try to block her car all this insanity\nAnd it's\nI have a problem with it because I don't want people who are opposed to the radical agenda the left to begin to drop thing their behavior\nDon't start acting like them I mean I steal some of their play book by like you know uh the rules for radicals by saw Lewinsky you know ridicule your enemy\nI knew that because they do that but I don't adopt any of the other stuff\nAnd I think it's foolish if you do you want to go out in the street\nAnd um and protest that kinda stuff\nNancy Pelosi was accosted by some Trump supporters\nAnd I don't I\nDon't agree with that they use foul language I don't agree with that Mitch McConnell Republican\nMajority leader in the house he was out to dinner with his wife who happens to be secretary of transportation they were back in a um Kentucky\nAnd they were trying to have dinner some idiot came and started yelling at him you're trying to steal Social Security from us and it was great because people in the restaurants they get lost get outta here\nGet lost ...\nSee now that won't happen in Washington DC because\nEverybody in the Washington ... restaurants probably liberal I Would speak up I Would say get the heck out of here\nScrambling [laughter] we're going to talk with bills him for about ten minutes or national correspondent this caravan\nContinues to go forward in Mexico toward the United states border and bill will have the latest on you're seeing seeing people\nIn that that are addressed and they're trying to get away from you know an oppressive country and it's mostly men by the way\nUm the men are concerned where where are their families\nAnd not only that well we'll get into it with Bill\nIf\nYou're a country like Guatemala is so bad and you make it into Mexico want us\nTo stop there really because Mexico isn't isn't in turmoil like them interesting [noise] that's kind of help I think Donald Trump\nAnd so that leads me to what I Want to talk about until we get to the break and we get to build some PR which is the so called blue wave I did some reading over the weekend sort of research over the weekend\nAnd I remember I was the guy back in March you said I don't see this blue wave and I'm going to continue to say I don't see a blue wave first of all in the Senate side I see Republicans picking up seats in the house\nThere's still a chance\nThat Democrats could win enough seats to gain control now how many seats would they\nWill gain control by what were their majority be it would be in single digits the way I look\nAt it it will be in single digits not remember back in March I said\nThe Democrats are definitely going to pick up house seats\nIn Pennsylvania and the reason for that as redistricting and it hurt the Republicans and Trump remember was strong in western Pennsylvania it's one of the things on election night in twenty sixteen when I started to see\nResults coming in from western Pennsylvania I said wow\nThey're going Trump\nBut it was one of those things that made me think he's got a whim early in the evening [noise] but anyway\nI mean it doesn't matter if they win by one seat or by twenties seeds wants the when\nThey have control of the house they have control of all the committees and who knows what they'll do now if they don't have a big margin\nIf they don't have a big margin\nIn the house [noise] um\nIt would be tough for them to ram through a lot of stuff because unlike in the Senate you know where you get a hundred people were talking for a hundred and thirty five you get a lot of minds that can be you know different and\nEven though it's become so partisan they usually votes or along party lines it could be difficult but once they when they have control and who knows maybe Nancy Pelosi's in church\nBut if they do win and I'm just saying they really only about sixty percent chance\nI think of taking back the house if they do win again it will be by a single digit majority\nThey do take back the house but be prepared for the left to call that a mandate\nBe prepared for them to call that the blue wave be prepared for them to call that a rejection of Donald Trump the media will do that when I say the left I mean the media and the Democratic party\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nManchester New Hampshire teen is recovering in Massachusetts hospital after police say he led state troopers on a three state car chase before stabbing a

reading uh an analyst report on oil and thirty three small and medium sized drilling companies\nLost three point nine billion dollars in the first half of twenty Eighteen we've got this resurgence of shale right now we're talking about like domestic shale it's on the rise yeah but I don't know how much longer can continue\nAt this price I I think you've got to get oil prices at Seventy five maybe even eighty in order to make domestic productions profit or it's not going to continue they're not making money they're not going to do it\nRight and I know I I mean yeah yeah well we are losing money but we'll make it up and volume right right right I'm going to happen um eat eat that worries me because I Do like our independence\nWell and you know at some point you might say okay if if we're going to be we really want to be energy independent that Saudi oil that you reference yeah say well you know what we're going to tax it where to put a tariff on it because\nWe we want high we want more productive you don't want to be buying stuff from your enemies\nBy now that that that's it's a national security right then I was the whole purpose behind the steel and aluminum tariffs exactly you know you you don't want to not be in the business of producing I imagine it all of a sudden Canada and Saudi Arabia said we're not going to sell you any oil period yeah\nYou know it it's a self inflicted wound though 'cause they're they're hurting themselves\nI get it what are homeowners doing with home equity loans don't show me everybody's borrowing big on the house\nWell we think they're about to buy their border point four trillion dollars which is a record amount of ... kept home equity gym more than we saw back in two thousand six and two thousand and seven\nAnd we suspect my we were thinking now that the amount of equity is so great you're going to see people using it for home improvement yeah to buy a car to to pay for college education\nYeah oh that's okay as long as they just don't go too far because that home equity is sitting there you want to borrow on it okay you're going to stimulate the economy by borrowing on it but I just hope you don't end up underwater\nWell and that's the thing ... you know the big problem gymnast so many people there you're in your fifties you still have a mortgage yeah yeah it ended up retiring and still having a lot of\nNow I Know
