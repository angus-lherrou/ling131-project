they win it is over but if they don't win we're definitely going back to Fenway I'm Sorry I had to defeat his attitude for a minute there I think\nThat's got to the general consensus is a lot of people believe that the red Sox probably a ...\nProbably won't win [noise] um\nBut we all thought they wouldn't win at all Danny\nAll at all yeah I mean I think that was kind of the thought was especially this what sixteen runs last night [laughter]\nMoving the sixteen to one you seven nothing at one point and you change your start throwing the ball the into game three yeah people kind of thought okay it was a throwaway game and how does this happen to the Yankees not that I care a they're pitching is as bad as us as the red Sox okay so it's\nTwo officers who can get a hold of the baseball better in a single game\nAnd the red Sox prove that boy they're offered the hitting was ridiculous and stat that I never knew to do it nobody has ever hit to the cycle in the playoffs really so last night\n... with the red Sox became the first player ever to wait for the cycle in the playoffs\nThat's never happened to never had any major league baseball has not\nCould you explain to the listeners what hitting for the sighting of a say so basically you have to get a single a double a triple in a home run all in one game a it is something that happens on average I'd say you know two or three maybe four times a season across all in ... wrecked\nA has never happened any major league baseball playoffs and uh last night for the first time it has\nThat's crazy that's so cool\nBut so cool

I'm I'm guessing it was an office tasks I had it gets I think in the office him and do work harder than men that that's what they were focusing on ... and they said that went in complete ten percent more work than their male ...\nAnd there yet and uh they're not getting any money for it yeah and as a reward for their productivity women get no\nExtra money nothing nothing you've done to give it to the guys so drag is rolling in the do much for the rich and you get nothing and I'm doing all the work of just getting out of money I'm Glad it's all men over on this this this place because you know\nWe we we everybody's the same\nEveryone's the same and women also are better at multitasking which you know multi tasking I don't even know of anyone can really do that any way I mean as far as just doing something halfway then yeah and you can multitask a lot of things I mean you're not giving a hundred percent to every single thing but you're checking boxer\nShy can multitask like if I'm doing stuff around the house that is good I can if I've got projects that can be done at a day I can bounce between four\nAnd get it done and I actually planted out that way so like if I'm painting something that's drying okay while that's drying 'cause you know latex paint dry squared yeah while that's drawing I'm going to go over here and do this and that and I can multitask\nWell I can do I I got to be honest with rare for guys they seem like they he railed and yeah like when when my husband's working on a project he needs to only focus on that one thing he's going to do it with excellence and it's great but if you're like hey can you\nSo I just looked at me for a second while you're doing you know painting adding up something or you know paying bills or whatever and like just one second he said I Can't listen to him I didn't let me just finish that and I'll give you my attention in a second\nIf I'm In the middle of something that's really a delicate or something then I Will say no but I mean like I Know I I generally don't focus on that one project unless that's the only thing to do because I Do like the balance between them that's\nIts good media to this I think that makes a difference as a good thing is you know\nAll the time of the Miami and get this done and important yeah it is\nIt's like you have to be able to answer the phone and do this they don't check the messy\nPeddling a bicycle while I'm behind this console the same time\nSo fat itself it\nWas driven as you know we're we have another miniature okay ah the sticking with the office thing yeah a lotta coworkers I'm covering each other for other people go on vacation right actually coming up with all the holidays and everything yeah I'm fifty three percent of Americans say covering for a co worker is very stressful\nLike they dried it they almost resent their coworkers for going away\nJim glad Danny's on this guy he was totally goes on vacation guess what happens to me twice store\nAnd I tend to employees work on increases by a third when someone's out\n[noise] I don't you know it's funny when I was in a circumstance where that made a difference and it's been a long time um I didn't resent the person I resented the company\nI didn't resent the ... you're very you're grown up and that's a that's a natural way to handle that but I usually aren't the person like horse do rag leaves like why am I going to do that right I think Haitians together and get sick together\nRight cause they named streets after you weigh one\nMa homes and I'm All right um I think we're out of time here is um\nYou have to go back and do some work for Greg idea yeah and I'll make sure that in early today to let them go do it yeah music up the slack show the view from the other side was Suzanne Louis you're listening to the gym ... show your safe space\nWhere\nYou're at the gym\n... show taxing Hi this is Jim ... and you may have noticed that I lost a significant amount of useless wait I didn't go to a doctor I didn't go to a personal trainer here's the guy who helped me do it Baba from superior waste and recycling\nI just wanted to remind everyone about they drop off center we have off\nCamera street still easy for people to bring their junk yes we designed mix and make it easy for pickups cars and mini van still ten cents a pound yes only ten cents per pound and no appointment meat it are you still open early and late yes\nOpen at seven close at six and we are open on Saturday till five\nSo it's on ... street off Cambridge where two Ninety and one forty six me yes easy to get\nA dumpsters pickups and a drop off setter superior really does make it easy\nCall us at five Seventy nine seven four or five seven nine seven or eight or a or you can go to ...

you know Orrin Hatch of Utah as senators stepping down this year\nHe was he asks Ginsberg he said if a court might reasonably conclude that a small business in a majority black city\nThat hired fifty seven white employees ... zero black employees over a period of years was discriminatory\nThough that was one of the questions during her confirmation do you think that's discrimination\nAnd\nShe kinda dodge answering the question because the question would get at quotas in terms of affirmative action\nWell here's the kicker hatch pointed out that was in fact her own record of clerk ship hiring in her Thirteen Years on the U.S court of appeals for the DC circuit the same court that Brett Kavanaugh was in the Thirteen years she served\nThere she never hired a black clerk want to hear something funny since then she has hired one\nOK so\nA sex offender can drive a Halloween truck\nI mean a a an ice cream truck\nThey can't do a job like that\nThey can\nCan doubt candy now remember us

years remember an inconvenient truth\nTo that movie come out Danny I'm\nLike oh six maybe let's see sixteen basically I made I was going to be underwater two thousand six two thousand six Al Gore said

here folks\nWe had a mini ice age\nWe had a mini ice age\nLike you know the ice age you think of what the cave men and the and the ... and all that many ice age\nWas colder than normal\nWe weren't

[noise] much bigger than we are much bigger\n[noise] I keep I keep falling back on that but I just think there's subsequent generations that get indoctrinated into this thinking and as you said your class watched an inconvenient truth I mean they're they're playing in in schools Tom they're indoctrinated people and the point is\nAl Gore failed in in in in his assessment that ten years from two thousand six Manhattan would be underwater then in in twenty sixteen he said well it's because of the measures we've taken to reduce greenhouse gases since then\nI I no no absolutely not your prediction was flat wrong\nOr the last I look China and India are polluting more than they've ever polluted yeah\nExactly exactly they are they are polluting more and they are always excluded from these agreements or they're given a benchmark in the agreement that means nothing\nIn terms of reducing so called\nGreenhouse gases\nSo yeah All right well I just wanted to bounce it up you because\nI I just think Tom now we're going to hear this one and in twelve years you and I are going to be talking then it's gonna be oh remember twelve years ago when the UN told us right now we were going to

I tell you what\nSteve came the closest to the correct answer here is the correct answer no I I Know John here is the correct answer medical marijuana\nIs regulated\nUnder the department of public health\nSo the department of public health regulates labs that will test the medical marijuana\nRecreational marijuana comes from the cannabis control commission\nIn their labs will test\nMe the pot to be produced for commercial\nOr recreational use not medical I'm not kidding that's the only difference they're going to test it for the same thing they're going to check it out in the same way\nSteve came the closest to the correct answer its bureaucracy when I was on\nConnecting point last friday night I should put a link to the to the show because the the show is archived now and you can watch it we talk about medical marijuana are we talking about recreational marijuana why we don't have a lesser and in North Hampton\nOr a recreational pot shops open\nAnd it's because of this and supposedly the commission is going to me very very soon and get this all straightened out but might play sons from the Republican en masse live he got to the bottom of the story\nWhich is\nHe didn't say it like we did but it's bureaucracy\nIt's ridiculous it's insane\nThey just\nLook the cat's out of the bag no matter how you feel about pot or whatever it is here okay yes I Know there's new studies out suggesting that if you use marijuana before your brain is fully developed you're going to be a yard so much higher risk\nFor psychiatric ... a ... is shoes later in life yes get all of that um but it's full steam ahead on this and I my opinion is once you're full steam ad on something like this just do it\nBut the revenue that we all expected [noise]\nI mean really the revenue that we all expect it from this stuff okay there's some from medical the revenue we all expected from from this stuff we said let's let's cast are lot let's have gambling let's have medical marijuana will make a lot of money off of it the only the only folks sending any money\nInto the state coffers is MGM in Springfield that's it that's it\nWe can't get out of our own way can you can you picture a business\nI'm your own company where you work now I Know we we all make complaints about our employer and we say you know they should do this like this they just listen to us as you do this like this okay I I agree and I do the same thing\nBut for the most part a business makes decisions when it comes to revenue that usually they're on there or not to make upon their on the money but you tell a business hey if you guys get moving\nAnd you get this a recreational pot store up and running you're going to make a lot of money is going to be ready you know it's going to be great\nDo you think they'd be dragging their feet\nLike the cannabis control commission see can we get a job on that commission here we do nothing commission well I mean I I Know you have to be careful and and\nUh watch what you do but I mean but do you though I mean they legalized the plants and people have a growing in their backyard they're not testing that stuff I mean look it's not like a it's it's not like we're talking about some white powdery substance where you could put God Knows what into it\nI'm ...
