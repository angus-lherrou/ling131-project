our news director John ... joins us now where the story on uh Springfield but it's a story that's got\nShall we say an interest for anyone who lives anywhere good morning John\nGrading sir how may I help you are well I Need the background on this case about Springfield courthouse and when I talk about Springfield scored out some talking about handing county district and superior court that shall we say John monstrosity of a building that looks like\nYou know the ... every night mayor you could ever have about the way they build buildings in the seventies right well\nThey did this building was built for I think if memory serves Seventeen and a half million dollars back in Nineteen Seventy three yeah and uh oddly enough the original court house which is next door\nA cost a two hundred and forty four thousand dollars to build back in the Eighteen sixties it would probably take you that much money now\nTo do the air quality study in the in the current building yeah it has it has never been respected it's a big block building yeah it it was it was state of the art back in Nineteen Seventy three it has never been state of the yard after that\nThey've got all kinds of air quality air conditioning heating problems in the building\nYou take your your your life in your hands when you go into the elevator [laughter] uh you got big problems in fact if the governor is listening or the lieutenant governor is is listening lieutenant governor knock down this building\nTear down to one tear down that wall kind of like Ronald Reagan it ah I didn't want to plagiarize no it's All right you get I mean he's dead\nSo I'm well here's here's the deal or John I'm going to take exception with what you said I think that building was state of the yard for about Fifteen minutes\nI Would say that you know but it reminds me of the typical seventies buildings were stirs police department it's like the same guy designed both buildings let's have no windows let's have a lot of concrete\nLet's make it look like something out of Woody Allen sleep or which was a movie about the future\nBut that's about it he just just not a a pretty building and yes like you haven't spent a lot of time in there is just awful it it no windows it's dark it's you know and contrast that with when you go into war stirs new courthouse Worcester county\nDistrict in superior court much nicer okay so but the reason we're bringing this up is a state officials are saying we're doing\nEnvironmental testing\nIn the building of the air now\nThis comes on\nThe heels of a a really great guy a judge William boil and a John we both spoken fondly of judge boil a here nice guy\nYou're proven that yeah okay there's a connection between this building and being year will make you sick\nNow I just don't think there's any conclusive evidence just because we had two judges in the same office develop a alas some people would say well Jim there's your evidence right there\nUm someone in the article said those are Powerball odds I don't think so I really don't think so it happens\nAnd no one has been able to conclusively say okay this is what's causing it as opposed to um when people used to work with is best is when it was free flowing in the air\nYou know I'm OK ... it's pretty clear but if you have a masters in a building it doesn't mean you're going to get ... you know if that his masters is contained\nAnd it's not in the air you don't have anything to worry about it someone you disturb it you have a problem but I I probably I think\nI think that part of what it might be as well as the or the federal courthouse up the street that looks like something out of a you know that blondes Vegas\nThat you've got in and they got MGM you get MGM across the street everybody is looking at that every day and looking at everybody got what the shiny new a bike and oh yeah and shiny new car and there's there's there's there are ... versus ...\nBody spent a lot of time in court houses are

me ask you about the China stock market goes Mike Pompeo is over there right now and I was talking with my national correspondent about that visit what what's going on\nSo ah overnight the Chinese stock market fell about three point seven percent or keep in mind that the Chinese stock market is already down by about Fifteen yeah this year um they're really facing you know are a number of different\nIssues uh but the big one is obviously trade and that President Trump the policies that have slowed down the economy there\nWhat the Chinese government did a over the weekend is\nA loose in the reserve requirements so you know how our banks here in the United states if you put in a deposit there they have to keep some of that and they lend you have to rest a Chinese banks are the same ah when times get tough you know one of the things that the government can do is they can say okay you can keep a little bit less\nOf your cash on hand a which is good for the short term but potentially dangerous for the long\nTerm exactly um so you know effectively if the Chinese government overnight face like pumped billions of dollars in cash back into their economy um but you know it's kind of

sanity\nOf the chaos that was going on in the capital if we learn one thing from this whole Kavanaugh saying we learned that the press is firmly in the tank for the Democrats there's no other way\nTo get around it we also learned that don't quote the ACLU anymore don't don't bother and the reason\nIs because they had they spent a million dollars on defeating judge Kavanaugh and yet there was no explanation\nFor why they didn't want him on the court like they didn't point to one of his\nThree hundred decisions in the D.C court of appeals the second most important\nSecond most important in

where the where the press really really failure and\nTaught Christine Fordham at fashion especially given that many sexual assault victims don't remember all the details of what happened\nPeople kept saying on the media that he missed ... or ... minutes ridiculing\nCritical part when he was doing was pointing out what anybody could see when they watch protests and which is that we're a major holes that were major flaws every major contradictions I actually thought that a lot of the media should have been pointing out themselves and you didn't see that you didn't see people going through and looking\nAt her story which changed over time multiple times they never were able to corroborate any aspect of it they spent all their time looking at ice throwing at parties in your book things and they should have been actually doing what he did that they should have been pointing out that she had flaws in her testing well if\nYou look at the transcript you could say yes he is he is saying that if we're going to scrutinize media than a\nPolitical system's going to scrutinize to nominate let's look at the accuser but the tone for it to me was unmistakable he thought it\nWas about the town and the problem with the talent and all the things you're saying now ... hundred percent true about missing a fair cover just problems and test was that you you know that he's speaking also the people\nWho believe her and who also have had their own experiences so it looks as though he is mocking them personally\nAnd that is one of the problems with President Trump and and his talent and when he addresses problems like this that table interpret it one way and and and it's harmful can be harmful previously said he found her credible which was much more than a lot of people thought when they got it sorry to hear some credit for that I have one he was ... was mocking in New York Times reporter\nAnd then you explain that again it just it just said well a lot of people and\nOrder with his ability as a judge Janine I'm ...\nNow that reporter with disabilities by the way I'm there's evidence of Trump\nMaking the same voice in the same thing\nAbout other people so but let's go back to
