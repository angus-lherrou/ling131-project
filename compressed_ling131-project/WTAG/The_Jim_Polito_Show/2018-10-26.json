the grocery store\nI'm then only Seventeen percent that wanted to do the online grocery shopping yeah you know that's\nInteresting because as much as I find grocery shopping sometimes to really be a tedious\nChore um I've never really done that like do the ordering a online 'cause I just felt like well I Want to see this stuff I I I Want to I Want to see this up for a minute\nSo you know and

the prison you know you're in a vehicle sucking in diesel fuel\nDanny I Want your opinion on this and I don't know if Steve too busy to talk about this Curt Schilling wasn't invited to be part of the world series first pitch ceremony and I've read a lot of different\nStories about how this all came down to the red Sox are trying to portray it as it was just an oversight critically overlay\nBut no way no they didn't want him there so legitimately [laughter] ... so here's the thing I Know Curt Schilling\nUm expresses a lot of his political views so and uh ESPN didn't want him expressing\nAnd he was political views and make comments about transgender Z and things like that [noise] um he went bankrupt with this company and screw the state of Rhode Island probably part of the reason why ... got the paw socks goes Rhode Island was reluctant to give money to a private entity again\nBut he the guy had the bloody sock\nYou can't take any of that away from him you know it's one thing to say well you can't have Pete Rose there he ... he ... he was placing bets on the sport okay\nCurt Schilling hasn't really hasn't done anything to ah hurt the integrity of baseball and he was an integral part of the two thousand four world\nSeries championship after eighty six dry years for the red Sox\nSay a Curt Schilling sympathizer I Am not yeah uh me uh but uh he kind of put it best when he said never once as one of his teammates come out and called him a racist or homophobic and he's never had an issue with his teammates yeah he may have these beliefs that he kind of kept\nTo himself during his playing days yeah since then he's kind of come out in that kind of people know how he feels yeah he definitely should have been\nGets screwed by John ...\nFree and the politically correct Red Sox which now on the bottom you know he owns the Boston Globe I mean this is all what virtue signaling huh Steve what's your thought on this\nWell I mean I'll take sort of Curt Schilling out of it for the moment this is an organization who\nLiterally loves these pre game ceremonies loves then this is like there are they like the pregame ceremony more than the actual game have things like organized down to a tea and then they come to this one they're like\nOh yeah well we were just winging it you know I we told anybody who wants to come from the fourteen they can come wait wait what is your first world series in eighty six years yeah celebrating that team and then you're just sort of like we see anybody can come if they want to yeah bowl I don't believe that what a bunch of water bunch\nYeah what about the ... yeah the guards Churchill and got the sort of scrutiny is he really did not a sympathizer either for that guy at all no but I Know that like I said yeah I I'm I'm not either oh of course for me to be fired by ESPN is kind of a badge of courage\nUh as far as I'm concerned but you know the the folks from the red Sox talk about talk about backpedaling I mean man it's like they're going there they're going backwards for a pop up fly into into the center field wall that's how that's how much they're back pedaling\nThe ... originally they said oh we just invited to players\nAnd then you know other people called and said hey let like can be part of it than you know I never got around to Curt Schilling\nCome on\nYou know it you know what it really does it really bothers me because the red Sox around the cost of a of a World Series championship right now\nAnd to just pull this crap you know changed the name of yucky way by the globe make it even more or less the radical ... and and this kind of stuff\nIt just it really it's like you know what guys he trying to make me not like you\nAre you really trying to make me not like you I understand\nProtecting your product and and the Boston Red Sox are a product just like the show is\nBut come on\n... what did they think we're going to happen people are gonna boo Curt Schilling\nDoes that is that what they were worried about say they were gonna boo courage yelling or we don't we didn't want to be associated with his ...\nWe have we don't want to wear right we we don't really agree with what he stands for and so that's why we're we're not which is again putting yourself ahead of\nOf and suppliers everybody involved and the thing it's it's all about the red Sox you know that they put their own personal politics and priorities ahead of everything else that's going on which is annoying typically yes it's very annoying\nI mean look at the place the guy deserves in history of course\nYou know as Johnny Damon would say what was it in no for we were just a bunch of what was it idiots idiot idiot yeah we're just a bunch of idiots but Curt Schilling went out there and yeah the bloody sock and even though what did he sell it after that or something you know I Can't remember but he went out there and he had a bloody sock that was a real\nThat was such a representation if you want to know what that year was like for the Sox like a bloody sock and he still pitch and what was it what did they done staple some tendon back together and his ankle\nYeah they had some suitors staples down and then he thought the ghost of the game it didn't hold and it wrapped\nAnd he's playing any still you know he still throwing rockets over the plate come on\nYou know it's interesting to look at it like you know everybody gives the NFL such a hard time for putting the politics ... into it and I I I think this might be a little bit different in terms of this has nothing to do with the players like if you're thinking to yourself I don't want to watch the red Sox anymore because their owner is you know X Y and Z that's fine but\nI Will say that I don't think this has anything to do with a monkey bats and David Price and Chris Sale and all the other oh no on the team that have gotten them to this point you know so it is to me important to separate the two and you know you can still tell John

it's just like the the guy who shot Steve skill east I mean it was a Bernie supporter I don't think that anything to do with it but you didn't hear Republicans say that maybe they just should\nYou know sometimes they say you you you got to fight fire with fire and that's the way the Dems fight I don't know I don't know speaking of fighting fire with fire just got a great media advisory from community action people helping people about Jim McGovern\nJim McGovern touts importance of headstart\nSix hundred thousand dollars in federal funds and twenty thousand from Berkshire Bank newly committed for a double you see a sea Webster project\nCongressman James McGovern toured worst or community action councils headstart renovation project located in one sixteen schools screening Webster today and announced his success and securing six hundred thousand dollars for the federal administration of children\nAnd their families to support the project\nAren't listen to a quote from him this is a big deal\nHead start is one of the best programs we have for breaking the cycle of poverty that prevents far too many students from living up to their God given potential\nFor every dollar we invest in head start our country realizes nine dollars in benefits through increased earnings and decreased reliance on safety net programs this grant together with a half a million dollars we secured and two twenty seven team\nIs a huge investment in the children and families in Worcester county I'm proud of my advocacy to secure this vital funding and thankful to our team of local state federal and nonprofit partners who brought this vision to life OK let's just quickly go through what's wrong completely wrong with everything he said there\n'cause I'll use his own logic to against him okay for every dollar we invest in head start our country realizes nine dollars in benefits through increased earnings and decrease reliance on safety net programs well if that's true\nIf we can get a nine hundred percent return on our investment\nCan we put a trillion dollars into head start\nI mean if I came to you and said I've got an investment here and you ... you're going to get the you're going to make nine hundred percent on your money when you be a fool not to invest or well wait a minute [laughter]\nWho would be the fool because when you say at the gym that doesn't make any sense how am I going to make nine hundred percent on this\nHe's saying just like this is the common refrain Nancy Pelosi said remember when she talked about food stamps and welfare how much economic\nFor every dollar spent on food stamps I don't know what the government gets like three to four or five dollars back\nReally that doesn't make any sense how can you hear something like that and then say oh that's great that's like in Nineteen eighty four the the the story Nineteen eighty four by George Orwell tell people that and tell them that it's great and you just don't use any logic to think about it one other thing in this\nThe typical McGovern typical Richie Neal um he says head start is one of the best programs we have for breaking the cycle of poverty\nNo it isn't\nNo no see it is not you know one head start is\nHead start is this\nYou created the welfare state with the great society with Johnson\nAnd so you made families less and less responsible for their own children you even incentivized\nFathers to be absentee going to break up the family\nAnd now this is your fix for it right [noise]\nAnd let's talk about breaking the cycle of poverty Jim McGovern you opposed\nThe program at the worst or housing authority developed by re Mariano a fellow Democrat someone who grew up in public housing you opposed his program that was voluntary that helped to get people out of public housing\nAnd they should still be considered a potentially destructive devise\nA show a it yeah you would think that if there was somebody that was so outraged about what's going on yeah they would they would want to do some damage or the other potential thing is as well is that\nCould this be an outside influence their stride once again a so called election meddling trying to disrupt as much as they can now and that has to be examined as well\nYeah I just somebody asked me that last night gym do you think it's the Russians and I said no excuse sloppy for the Russians yeah because whoever drop these things off is going to get caught\nAnd then if they even if that person or was totally just given them by the Russians and paid say here drop these offer us no questions asked okay fine um but they're still going to lead it's still going to lead back to the Russians they're not that sloppy\nThey're not die and the other thing that's interesting and this is well I'm Wondering whether it is an individual or group because uh we had post do packages\nSent to different areas to ah to of course a New York and to Delaware and to the Obamas are out to Los Angeles to Maxine Waters\nAnd they arrived pretty much around the same time well how do you coordinated deliberate to Los Angeles and to Delaware I and I I mean so it leads me to believe that it's a possibility that there it could be a group involved maybe an okay you're going to mail it from the west coast will mail they you know what I mean\nYeah no could finally how long do you think do you think after this weekend will have somebody in custody\n[noise] I think so yeah I really think so I Do too yeah they're\nThey're working hard on this postal connection down in Florida right now and I think that uh the analysis of the devices themselves will lead them to where the materials may have come from yeah I think we may get some action by the end of the weekend\nBills him for our good friend bill you have a

man in radio and master of all millennials from the Armstrong advisory group\nMike Armstrong good morning sir wondering hey Amazon\nEarnings uh they're they're doing All right in the ... household a I keep getting these notices a package will arrive and I'm like I didn't know where to this everybody everybody's got the\nPassword now the whole family no good you know you got to nip that in the bud but I'm working on it and I'm working on it\nI'm so first off let's just call out that Amazon has been one of the best performing stock in the world over the last several years\nEarnings report this quarter was not\nGreat I really would earnings were okay but\nTheir projections for the fourth quarter which is pretty important quarter or you know that our Christmas shopping of course up here and of course projections are pretty important there and they just showed a little bit of a disappointment in comparison to what most people were expecting the stock price now before the market opens is down eight and a half percent free markets\nUm you know this could be probably the biggest drop they've seen since twenty fourteen and their stock price that it would bring their shares back to where they're trading back in May of this year wow I'm\nSo we'll see how investors react but\nYou know I I I was personally a little bit surprised about this or not expect to slow down a lot of their areas are still doing really well and they're still very very profitable at this point it's just that big the celebration in terms of what we anticipated for their growth Hercules four and twenty nine teen\nThey're still making money hand over fist though they're a big mess and there are\nEarning more money on advertising than they used to so they're kind of eating a little bit into Google and Facebook the here and they're they're doing a lot\nOf stuff really well but they seemed to be slowing down a little bit in terms of their revenue projections which are clearly surprised a lot of investors\nYou can't tell Wall Street one thing and I have another thing happen it's if it's bad and I'm not expect to get away from them even if you're still a monster behemoth\nYep so I then Google actually put out some results that weren't that great a after the market close yesterday too so right now the NASDAQ effected open a whole two percent down today so if you know obviously Wednesday\nWe had that terrible day yeah yeah we had in pretty good recovery and today it's looking like it's going to be pretty ugly out there again the soy hum\nOkay uh about our GDP\nSo GDP we're going to get a reading at eight thirty this morning so about half an hour a is expected to be very strong coming up at three point three percent of the annual lives rate that's down from last quarter where we had a four point two percent gain but it's expected to be\nAnd I'm looking at this you know there's two ways that you're going to be looking at this one you know if it comes in very very strong\nThan the architecture might react poorly because they might say well gee now are definitely getting interest rate moves from the fed and you know that could knock the stock market down even further\nOn the other hand if it comes in really poorly that could be a pretty bad sign for Republicans going into this mid term election if Democrats can come in and say hey look you did this whole pack bill you promised huge GDP Growth and it came in at two percent or something like that\nThat would be bad heading into the midterm elections for Republicans so it will be a very it's a pretty important as far as the GDP report go yeah yeah the one that's two weeks before the election\nIs important really is what have you done for me lately All right so uh I'll be paying attention today at ten o'clock\nMike Armstrong master of all millennials folks GDP report out in a little over half an hour or so you'll have all the analysis\nThanks very much body by Jake gear\nDon't go anywhere when we return after

disingenuous\nMy opponent to say that if we weren't doing it because he knew we took that practice from Suffolk we implemented in Worcester for the first time ever\nAllow right\nChallenger also said there's an issue of ethics in the in the west or county da's office and they also made the accusation that there aren't enough minorities working it's not a real true reflection of the community here what are you what do you want to\nAh that's absolutely false and he knows better on that as well look I've yes five applications are attorneys drugs from people of color since I get in it's hard to recruit minorities the pool listen to it but we're trying to you need to get at a sure\nBut we were actively recruiting if the law schools I talked to the kids ... and say oh men and women of color if you want to change the world become a lawyer I tell them about the program they have at UMass repeal except a public job\nYou can get fifty percent tuition\nAnd you know ... we've had minorities comes with the office one of the problems is a it's a very small pool\n... I have lost a minority applicants to higher paying jobs\nAnd but what we have done in other parts of the law is the first as a woman of color is a supervisor in his office the first ever head of the state police detective unit ... is a man of color\nAnd I talked to some people in my office has to be made these accusations that were offended by that they said this is a great place to work it's a great climate and you know any and they need to say it would say because that was actually absolute nonsense and he knows that and that\nUm what about the question of the ethics ethics Jim here's the thing they are ethics of fine we follow the rules are professional conduct with her in the alley people case what we do on a daily basis when you ... ... ... ethics when you follow the rules professional conduct no\nAvoid publicly condemning someone what make sure you protect someone right to have it so much Rachel at trial ... professional ... industry six and three eight you're in compliance with that you're not violating net suppressing it you know with regards to the opioid crisis some people talk talk talk talk they walk the walk\nThis is what we'd go in with regards to that as well\nYou know he's referring to the attorney general let the attorney general found in that case was no official within the ... no official within the da's office acted with intent to keyed in fear of struck\nTom DeLay rented it with the prosecution in that case no one asked to reduce any charges were dismissed and he charges no charges were reduced to dismiss us everything I mean everything Joe\nWas preserved ... sensitive Middlesex is is that the prosecution of that case and like I said we falls out rules professional conduct that state\nI'm not just in a advocate I'm a minister of justice we don't publicly condemn someone with a statement\nIn the end of the day all of that so much this is about you'll you'll price crisis and the fundamental\nBeliefs that I have a we treat people with compassion dignity and respect we steer indirect meant to treat you know shame humiliate embarrass people we help people and people like former surgeon general Vivek Murthy said we have removed the stigma\nAnimals compassion that involves treating people with respect dignity compassion for what we know is a disease it's not a moral feeling it's not a character flaw in ... we have pilot programs throughout the county and Fitch lemons when she got and it was ...\nWe if someone will accept treatment and they get arrested possession of everyone everyone Smith whose son or daughter the or doesn't matter who they are we won't prosecute them if they'll accept treatment\nThat's what my office is done we've received a one point three million dollars in grants you tend to governor the governor they focused on us they said it's working in which the county they are just that money\nWe have these pilot programs we have a lot of stuff going on I ...
