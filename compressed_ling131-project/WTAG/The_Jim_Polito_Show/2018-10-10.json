throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something following an Iraq than what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you\nOh my entire life you have\nFrom my from my early childhood I felt there is something following me I had an experience when I was about seven years old and my back yard my parents were both inside the house and I came in house screaming because some some thing set in my name into my ear and it made my ear vibrate why\nThat remain so loud now have you ever you sell the voice have you felt threatened or do you feel secure with whatever into these doing this\nYou know it's kind of mix um occurring I feel secure and then there are times when I feel like it I don't ever feel like it's trying to harm me but I Do feel like there's certain people in my life that it goes into effect in wave\nAnd interesting well let me tell you in the in the short time we have left\nMy experience is that if these entities aren't hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was gonna say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's a who I mean am what something is following I think that if someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guide and and you know that's looking over you know

because they're even the economy's doing very well um there are a lot of people that their finances are out of control ... out of control and really that the highest\nPeople age group and the less young women feel at most rally millennials feel more overwhelmed by their financial situation than any other generation and that the young women feel at the most and and so they're just trying to figure out a way to get their money under control\nYoung women yeah OK because they're out spending money on stupid stuff can probably you know or I Need this outfit and it costs a lot of money\nAnd try to get this cream which is supposed to make me ... yeah it's really just like the same thing that's in the generic skin lotion\nYeah you're right I mean that stuff and then you add it to just even going out with friends\nAnd girlfriends they really are and so there's a financial planner and that was explaining every day in and they said this is a way you can feel more control your finances so okay first you want to acknowledge that you have a money issue because some people don't actually know that this\nKind of like um if I'm an alcoholic and I go to the meeting and I say Hi everybody I'm Jim Hi Jim and I'm an alcoholic yeah yeah because you're spending under control okay well I'm not spending out here in general but\nUm but that's what they need to do you know I mean ... money is just a math problem and there's a simple thanks to that you just have to get that under control I got this financial planner also goes on to say that if you haven't sent money issues spend the day being mindful\nOf you're spending and this is very true I was shocked at how much money are we spending I'm at a time in my life when I when I Would write things down right down like what are we spending every day\nI was shocked that you are actually spending money [laughter] younger now right now\nYeah yeah they get that in the area\nThat have died yeah you and David yeah oh yeah well I I Can't even fit in my house and they might have just so much money ... money to the cash everywhere okay so I didn't you into that like write down what am I spending today\nBecause even if you you grab lunch every day and you're thinking oh it's five bucks yeah guess what that adds up\nYeah I Know and you know off the and this and that I Know it all it all leads the way you\nKnow what is the the killer of most people but my purchases\nWhat purchasing micro hurts your Mike Rowe purchased so small little things you don't think it's a big deal it's like oh you know what I'm going to get a copy on my lunch or a dancer now a little you know I owe and you've got to buy whatever it's all these little oh these shirts only ten dollars I Need I Need to get it in order to set in\nYour dying fifty ten dollar shirts and it's like okay well stop you know all those little parts of it all\nOut and buying a a Ferrari\nWell not really I was gonna say or just budgeting like I have three hundred dollars to spend on clothes instead of every candidate can fail\nYou find that's not good at it okay I get that All right so good we're ready for the holidays were ready for spending for the holiday yeah so let's go to the holidays okay because some people get really stressed out about holidays in one of the things is money but it's not all about money so if you aren't getting a little stressed does even thinking about the holidays or\nYou can start planning now you can plan you can set a gifting budget yeah you know that's a good idea because when you credit cards again\nUm and then also another way to really embrace the holidays and not get stressed a schedule the traditions that you don't want to skip do that now put him on your calendar you love the tree lighting and ... you know I get it you know if you really love going out\nIn a way that you know Jack and Sally ... best friends and you really want to make sure you go in and go to a restaurant and have a nice dinner yeah right on your calendar start feeling that counter out now so you can work around it later\nOkay I get that that makes sense the budgeting before the holidays make sense that makes sense yeah no I I usually come up with a number that I can work with the ... million ... million I come up with a number and then I Try to get everything into it okay good\nAnd then again you can do to east dressed for the holiday start planning\nNow go away and not be with any\nFamily Christmas now I'm In banking ... months to spare\nAnd baked goods can be stored in the Fraser after three months so if you want to get ahead of it and you just have to serve and I saw it and started late I Do\nKnow people who do that especially like when they do a lot of the Italian cookies they do a load of them they cook them in advance and they freeze them and then that way\nThey got 'em right and then you can arrange them put them in the pretty cellophane paper you know the color and then I'll take one last minute and then you'll get to all of those\nAnd they also helps with the budget it you know what I mean because you don't have that ... you said I ... and all that stuff you know what to expect it bothers expense and they get better but when it's on sale and take advantage and\nLaughing and if you want to see just stress the holiday starting out and get your house in in order now's the time was on yeah kind\nOf in many times to get my house in order\nYeah we're not talking about where I live [laughter] get your house in order so get the house in order now that way I'm not doing it you know what you know what kills me that's the greatest expression ever\nWhen you when you're complaining to someone about all the holidays and they say\nYou know Jim it comes on the same day every yeah right yeah and I don't usually complained about being late for the holidays because I Do try to plan but when somebody says you know comes on the same day every year it's not like all of a sudden somebody says okay next week we're

priest and called his victim who was in a nursing home at the time\nAnd was trying to get her to tell people that it wasn't Benjamin liquor raped her\nAlso while he's been in prison he has not attended sex offender treatment\nAnd the reason he is given is that in order to attend sex offender treatment you have to admit to your crime and he\nKeeps saying he's innocent so guess what\nYou're about to me you're maker\nYou won't you won't\nThat you raped and beat this woman back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe DNA proves he did it don't give us any of this other crap you want to get out here's

everybody kind of shut up once the DNA evidence proved a now wasn't him\nThen he tried to say well the DNA evidence it was a fix it was this was that now won't attend sex offender treatment while in prison won't admit that he did it maintains his innocence okay I maintain that you stay behind bars\nI maintain that you stay behind bars a five five four zero three Ninety forty six so you don't have

to say the man himself Bucky bleeping didn't dent throughout the first pitch\nAnd uh he was the guy who hit the game winning home run in the Nineteen Seventy eight a Elise tie breaker game\nAgainst the red Sox at Fenway Park wow but you know what the sweet irony gets even sweeter over the red Sox win the sweet irony gets even sweeter here it is a last\nI'm reading this and the New York post\nA there was music playing in the red Sox are the visitors' locker room up in the Bronx\nAnd a writer around midnight guess what song started to play\nFrank Sinatra's New York New York they put it the red Sox put it on their celebration playlists now you may remember that Aaron Judge played the song on the speaker as he walked by the home clubhouse at Fenway Saturday Night\nA well more sweet irony I guess Danny based upon your\nYour calculations your forecast thing that we should enjoy this celebration as much as possible because we're not going to the world series\nI'm not going to say we're not going to the world series him saying that it is going to be more difficult I don't expect it to be you know a short series if it is going to happen it's going to be grind it out seven game is going to be games that they win big there's going to be games that they lose ugly\nAnd they're going to take a little bit of luck on their side kind of like they had to get the Yankees as much as the bullpen tried to blow it turn to the games again\nI'd have to leave that come out on top and not necessarily the same thing will happen again the address is because they're hitting oh they've hit all season so that's kind of been the most throughout the entire season is you know we're just going to hit the baseball country mile and\nEverybody's going to get ahead entirely heads and their their averages with runners and scoring position is just unbelievable that these are things that are hard to keep up the multiple series but they've done it so far this season okay\nAh who's the match up on the other side to any uh that would be the Milwaukee\nBrewers in the Los Angeles Dodgers some dodges are in the third straight ... yeah or the brewers are a bit of a surprise they were kind of a second half of the season surge uh got through the wild card game and to the LDS swept the if you got to put in the in in the U.S on the Rockies yeah then uh you know they\nYou know we were talking yesterday about the pay these guys get and that in football you don't get paid unless you play I mean most contracts you you got to play there's a lot of incentive baseball you sign a contract\nThat money is yours\nYou walk out of the you walk out of the dugout and ... [laughter]\nYeah you could literally leave your contract signing trip them going down the stairs yeah again and you're going to be a rich man the only thing\nIs you think about the baseball season Danny basically it starts in April and it finishes just before November first\nYes but you figure your average pictures just started going once every five days I'm not talking about pigeons argue with everybody else on the layers and ... there [noise]\nIt's a lot of work yes and no yeah I Know you're going to say you go all out in football you go a lot\nMore constant speed even something like a soccer or something like that while the locker yeah ball where you know baseball you can be ... if you looked at some of the players on the field last night not exactly a\nPro athletes I knew you were going to say that ah who's the guy who ... who's the\nFirst base and you don't even have to say that all you don't even have to say that I remember when Louis ... was a David well David Wells without threw a perfect game he was drunk I Know All right when we return more\nFrom the mob mob is not going to settle down and Jeff deal against Elizabeth Warren easy getting a bump you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space cell\nJim what you think I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help\nCoal eight five five four zero three nine eight or six\nHi Jim to lead over here when your family as more stuff and less room to store it in\nAnd uh it's gonna be great and Danny your production already is a you're not that excited that saying they're going to lose but\nYou know that excited pitching all at all yeah I think the top to bottom the extras probably have a better team it's been a good season for the red Sox I Hope they win but you know a wedding on me going back in New York Post today is saying what's wrong with the Yankees and what they need to do now to fix it\nSounds like the kind of headlines we you know we occasionally read nice nice to see a New York having to read that for once okay the mob continues continues\nTo try to exert pressure on us I'm telling you right now folks Democrats are desperate\nAnd Hillary Clinton is out there encouraging violence will get to that but right now I just want to address the Elizabeth Warren race\n[noise] gift deal says the voters are giving him a cabin up bump in the race versus Elizabeth Warren I don't know about that he doesn't have any numbers really to back it up but in other parts of the country not Massachusetts\nThere has been a cabinet bump means Suzie as some gap between Democrats and Republicans says we slide into the mid term\nThan less than a month I'm as we as we had that way there has been\nA narrowing of the gap between enthusiasm between Democrats and Republicans on yesterday you may remember I told you that fifty eight percent of independents disapprove of the way Democrats handled the Kavanaugh hearing\nFifty eight percent\nDisapproved of the way Democrats handled the cabin I hearing and you know what we should all disapprove of the way Hillary Clinton is handling yet Hillary Clinton and her husband are about to go on tour\nA charge people seven hundred and fifty bucks to hear those two\nOn stage talk about whatever\nAnd the two are starts right after the midterms\nI I don't know I write is I apparently it's an international tour I don't know I wouldn't pay back kind of money I Can't think of a politician I Would pay that kind of money to see unless you could bring one back from the dead like Abraham Lincoln that I'd say okay that's worth it Hillary\nBill and frankly this is going to be the most time they used to have ever spent together since they left the White House\nIt probably is\nThat they stay in separate rooms when they're on tour anyway let's give let's give Hillary or a little bit of a listen I'm ... and ... and it'll it'll explain why are we can probably expect of violence from Hillary\nWell not necessarily Hillary but the Democrats a party that wants to destroy whoa wait a minute by minute listen again sorry\nSeveral rip out\nBy the river will come on\n[laughter] I hate this computer Danny\nYou hate it she says there's no reason to be civil with a political party um that that wants to hold on a second\nPolitical party wants to destroy what you found for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse Armed or the Senate that's been civility can start a dance okay I Know he'll do did you hear that that's a threat\nWe're not going to be civil until we win back\nThe house of the Senate\nThat's violence\nThat's inciting but look we've seen it across the country\nWe've seen it in the halls of our Capitol building we've seen it in the Senate buildings we've seen it in front of the Supreme Court mob rules\nYour saying to antifa and the rest of them\nLess we win it back no peace no justice no peace no justice no peace what is ...\nHow can this be tolerated how can what she's saying be tolerated\nAnd now consider are Republicans saying the same thing\nThe only thing that the Republican whom to recognize and respect its strength\nYou hear that that's what you say to a despot\nSaddam Hussein\nOr the mullahs in Iran\nWe've heard that rhetoric before and that's where that rhetoric is reserved for then you're going to tell me a secretary of state she doesn't know what she's saying they're\nI'm telling you folks I'm not making this up you listen to what this woman said can you tell me if that's not inciting violence\n\nWere ... who several whip a political party that wants to destroy what you found for what you care about\nSo I then if you are trying to destroy what I stand for and what I care about ... should I be should I be violent should I not be civil\nSo when if you take over\nThe Senate and the house should I not be civil because your going to try to destroy what I stand for and what's important to me now I won't because I don't have like a leftist folks read your history\nAnd and I'm getting I'm going to use the Nazi comparison here then I Know people say oh God that's now you just being ridiculous hold on a second hold on a second\nWhat Maslany do what'd Hitler do\nYou do you know the history of how they came to power\nYeah yeah I remember some at the red hair right\nYeah yeah but uh but Nikki Haley really has come to the forefront but the truth is that the UN ambassador ship you had several like Susan Rice and Samantha Power who's there for four years\nBut other than that it really is a high turnover position with a lot of people lasting just a couple of years or even a year and the job you look at John Bolton\nA John Bolton was only on that job for a short time yeah ah two thousand five to two hundred thousand sex so uh you know ... it is a high turnover position is it a surprise that she's getting out all the surprises that nobody knew about it\nI Love that I mean she went to the stories she went to Trump about six months ago and said hey I Want to get out by the end of the year I Need you know I Need a little rest and I'm so\nShe's it it was kept a secret and then it was dropped yesterday and that started the inevitable why\nYeah hello what's hey what what's the matter well we know she's not being checked out because she got a private audience into and uh yeah in a photo op at a press conference with the president and the oval office that that's that's the best send off I'd seen anyone receive\nYeah you don't get that you don't get to resign from the oval office said that it happened so while it was a surprise to apparently everybody I mean they even say Mike bomb pay on John Bolton didn't know about it was an orchestrated resignation\nUh and and one that uh where she goes out on on you know very good terms with a with the White House\nSays she's not running for office going to campaign for the president twenty twenty but private sector and he really thinks she's going to go back to the private sector\n[noise] I don't think so I ... it may be a case where she just wants to make some money because you know this it's not the government jobs are not for high paying job and she and her husband have a lot of death according to the financial disclosure so\nHe could probably make more money now jamming on speaking engaged and then he could in an entire year as you\nAn ambassador not a bad idea we bill we need to get a racket like that is I Know I mean we we we we can speak forever I mean it wouldn't be definitely wouldn't be any heavy lifting for us just to get somebody to pay though that would be great\nYeah would anybody pay but not me no\nNo bill the other way round Bill thanks so much will catch up with you soon the adept already bills him for everybody don't go anywhere we get the bottom of the hour news coming up and then after that yeah we will get to your phone calls how about a

peaceful but anyway let it get to this 'cause there is something I wanted to ask you and um it's something I talked about uh uh with um\nYour publicist and it was this that there is a reason why Brett Kavanaugh I'm married to no matter how you may feel about him got approved got got the votes to be on the Supreme Court and that Donald Trump whether you agree with him or not\nGot elected there is a connection in the way the two men be have and it's something you talk about and encourage people to do what is that\nI'm not here and ... you know what you're looking at other than um I don't I have not been drawing parallels between a\nMountain us but he's talking about being an ... no no no being authentic me being real\nWell I think that ... actually so I don't know that I I don't see it that way ever um I Do believe authenticity for sure uh you know when it when people step and for their own authentic power and are there to sell\nTheir Roman thrown from your mom and and really that's the most powerful anyone can ever be I don't I don't know that I'm\nEither of those individuals right now are being their authentic though but um you know I can say for me I absolutely am and and the moment in time that I I decided to be transparent and the second show my flaws and off which is really what my book is all about\nThat was really the most um the strongest I've ever come in my
