don't know where I don't know where I don't you know what I don't have enough to be a heat it up in New haven and you'd be forty it's got to be a ... ... if you'd be forty Thirty years ago could do a little bit bigger than toads place I think\nWhat you think you'd be probably but you'd be surprised the or the or the acts they get in there with the yeah I Know I Want to play into it now I Do know toads\nAre engineer or our previous engineer who still kind of work for us a little bit used to do work there [noise] yeah but okay so it's a it's over Thirty years ago there's some kind of a an altercation after the concerts somebody thought that one of the guys in the bar was the lead singer\nOf you'd be forty wasn't I mean really we've got we've got a pen sold police report [laughter] well actually what I meant that's black ink we've gotta blacking police report before they put them on laptops you know over Thirty years ago and this is passing for us\nTo solve feeds into the narrative he's a blackout drunk\nOkay\nUm meanwhile Kate Snow and anchored MSNBC last night interviewed Julie sweat neck you know the one who's represented by the creepy porn lawyer\nMichael I have an oddity\nSo she's the one who said\nThe the whole thing about gang rapes and these parties where they're released gang rapes\nThat nobody else knows about you know no one else knows about\nMe tell you I'm going to party and something like that happens I think I'm going to share it with somebody other than just law enforcement\nAll right so Kate Snow interviews this woman the interview was a disaster\nBecause of all of her inconsistencies yet MSNBC still airs it and here's a here's your explaining why they still aired it\nWhere overall out all that so fed her story our report and we want to be very transparent because they are very valuable Kavanaugh has called ... story live far far preferable question her credibility and\nEverything for for the record has over ... independently verify her class fair our phones that she told us on camera that differ from her rent or phone while we're trying to reach out there who are paddled hired\nSomebody came forward gilly sweat Mick you're interviewing her there's inconsistencies you still\nAir it you know why two reasons one you want eyeballs\nOkay you got to be get right Steve Danny if if I found out that Julie sweat naked contacted one of you and you guys said to me we could have her on the show what do you think my answer would be absolutely\nYes of course can you imagine all the people would tune in of course we\nCompletely destroy you are but you know\nThat one I wouldn't let that woman I wouldn't feel bad about I'd say gee I I I Am sorry that that uh you're\nAlleging that you were a victim of a of a of a rape but I'm the rest of your story stinks\n... first question would be well you went to ten parties and they were gang rapes\nBut it's like well you know I used to swim in the river and every time I went for ten times somebody got pulled under by a crocodile last time it was me you went back yeah Everytime\nSo NBC put this woman on why because they were going to get eyeballs\nBut we also know the other reason why they put her on the other reason they put her on is because it fits their narrative now\nIt gets worse how about this one\nLetter was sent to\nThe committee\nThe Senate Judiciary committee\nSigned Jane Doe ... says\nThis woman in the letter who identifies herself as Jane Doe\nClaimed that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh raped me several times\nHit her after\nRiding are offering a ride home from a party and then said no one will believe you\nKnow return address no information about the attacks nothing\nIt went to Camelot Harris\nShe added in her hands and didn't\nAsk him anything about is however the um the\nA letter got leak out\nSo well let me just ask this and I'm not suggesting anyone do it no you know what\nLet's let's let's take a break I'm gonna I'm gonna

where\n[noise]\nGoing to\nTalk good Tommy be in just so little but this this is very interesting you know we've discussed Keith Ellison\nThe\nUm deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee we have discussed him he's got a couple of allegations of domestic abuse against him and the Democratic\nParty in Minnesota where he is a a congressman now for hailing from that state but also running for attorney general they said we're going to investigate this [laughter] oh okay we're going to investigate this so they went out and decided to hire a lawyer from a farm\nTo investigate it for them okay anyway the lawyer basically came to the conclusion that\nI'm\nRepresentative Keith Ellison a the ... the accusations against him\nWell the accusers claim was unsubstantiated\nThey said that her refusal to produce a video she claimed proved Allison\nAbused her lead the Minnesota attorney Susan ... to quote concluded that the allegation is unsubstantiated okay now the accuser is out saying I don't want this video to become part of the\nPublic record and I don't want it out there I don't want people\nTalking ... you know seeing this I mean hey given away stuff the leaks who think for a minute this video wouldn't be leaked well wait a minute it would make a Democrat look bad so probably wouldn't be leaked but listen to the tax in her report\nThat read quote from\nAn allegation Standing Alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred particularly where the accusing party declines to produce supporting evidence that she herself asserts exists\nSee this woman doesn't want to produce the evidence but let me let me read this and see if we can apply this to professor Ford\nAnd allegations Standing Alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred particularly where the accusing party fails to produce supporting evidence\n\nProfessor Ford as him produced anything she hasn't produced a single thing\nTo back up her claim now\nThe Democrats and their friends in the media have done a wonderful job of looking into judge Kavanaugh's background and saying well look at all the the the look at all these obviously a blackout drunk I mean they found a police report from over Thirty years ago\nBut see in this case\nWhy isn't that same principle applied to Brett Kavanaugh we all know why it's not applied to Brett Kavanaugh exactly

L. in icy me a public service sausage from the national insurance crime bureau\nFish is use radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG men double duty AG HD Worcester and I are ... radio stations\nIs All right with me this protest is All right with me people stood up while he was speaking this was an outdoor venue and held up signs like I Believe Dr Ford I Believe Christine Ford\nAnd just stood there silently and held the signs while he was being interviewed as part of this thing now that it's okay you want to do that fine as long as you're not in front of me and I'm trying to see then you stand up\nThat's fine maybe maybe the left will get it and just be quiet but you see they don't do it and they're not quiet what they do is typically you to to Jeff Flake\nIs they they follow him into an elevator and start yelling at him and saying I'm a victim of sexual assault and you hate me because you don't believe Dr Ford remember that\nRemember those two women do you know what we've learned about those two women\nWho chased him into the elevator first of all let's just tell you what they said I won't play that clip and and I don't know how this was coordinated I I didn't know this but remember Jeff Flake last week\nHe said he was going to vote yes he said he was going to vote yes on the committee after Christine Ford and after Brett Kavanaugh spoke and then he was getting into an elevator or trying to get out of an elevator and these two women\nApproaching them and started shouting out and why you realize this CNN had it live\nHow did that happen right a little coordination maybe\nBut the two women one of them said I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me I didn't tell anyone in your telling all women that they don't matter\nThat's what you're telling all of these women that's what you're telling me right now look at me when I'm Talking to you you are telling me that my assault doesn't matter don't look away from me look at me and then it was after that he went into that ante room\nCame out and said okay we should have an FBI investigation\nAt least for a week now yep CNN carrying it lie which I didn't know they had to live I only saw the tape after\nHow they coordinated that and the back all of a Senate building near the hearing room got at him he said later that didn't change my mind\nYou know I just thought it was a good idea to have an investigation will before that you said you were ready to vote on the committee and then on the floor\nWell here's the interesting thing\nFirst of all we played you the audio yesterday of the president's chief counsel Kellyanne Conway and Kellyanne Conway said while being interviewed on Jake Tapper Sunday show on CNN\nThat she was a victim of sexual assault and yet she didn't hold anyone else like Brett Kavanaugh responsible for it to a lot of attention a lot of anger is being directed Brett Kavanaugh\nBy some survivors of sexual assault that's because the ... the Democrats are getting them all fired up about this it's ... it's not it's not their fault it's not Jeff Flake fault that he heard\nCabin on earth for it and said I'm going to vote with a camera\nWell wait it gets deeper here lease to women\nAnd Maria\nAnd Maria Gallagher\nPark Sheila is an executive director of the center for popular democracy she and spent the previous week in Washington engaged in protest against Kavanaugh Gallagher is uh twenty three year old activist with the same group\nThe center is a left wing group heavily funded by George Soros is open society foundations\nGroup is one of the three largest donors to the organization\nSo when Brett Kavanaugh was criticized\nFor saying something\nAbout George Soros and the Clintons and everyone else when he was criticized for that they said he's getting political or wait a minute these two women\nWho got Jeff Flake and just happened to have a CNN camera they're alive\nAnd I don't know if you know anything about ... broadcast now those cameras run off why now in the old days used to have to have a live truck out front and that's why you see sometimes the digital picks elation when in when they're doing these things because you know alive now from just about anywhere\nGetting better and better you don't always made the big truck with the microwave unit on top or the satellite dish on top so they're roaming the halls with these cameras\nBut how did they get right to that elevator ride at that moment come on I wasn't born I mean I was born at night not last night\nWhich brings me to how are people feeling about professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh well Quinnipiac our friends down in Connecticut did a survey nearly half\nOf Americans surveyed forty nine percent\nBelieved that Brett Kavanaugh was the target of a politically motivated smear campaign now just as a reminder\nQuinnipiac got the twenty sixteen presidential election wrong\nForty eight percent of Americans according to Quinnipiac belief Ford\nWell forty one percent of Americans believe Kavanaugh forty eight percent of Americans believe cabinet or should not be confirmed while forty one percent believe he should be confirmed to the Supreme Court [noise]\nVery interesting very very interesting speaking of Connecticut the president has come up with a new nickname for someone he has and what was the last time Steve that\nDonald Trump came up with a nickname isn't isn't these got like Pocahontas he hasn't come up with a nickname\nAnd a long time Danny do you remember anything and nothing wrong man was the last one I read was she was ... in the last one\nI think it was yeah okay so I think so yeah I think rocket man was\nIt's been like that was a year ago he came up with rocket man 'cause remember he was just at the un now\nYou know for their for their the start of this session and last year you know the general assembly last year it was at the general assembly he said rocket man okay so it's been a year he's now calling Senator Richard Blumenthal\nFrom Connecticut denying Blumenthal now for those of you know that's a reference to a a um a location and Vietnam and yes Richard Blumenthal told everyone but he was in Vietnam and yet\nWe're supposed to believe everything else he says right didn't he say that Brett Kavanaugh give tell him about the legal principle of you know false and one thing false and everything that is if you're on a jury that's an instruction if you find a witness\nTo be lying in wait in one thing then you don't have to take anything the witness says this truth well\nI never told anybody I was in Vietnam but he did buddy skates on it right and then he's got the bees got the onions\nTo bring that up to Brett Kavanaugh like we're going to get you in one lie then we're not going to believe anything about you know ... Blumenthal is pretty good\nPretty good I Would have called him I Would have called him stolen glory when we return our national correspondent bills emperor you're listening to the gym police do show your safe space\nThe Jim ... show at best you weren't competent at worst you were complicit and either way you should be fire this report from the double duty AG price chopper market\nThirty to traffic center in an earlier crash there at sixteen and the turnpike in Newton eastbound it's contributed to heavy volume on the pike east basically from four Ninety five right either route one twenty eight and passed\nOne twenty sixteen tough tough right in the paper this morning in Worcester traffic's throws up before the hope I have an on ramp onto Ninety east bound and you're busy straight through the graph straight and the disabled vehicle is blocking the left lane on route one forty six north bound at ... street with your price job market thirty to traffic I'm Mike Ehlers\nIf you see something out there called the double duty AG traffic hotline one eight six six nine nine nine Seventy two hundred from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nGood morning everyone meteorologists Tom of our cloudy with a K. you know showers today much of the day will be rain free however I Will be in the ... or like a good chance of showers and storms low temperature dropping in the rain and for tomorrow guy become partly sunny\nOr visit the disparate group dot com\n[noise] now the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom more\nHuman cases of West Nile virus reported in the area of the state health department reports for new human cases including a woman in her forties\nFrom oyster counted that's been hospitalized six human cases last year twenty nine this year was through school superintendent Maureen but enda telling reporters last night that the Chandler elementary school has done nothing wrong they stayed in validating M. cast results from last year but\nSurprisingly have provided no details as to what was done to prompt the action superintendent seeking direct dancers now from the state some good news for rail riders in Worcester up for a million dollar for year upgrade for Union Station\nThe central platform will allow a lot more convenience for for riders\nChamber of commerce head Tim Murray with our media partner was for news tonight says the project includes tracking\nSignal improvements that will allow for to train standard the station at the same time for breaking news the news radio five eighty or Ninety four point nine ...
