of the day before I forgot to look into Kavanaugh's background and Mrs about believability why are we looking into\nDr Ford's background now there's a report out there and I don't know if it's the truth because so much stuff has come out and that is that it's not the truth although it's all been directed the cabinet report came out\nThat she helped\nA friend prepare for a polygraph test who was\nGoing for a security clearance usually when you're going for a security clearance you you got to take a polygraph test either you know\nSo\nDuring her testimony Dr Ford said I I've never helped anyone prep for Mali graft test never so as Richard Blumenthal says false in one false and everything\nRemember Blumenthal said that by the way he's taken a lot of heat the senator from\nConnecticut because he brought that up of all people to bring it up the guy Who Lied about service in Vietnam\nIs bringing up denying Blumenthal is the president calls him is bringing up\nThe ... that premise\nSo when you're on a jury\nIf you catch a witness in one lie\nBut and you can completely disregard all their testimony\nDoes how do you know if there weren't other allies then you just weren't you just didn't have enough information to determine that something else was ally to\nIt's an interesting yeah it's an interesting legal principle\nSo if that's the case then what about Dr Ford professor Ford Christine Blasey Ford if she lied if she actually did help someone now this could end up being a he said she said it's an ex boyfriend\nMade me he's got an axe to grind I don't know but it's like everything else in this case it's still boiling down to she said something\nThere is no cooperation and that's it so what do you do you go with um you go with Canada but the goal posts keeps moving you know what\nThis is supposed to be about whether or not a person\nCan handle the job of being a Supreme Court justice now\nBrett Kavanaugh has had the closest thing\nTo being a Supreme Court justice serving on the D.C court of appeals\nThat is one step away from the Supreme Court one step\nThat's like say okay you're the assistant coach could that person be coach\nMost likely\nIt's a it's a it's a good point\nThere's three hundred rulings he's done over the past what twelve Thirteen Years suddenly that's not an issue you know why it's not an issue there is nothing there it shows that he is qualified to do the job so then we had to move into phase two of the Democrats\nFighting Kavanaugh [noise] the reason the Democrats Democrats don't want cabin on the court is that he's like he's an originalist he's a constitutional if he is like\nAnd they don't want that on the court and they can't argue that\nBecause that have to come out and say we don't want him on the court\nBecause he we we like to um inject things into the constitution\nAnd he doesn't\nKnow we don't want somebody like that we like a Ruth Bader Ginsburg who sees things in the constitution that aren't there\nShe may be brilliant and all\nAnd I guess she's come to his defense to to Kevin ... she said I I I don't like the way this whole thing has been conducted\nBut the president came out and said oh he's going to get heat forward today here already is getting heat for it but if I were him I wouldn't have said that I Would have let my everyone else say it but you know what he's got the biggest megaphone\nThis is all about the mid term elections but oh I Can't hear you\nKnow maybe I get to crank all the way you know maybe no no that's\nBetter okay well if it's his Supreme Court nominee should he have something to say to somebody putting I was somebody that he's kind of sticking up for now I Know and uh but\nUm I Would try to stay above the fray but you know Trump doesn't care and I think he has now for a while but there's no kind of continued to continue to continue to a point to where he's like okay this is the guy put forth which just vote on this and move forward\nHe could say that but what he did was he he attacked her integrity which you know what to any ... you can\nYou know everybody is so sensitive about well she's a victim she's come forward okay but but her her accusation asked to hold

you step forward with an accusation like bad against a person that person has a right to defend themselves\nBut you know we're getting into the weeds here\nWe're really getting into the weeds the bottom line is this started\nWith a man who would spell twelve years on the number to court in the land the D.C court of appeals is the number to court in the land it's\nYou know the paw socks are coming in Worcester and then you have the red Sox\nIt's even it's even closer to the red Sox than the boss sucks you know what I mean it's you're ready to go you can be on the Supreme Court because your one small step away from it there are people on the pa Sachs who will never see the red Sox\nBut\nThe ... the position that judge Kavanaugh's in right now he's ready to go and they couldn't do anything about any of his rulings they couldn't pick apart his competency uh McCord he's been there for twelve years not\nOne single thing about in this ruling you said a B C\nThat's contrary to precedent that's contrary to nothing now are arguing over booth and Democrats are saying we'll have him on perjury\nThe New York times put out that\nPoof\nMeant drug use in the eighties\nNo no no I meant to sex act at another time it meant drug use\nI'm not kidding the New York times there researchers there they're looking into\nBecause they want to get 'em on perjury\n'cause he ... he was under oath when he testified and they asked him about when Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island the senator asked him boost that was in your book what does that mean flatulence senator\nYou mean farts yeah that's what it means and yet the New York times did a story that said he could have perjured himself imagine that Danny seriously I Want to go to New York times offices and say pull my finger\nProbably get a front page paper and about you put my finger guys I'm\nSo that's what it's become now we got to get them in a perjury trap which is what the Russia investigation spent about well we don't have any that on Russia but we're going to get you on what you said about Russia\nOkay well we don't have anything on anything else\nThat we can't support this claim\nUm we don't have any other evidence from from professor Ford who by the way now and and you can take this with a grain of salt\nAnd ex boyfriend is step forward I guess the guy you dated her for about six years\nAnd he said he remembers her\nCoaching someone who had to take a polygraph test the person was either going to work for the FBI or they were getting a security clearance and they had to take a polygraph test and I believe by then she had her PHD and she was going to coach them on how to take the polygraph test\nNow you may remember during your testimony she said no I mean I I don't know anything about polygraphs and I've never helped anyone with a polygraph touchy answer that question directly\nDoesn't know anything about polygraph tests oh and guinea remember when I said um\nThat someone would come forward and say a Democrat wouldn't come forward and say\nThat they that he has to take a polygraph test and it's happened I'm not surprised it's happened twice I saw the video of it yesterday and I'm a congressman as step forward and actually a very prominent congressmen\nA very very a prominent congressman has come forward and said\nOh he's got to take a ah he's got to take a um a polygraph test\nWhy why why oh she took one oh okay so anyway going back to her\nUm his uh to to um to the comments that have been made by others about him now there are comments being made about her\nAnd this is an ex boyfriend I have no idea whether or not that guys telling the truth he also said she never talked about being assaulted what does that mean I don't know\nTo me that's about as relevant as booth\nIn his ear book\nAnd so far we've got\nStill her not really under a lot of scrutiny\nJudge Kavanaugh\nThey continue Cory Booker saying I'm a ... this is time for him to go I mean he really should should he he ... to this is a a a moral crossroads for America yeah okay Corey\nHere's here's why Democrats are there like a cornered wild animal right now\nThey thought that by now Kavanaugh would have withdrawn his name they thought by now the administration would have withdrawn his name they\nThought by now that the Republicans would have folded like a cheap suit like they

I'll be curious to see how Mary I handle this because you had that Amazon announced yesterday that workers I have been waiting for this moment\nYou know worse or how you and I've been talking about wages for three years yes\nFinally workers are recognizing that they have leverage on these companies Dario if you're the company believe me you want a depressed wages as much as you possibly can yep\nAnd I worked for a lot of depressing wages well you know think about if you're if you're the c._e._o. and the CFO that company yeah\nYou don't make a bonus because you gave jumpsuit or race is old and a bonus we're still having made a big company and then the way these guys are paid right yeah that's true\nIf it they're paid based on managing expenses they'll call it but they you know when when you look at a business like very odd I'm guessing thirty thirty five percent of their overhead is wage labor expense yeah so the more you can depressed that the bigger bigger your CEO bonuses got to be workers\nFinally figuring this out and there I\nI think they're going to get paid I I think Mary up there and how you know they're very profitable company um if you're the CFO you're calling the the guy doing the negotiation and saying okay well you know give them another dollar an hour and see if\nThat and see if that works yeah yeah I Know um retail stocks um is retail\nReborn or or is there is a struggling\nYou know why Jim is like if you look at the retailers right now the you're the manager for a Walmart okay or a BJ's right bee Jay's is a local company will bee Jay's pays nine dollars an hour\nSo you've got a kid coming into work or you got a full time worker bee Jay's is making ten bucks an hour he's going to be knocking on your door is the manager and say hey I just heard Amazon will pay Fifteen bucks an hour right\nWhat are you gonna do right and so what we saw yesterday is retail stocks go down in value all because people are saying hey if Amazon's paying Fifteen target is going to pay Fifteen Walmart home the Home Depot only pays ten bucks an hour you know so that and I'm going from\nTheir minimum hourly wages but Macy's pays minimum hourly wage of nine dollars an hour Dollar General pays eight dollars an hour or so\nThese companies Jim ... they're competing for workers it's a great story it [laughter] when when companies have to compete for workers wages go up they go up the low end right the guy that it was nine years now making Fifteen\nIs making Fifteen he's going to spend it now he is right right ... ... it's all part of the show I said the

talking about whether or not this person is qualified to serve on the court\nI'm sure Cory Booker if given the three hundred decisions that judge Kavanaugh rendered would have trouble understanding\nThem or help me with this word here\nNo seriously okay\n[noise] um if you noticed\nOver last weekend\nThe follow social media Twitter\nThe debate over Brett Kavanaugh moved from ah whether or not\nHe was involved with\nThirty five thirty six years ago it move from that to the discussion and debate over slang college drinking inside jokes or whether he was just too angry to be a

asserts that Kavanaugh was present on that occasion\nAbout miss was completely absurd\nFirst of all you want me to believe that a woman would repeatedly go to parties where there were gang rapes\nAnd which would presumably generate many witnesses victims bystanders and people didn't say a word for decades about this\n... ...\nLeft wing Twitter\nTweets over the weekend you know what people were
