synagogue\nIs a is not the solution to violence wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute we ask somebody walk into a synagogue and start shooting you're going to tell me having a police presence there isn't that started by the way I I'm very surprised\nThat this synagogue didn't have people their guards there um Dershowitz went on to say when he goes to synagogue yes to go through a metal detector they have armed guards and he goes through a metal detector you ever you ever go walk by a synagogue on Saturday in New York City\nYou up you have your basically a a couple of um the the\nArmed guards would swap uniforms on because you have to to protect to protect everybody in the temple and I'm actually surprised this temple was visited by homeland security is part of their training\nOf a soft targets on ways to protect themselves an active shooter situations to synagogue in Pittsburgh unprotected no this isn't this isn't victims shaming at all\nThis is I'm just surprised most others synagogues\nBut Trump was told you shouldn't say that well wait a minute have you ever been newer synagogue\nDominic sorrow in Springfield and the and the police commissioner put out a message this weekend hey we're going to increase our patrols around synagogues\nAny near anything from your petty but I I I you know um\nThat's exactly what you need to do let's go to Robert

president if we can say this for an hour on every time\nSomebody says something bad about half of the Democrats come up with some wacky idea here they start falling out of this person just go okay come people it doesn't mean much and let it go die because he adding power to it\nBut you don't have to always say that but if you just start doing that a regular basis instead of giving them the energy to keep that lie going you know what I'm saying\nHere and I know but then you have guys like Adam Schiff out there I'm saying you know saying stuff like this honestly\nI think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us uh he gets up in the morning when new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year you're saying thanks to bring us a into conflict with each other you\nKnow and you're not saying anything to bring us into conflict with each other Democrats aren't saying anything Democrats aren't showing up in the nation's capital and go rating people interrupting the work of our government shouting at committees shouting at members of Congress\nI hadn't either yeah\nYeah but these are things that number one people can anonymously get their view is out there number two they can find like minded individuals and then they can then collaborate with and encourage each other and that's an inflammatory situation the third part of it is\nThe foreign influence I mean we all know what Russia has done with our social media and the issues that they pick on\nWith these with these trolling post whether it is a racial divide in the country religious divide in the country and they hate or whether it be against gays or against uh against you know are these all factor into this situation\nBut to say this is a battle of good and evil and that's what we've gotten this country a ... and and evil starts at the top is just not not the right way to go about it\nYeah Adam Schiff another Democrat honestly I think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us yeah that's it and he goes on a he gets up in the morning with a new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough\nHe gets up every morning with doing away how was that bringing us together\n... it's not ... and that's the ultimate question how do we do that the uh it it will end up first

I'm a value investor\nAnd he's right you don't buy based on hey everybody's buying Amazon\nI was trained I I I Do a lot in that investing in our firms investing based on you know am I paying a good price for that company yeah relative to what I\nTo the common and then it gets a little rowdy and the police say okay everybody go home and go to bed and that's what a lot of us did and I were waking up this morning world champions Kevin is uh doing some work for ... Kevin you have an interesting\nStatistic we are spoiled here in Boston and in New England we can compared to when I was a kid\nWhere you know it was the Bruins and it was then the Celtics keeping us happy goes through since two thousand how many championships have been brought home here\nAre up or I don't think you make of it\nBut he in two thousand and one we had the New England patriots yep oh three and four we had the pets you up in over four and seven we had the Sox yup\nAnd ... we had the Celtics about two thousand eleven was the Bruins yep two thousand Thirteen was a Red Sox yup fourteen and sixteen was the pets you know now Eighteen is a Red Sox with a very bright future for both the Boston Celtics the Boston Bruins and even the New England patriots I see\nJust insane it's just insane it's great but as Danny said earlier today we've had a what did you say the red Sox have one more World Series championships than any other team this century [laughter]\nBut I went to the patriots a parade the last Super Bowl they won and there was an eleven year old kid who had a sign does I'm eleven years old and I've seen all my teams win\nWow ship or not what I was eleven years old guys go their whole lives and never get to see one of their own one no my poor uncle chick ah he he passed away before two thousand for his blood red Sox anyway so we celebrate that today but it's been a weekend of triumph\nAnd tragedy triumphs and tragedies that are suddenly the shooting in Pittsburgh has become Donald Trump's fault and ah here's a remember Howard Dean\nRunning for president Howard Dean former governor of Vermont\nHere's what he had to say over the weekend um he's doing a good job of bringing us all together good job go Howard\nI don't think it gets better I think it gets worse uh because at the end of the day the president said\nThe town I I'm Sorry that was shot he sets the tone\nSorry that's Chuck Todd Chuck Todd on Chuck Todd on meet the press basically told people um go out and go out and vote and get rid of Trump\nI mean there's so many words he said it hold on let\nEvil lurks in the hearts of men that\n[laughter] and it does and what Trump has tapped into is evil and eventually will overcome that because of the Republicans are always about the past and they're always have that fear of the future\nAnd the Democrats and they'd plenty of mistakes that they are about the future and idealism and making America a better place I think in the end hope wins over evil but it takes a long time and it works it but\nIt is it is is a star wars trilogy hope when the dog side hope when's over evil\nWhen it gets better both of those working humankind and that's what this struggle of out from that this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nDid you hear that I'll just do one more time to make sure you got to have that\nGood versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nThat'll bring us together right because half of the people in this country voted for him and support him so that'll bring us together right\nTrump is tearing us apart or Adam Schiff democratic congressman said this over the weekend\nHonestly I think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us he gets up in the morning when they went inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day is a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the air and saying things to bring us a into conflict with each other\nThey'll wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute so Donald Trump the man the president\nWho finally make good on the promise to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nThe man who daughter married a Jew then converted to Judaism and now he's got a Jewish grand kids I mean the guy who did business in New York City which has a larger Jewish population than Israel\nThat guy he he's anti Semitic\nHe's the one he's the one to blame well what's interesting is Alan Dershowitz\nWhen asked about um anti Semitism in politics had this to say yesterday morning\nPresident Obama meets with Sarah current\nShame on him President Clinton sits on the same platform with for a shame on him Keith Ellison joins with Sarah ... ... is one of the greatest purveyor as of anti Semitic hate just because he's black doesn't give them the pass on anti Semitism\nAnd any liberal who has any positive association with her on his part of the problem\nYeah you you know what the problem is Alan and he went on to talk about it it's on our college getting the real anti Semitism\nIn America is is not in the Klan it's not what the white nationalist it's on college campuses to divest movement a boycott movement\nFrom from Israel or he told a story about a student he knew who was going to do a semester abroad in Israel and needed a recommendation from a professor and a professor said no I'm part of the boycott movement I Can't write that recommendation for you to go to Israel are you kidding me\nYou don't think that you don't think that's anti Semitism\nThat that's not anti Semitism\nSiding with the Palestinians as an anthem know gym it's politics is diplomacy no it's not to the Palestinians want the destruction of Israel, Why do they want the destruction of Israel because they want the destruction of the Jews how many times do I have to say this\nHow many times and now it's oh where do you hear this one this is a good one [noise] headlines out their\nJewish leaders in Pittsburgh said Trump is not welcome to visit the synagogue were eleven people were shot I said\nMy God really I mean they don't want to visit from the president\nWell you got to read deep into the story\nAnd you find out that it's the Pittsburgh chapter of a progressive and radical left wing Jewish group called the bend the arc bend the arc arc as an arc of the covenant\nIs a very left or I mean they're left of burned me\nLeft Jewish group well they're Pittsburgh chapter and I I guess there's twelve people in their Pittsburgh chapter wrote a letter to the president saying we don't want you to hear all well wait a minute you've got to denounce white nationalism\nSo wait a minute are these actually the people who represent the Jewish community in Pittsburgh or is this just a radical group in their local chapter and why would you say you don't want the president there\nThen you get the mayor of Pittsburgh saying\nGuns are not the solution to solving this problem wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute hold on hold on\nIf I'm going into a synagogue this weekend and I've been in many synagogues I I'm I'm going to look around for security what's the security here and and if you don't have security why don't you\nYou know your target did you know the homeland security was in this Pittsburgh\nSynagogue within the past year training them an active shooter situations\nThat's how bad it is in this country that homeland security has to go to synagogues and teach them about active she I mean I Know we have to do it in our schools but here's the thing\nIf you know people are coming in with guns and frankly I was surprised and this isn't victims shaming I was actually surprised that this Pittsburgh synagogue didn't have\nSecurity go to New York city on a Saturday morning and walk by synagogues and see what you see what the security is

this country\nThat has kept the Celtics he had spoken out publicly against the racism that Russia was facing in Boston and around the league and he he wishes to that he had pulled them aside privately just rough cut your back\nThe Obama presidency is that if there was one man who could have brought us together it would've been him right because I had the tension of white people he had the votes of non minorities\nAnd if there was anyone who could have brought us closer together you would have been him and he failed miserably\nHow 'bout that journalists over you can always be headed by ISIS even
