sixty seven the impossible dream team but they did the impossible and Danny was you know during the five o'clock hour when we were just on in central mess explaining\nIt and he said hey this exceeded expectations and uh and that's it seem\nYou were one of the ones saying that it and they're not going to make it to the world series uh pretty much yeah\nI had no problem rooting against this team I'm a I was just I'm Amazed at how well they're pitching was I mean I remember saying a couple of days ago they got us our five five or more runs against everybody if they're going to win and a lotta times they had to do that but uh no it's really like all coming\nTogether I I hate when they said the teams of destiny but I mean when they need a big hit they get a big hit when they have big catch in the outfield they get a big catch in the outfield and the need to strike out they get a big strike out and uh\nWhen the fan interference they get fan and\nGet a fair and interference yeah I don't know it's funny even though they said going into today's game oh I'm Sorry into last night's game they sort of\nThe red Sox had this approach of like well if we when we when we lose we lose right because we're up three to one in the series were still playing down in Houston if we lose this game whatever we go back to Fenway Park we got two more ... yeah up three to two in this series and so last night was I don't want to call it a throwaway game it never is in the playoffs but they they would have accepted a loss and yet they went out there\nAnd got great pitching from a a guy who is just stunk his entire career in the playoffs\nFinally came out of a shell and pitch great they got the wind\nAnd ah I think expectations changed now because they are much better than either of the teams in the national league and uh they should should be World Series or bus right now for the red Sox down there we go\nNow what do we find it would it be fun Jim is if the Dodgers win and then you get all these guys from LA coming out here where it's going to be you know about forty nine degrees in\nRaw and you know we didn't have any you know what Danny and I didn't even think of that because I was asking him earlier who do you want Milwaukee you know or do you want to LA and uh we never even took that into consideration the fact that they would have to go to a ball park\nWhere you can't have sushi in the stands right they would ... they would they would have to sit here and in a in a rickety old park which has a lot of tradition and ...\nAs a very uncomfortable seats and not and have to eat 'em well meat byproducts out well but the natural casing Frank [laughter] meet by products no sushi you know crab and ... and ... has no nothing like that nothing\nNothing like that at all that

forty five they turn on the TV for the last four pictures of the game isn't ice that rolled over went back to ... they said hey which\nI I got a four and a half hour baseball games are just a boy and this has got to be a grind especially if I'm you know if the weather's going to be as it is here in Boston and you get the ah LA Dodgers coming to town for a half hour game at forty one degrees and and raw good\nLuck it's not ... it's not just the LA Dodgers right Jamie it's the Elway fans coming out here and saying\nWho is a sushi stand how come you can't get sushi Fenway\nYes I think the I mean they've had been played this last series in Milwaukee has been exactly warm in Milwaukee this week\nOr so we've at least had the been able to do that so far yeah the fans however that come up to the world series I've just seen the thing standing room only tickets going for a hundred and eighty dollars apiece it at Fenway Park than to go stand there and forty degree weather free eighty dollars and freeze then freeze\nYeah but to be there for a game I'm a ... it's exciting and I mean it's great the perspective here is the patriots are off to a great season now and we've got the red Sox so a real fair weather fans I mean I think are just kind of half just suck it up\nAnd watch for and a half hours of baseball just have to and it's going to be you know what it's painful for us because we've got to watch it now and we got to get up and do the show it's in the afternoon guys have it easy\nYeah a lot of the world series games they'll start to later either the west coast games that you might not start to really\n[noise] I mean the the the ... what nine o'clock if it's in LA ... company nine eight seven six yeah yeah\nStarted at nine o'clock will be getting up and watch the final

on prepping that's gonna hurt that although I Will say to people like John than everybody else who just hates Boston sports I just I Want to just say\n[noise] [laughter] I Know Danny what was that forty ONE Championship appearances and Eighteen ... magic that from Boston teams [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell you were in Germany bees or be Yankees fan and he doesn't care he's happy about it but some people just not new a New York post first thing I turn to when I found out that the red Sox had one and the New York post what's the hold on a second let me just read let me just read the headline\nBecause we've got so much other news to do it Yankees fans only can watch as the greatest rival dominates again\n[laughter]\nI Love it I Love it All right let's get to let's get to recreational pot here\nA few issues on recreational pot in the commonwealth now we're being told that the recreational pot stores are going to be open by Halloween is that is that trick or treat Danny how can they get this fall in line by the end\nOf the month is supposedly they found to testing facilities yesterday a now and they would have to be an open said facilities testy marijuana and they sold in ... eleven days I don't yeah\nSteve a when you saw fish did you notice that there's a shortage of um marijuana out there\nYeah it seems to me like the uh the the black market in the underground or area has just been totally dried up\nAnd it's just a impossible for anybody to find themselves any sort of marijuana ever ... whatsoever your band was the interpretation I got yeah you're being sarcastic yes I Am it everywhere and the longer that they wait the more the prices keep dropping in the black market and the less money to say the towns that are ah the ...\nIt's actually going to get because because the recreational marijuana is that I still think is going to be cheaper\nMuch cheaper than the stuff you're going to buy legitimately think about it this way think about the fact that there are certain things that we can't manufacture in this country\nCheaper than the Chinese\nAnd the reason is well in this country we have um we have a higher standard of living we have all these um environmental laws we have all these labor laws and everything else so\nThe fact that you have to ship something here from China means nothing because you can make it over there so cheaply well compare that\nTo pot in the commonwealth of Massachusetts is still going to be cheaper to buy illegal pot\nBecause it doesn't have to go to a testing facility it doesn't have to go to a retail establishment to be sold think about the costs associated with the recreational marijuana and to sell it versus getting pot from your regular\nDealer got you're also paying tax when you're buying an MD our head to the guy on the streets like riding an extra ten Fifteen bucks right there\nYeah exactly so and speaking of smoking this is what I Want to know down in North Hampton you know

of those places it's just crazy\nIs the ... the one in West side actually killed\nIn Westfield okay All right yeah\nI Know about keeping in mind keeping in mind I just uh I think everybody has their

safety and those are the folks who do the crash tests that are actually better than the government's crash tests\nThey were the first ones to do what's known as the offset crash test to the government would just drive a vehicle into a wall straight on\nAnd the majority of accidents are not like that like a straight on crime\nThey're usually and offset crash like\nYou hit something maybe had it on but it's with\nJust half of the front of your car\nAnd so what manufacturers we're doing is designing their car to\nSurvive the head on like race straight into the wall crash and meanwhile you got into an offset crash here in big trouble you could survive a straight ahead on crash the whole front of the car engaged but [noise] so anyway they're they're a good organization\nThey are have done a study\nAnd um they say that the\nStates where you legalize pot the number of car crashes have arisen now like every study you've got to look at all the different factors but they also cross referenced
