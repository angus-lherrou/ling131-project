their hair and I said the gap the he'll be two blue like there was a couple of they were like awkward and blue and all this it was pretty like Caribbean colors [laughter]\nI said how do you get that out she said that completely destroy your hair so why are ... what is going on with these new colors and and like I said a according to New York it's all the beautiful colors of the Caribbean\nAnd it's gorgeous I yeah blues very popular blue eye and do you know what the process that you have to do to get to that caller is right yeah you have to strip all the color out of your hair so you got so you make your one yes you take your hair down to white so then you have a vibrant blue\nYou gotta be kidding me but when you delete your hair out I mean you you run the risk of having a just snap because there's no pigment and it's very\nFragile bald she is bold Gerry's\nReally bother me at this point if you're going to hammer on I ... you you you too yeah three is Seinfeld there is oh I'm Sorry that China has this new color and now they're naming them like delicious things uh like rent now that is a very popular like red velvet cake well yeah ... and the cake itself\nRap because they use radish is to make your red or food coloring I think it but you really suppose house radish okay whatever I I Am a big fan but I ... a very very dry and then she was a beach is be typing\nBeach beach yeah yeah that would explain the color yeah so it's but it's brighter than beads\nAnd that that's going to be your hair so it's not something that would ... had naturally but think of like the Little Mermaid like area but he added around here and didn't she yeah but yeah but like I mean red ... cartoon read well because it was cartoon right so that that's the color that people are going for\nOkay so did they have to strip their hair down and white to do that\nI I think they get that bright bright red the right way I Do I you\nKnow I'm not a hundred percent sure but I Would say yes okay so that's why you touch this woman's hair and it's like straw\nAnd it's not good honey you broke my hair yeah it's like but I Know that Bob was owned by the way you broke my heritage shattered it's crazy and it was like what\nThey're doing um but people love it so you know he was a\nLittle more color is I've got to start looking for I should tell my mother in law red velvet like the cake red velvet ... usually put like white frosting on a regular chocolate yeah yeah yeah\nYeah now I'm I don't know just go under the hash tag ... that hair and you will see exactly what we're talking about okay\nWhat else is going on other than the people doing really stupid things to their bodies\nA let's say let's talk about how it by language says a lot about a year and a and they looked at\nThey want to have a very large body [laughter] so what is is is I think a lot about me me me saying I like to eat and I lead a sedentary\nLifestyle [laughter] this is the body language next segment I Know this is more if you share in bed with your partner and the way you position yourself while you sleep can really\nTell a lot about how you feel about the person when you're awake oh okay well let's let's to tell us about and then I'll see how I fit into this now you someone who is like a spoon her yeah I like to swim a kiss okay\nYeah I was in the early in the morning I say they got to just get in sync for the show we do\nRely so this is a couple that is very and sank and uh so much so that you couldn't even see them in the near future dressing alike they're just very um I don't think that's going to have this and other ...\nBut when you reduce okay what's the other one\nUm head on the chest they show the person feels very safe and secure in their partners arms that's very sweet\n... does that um\nIf you're a back to back sleeper yeah a sweeping like they showed each partner it's comfortable apart and also aware of each other space uh\nUh we sometimes see back to back because I'll be snoring because he would say and nobody wants to please turn over south face the other way and then she faces the opposite way so she doesn't hear it as much so we do that and then so we're comfortable with me sorry\nThat's all right that's nice too also farm draped across the other's back says\nI've got your back subliminally but I'll have to look for that one\n[laughter] and then on opposite sides you know you basically have to pay a toll to see the other person because you are a part yeah are you confident in a relationship and you don't require a shared space\nThat you have each other\nYou might have to have ... ... don't give me this you're comfortable in your space if right now people listening you look and you're like wow wow you know like you go like this to um your\nYour significant others on the other side of the bed and you have to go like this\nYou over there [laughter] hello I give it that far out by far far\nIt's not good well I mean I just got in on all of these I didn't say anything negative you did you see that\nAnd the only one more which I don't like this what does it face to face sleeping gross I'm going to be a better way these these couples often share food with each other personal business and they're there and they love talking\nThat Elizabeth Warren\nReleased this video\nOn line and Danny Steve it was almost like one of those reality shows with the reveal\nAnd she's on the speaker phone talking to\nThe scientists to did this analysis I was waiting for the commercial break Tacoma but I really was I was waiting for the you know how they you know when you're watching one of those shows and of course we do it here but before we go to a commercial we obviously want you to stay through the commercial\nAnd we tell you what's coming up to what your appetite only television I mean I work in television television is the worst\nThere you know they will build up to this crescendo\nOf who ooh\nYou got to come back and you write day and he was like you can see Elizabeth Warren's sitting there and saying so what did the research say was never the dun dun dun yeah and then you show show a couple of reaction shots of people in the music Rogers and then all of a sudden it's a commercial\nFor Geico I don't know any way she did this whole thing but what made it so cheesy\nAs it she put her three older brothers in it and I don't know if you guys saw this but\nIn all the scenes where she was visiting with people back in Oklahoma which I'm sure she hates to go back to Oklahoma I'm sure she hates it she's living in Cambridge now she's going to achieve shops she hates going back to Oklahoma anyway there she is in Oklahoma\nAnd they're all drinking beer even Elizabeth Warren is drinking a beer\nOnly it's in a bottle it's in a brown bottle and you can see the label now the brothers are drinking Coors in they can\nAnd it's almost like they're ... what we call fronting the product\nWhen you're in a a commercial or or there's product placement in some other movie or TV series\nYou know used to be you couldn't show the a brand name they put like gaffe first tape if somebody was eating a box of chips\nI meet a bag of chips simply gap first table over the name so now they are fronting the product you see someone sipping a drink and it's the actual product and companies pay for that\nIn movies they pay for it\nAnd the can is held just right think of the James Bond movies with Daniel Craig bond used to wear a Rolex they sub Mariner ... now he's wearing an old media\nWhich is a fine watch but on me go wanted the contract for the watches in the bond franchise so we were as an illegal\nAnd they even mention is and Casino Royale them and they mentioned it even the the the love interest looks at the watch and cheese and he says ... she's he says or me and she says beautiful\nAnd it's like a commercial\nSocialism or the orange brothers are sending their drinking Coors Beer out of the can and they can is friend did\nSee you see its course the other thing is you can tell Elizabeth Warren\nHas never had a bottle of beer in her hand a bar\nBottle of beer 'cause she's holding it was two hands\nCan you guys explained to me who holds a beer with two hands\nDeep Danny something we have got to have one\nYou have one in the top and then one does support the bottom out is so that's basically how she's holding it which is if you have it in the all around bear hug\nNo no no she had one hand on the bottom one hand on the top and it's almost like like I have never held disappear before it's not a wine glass filled with chard may so I don't know how to do this which\nI don't have a problem with per se is you know uh my wife has never held a beer bottle because she doesn't like beer right so I have a problem with her not liking beer but when she pretends to see I'm clearly tell but she doesn't she had on the issue\nRight exactly exactly Steve come on this was all set up and Democrats are mad at her for dropping this yesterday and by the way this explains her visit to Holyoke when she went to the\nTown hall in the city hall auditorium and said I'm going to take a hard look at it and now the wording in the globe was hard evidence\nThat she's a native person then didn't I tell you guys yesterday Danny I can say go to the tape but did not tell you guys yesterday that everybody else was going to pick up on the headline and that's\nAll you were guinea here all day yesterday was the head of terrible\nYeah everybody was using it nobody ever report that what it was hard evidence yeah some some some phrase something and and that's why that's why she\nGave it to the globe 'cause she knew the globe would write a sympathetic story and the story first of all had the big mistake in it right the glove didn't do their math how how do you do that an important story like that and you didn't do your math\nAnd and you had to correct it later\nAnd then the New York times now obviously the New York times which used to own the Boston Globe the New York times says\nHey we're gonna teach them a lesson you guys did your math wrong\nYou got it all wrong yeah but the narrative in the main idea what they want to portray with the headline is bucket out there so that got out of the lead anti drug take back the number of people are going to see that here's the thing\nIf you bought the print edition of the globe it's sad\nProves I'm native ancestry\nIn the online version the version we add the headline was\nUm releases releases results a DNA test\nSo the the headline in the newspaper was real and I mean and the print copy was really pushing it I mean that was a slanted story look this was all coordinated she already had the video down\nSo that's why in in Holyoke she said I'll drop the answer there\nAnd then she drops this story on the globe are friends there at the globe do the story for her\nAnd then she releases the campaign video on our website where she's down in Oklahoma drinking beer with her brothers and then she pulls out some cousin\nBy Aaron Hernandez and Aaron Hernandez probably kill those other two guys but you know he was acquitted I'm if I'm old and Lloyd family I'm disgusted\nWith the globe because they are trying to paint a sympathetic picture of him\nAnd they were even dragging Brady in like Meghan brainy look bad hey did you hear what was caught\nOn camera Brady and ah Rob Gronkowski did you hear about that Danny ... at the end of the game um he gives them a ... you know you get the field cameras this was after Sunday night's game and he said\nWe're gonna play together forever yeah [laughter] yeah well\nEven with the rumors this off season the basically the patriots were within hours of training rug Ron said no I'm not catching pacifism anybody else but Tom Brady I'll retire a retired now isn't it nice that he's in that position that he can say that when you're considered by many to be one of the top two or three titans of all time\nI guess you gotta do it you know but I I like\nThat because in so many businesses you know in that business in the entertainment business in our business and media all of that you know somebody else it within the one percent who can actually get away with all the players on the team that could get away with that him and Tom rated him and Tom Brady yeah good for Bronx okay\nWhen we return we'll talk more about Elizabeth Warren we talk about the big debate last night between Jim McGovern\nAnd Tracy love on who's going to be on the show tomorrow and old coming up later in the show of course Craig Peter ... but you want to come back if he can around ten past eight Michael ... he was an advisor to President Trump\nGreat guy he says the whole cabinet thing was a dress rehearsal by the Democrats for the impeachment of Trump if they regain the house and that brings me back to talking about McGovern who thinks they're going to regained the house and he's going to have a big powerful position\nWell I think there was a knockout punch scored against them last night\nAnd of course because the seven people were paying attention to that debate I don't know how much of a difference that will make all of that when we return and then Tommy beyond the forecast you're listening to the gym please do show you're safe space\nThe Jim ... show I like you because your special we appreciate what you've done the bravery that you display and the love that you have for your country [noise] [noise]\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nAnd was

[noise] [noise]\nAnd let's even go to she's one thirty second that would be the best case scenario poll by the way the global had to correct their story because based on the math\nIs actually the high and she's the one\nUh twelve hundred American indian then again a test is a foolproof\n\nSo\nKenny she decided to put herself in a law book\nAnna directory of lawyers and professors who consider themselves Native American\nShe wrote that put a recipes and that cookbook\nPowwow chow\nAnd let me ask you a question if you if you were one thirty second\nOf some race\nWould that be an identifier that you would put forth\nSo let's say you find out that your one thirty second Jewish\nBlind in one thirty second Jewish\nWould you put out\nOr put yourself into a directory\nI Am one thirty second Jewish\nI mean the rest of you could be Irish Scottish German French whatever\n\nOr let's say the rest of you was English\nAnd you came up one thirty second Jewish\nWould you suddenly put yourself in a directory identifying Jewish people doing your particular job\nOf course he wouldn't\nBut somebody did to take advantage of by\nAnd remember when I told you about this man\nHe's an insurance agent Ralph Taylor he had a DNA test that show these four percent African and so he wanted to be identified by the government as I'm as a minority business\nSee if you're a minority business you are giving preferential treatment and government contracts [noise]\nHe has since been told no you can't do that he's Ninety percent European six percent indigenous at I'm American and four percent sub Saharan African\nHe's more [noise] indigenous\nThan Elizabeth Warren\nRemember I told you about this guy and he's fight it he's fighting\nTo get minority status approval it's part of the disadvantaged uh businesses program but the government has\nAnd he wants government contracts\nElizabeth Warren check the box\nAnd filled out the um\nForm to be put him a listing of minority\nProfessors why would a press release go out saying Harvard\nLaw school has hired its first woman of\nColor [noise] why what color\nAnd by the way the New York times came out with this story after we went off the air yesterday saying that based upon the findings Elizabeth Warren is actually has less\nIndigenous blood in her\nThan the average of European person of European descent living in the United states\nThey have anywhere from twice as much to three times as much\n\nThe folks from the Cherokee Nation\nPut out a press release last night and I agree with them\nThey said\nThis has nothing to do with being a Cherokee\nThis has nothing to do that a DNA test does not make you a Cherokee and by the way\nIt's still very very difficult\nTo do a test like that [noise]\nAnd show ethnicity\nYou know we see the commercials that guy saying [noise] um we were told that we were German and ah I grew up but I was told I was German or or something like that and that I traded and my killed\nBy training in my later owes him for a killed because I found out I was Scottish\n\nCould be wrong that commercial and by the way I support ancestry\nAnd the work that they do but that could be wrong\nAnd here's why that man\nIf you look at the history of Germany [noise] do you know that\nYou know through the through the centuries the warring in Germany and in Europe said people migrated from one section to another and when they did they adopted the culture of that section even though the their DNA came from somewhere else\nSo he may go where Irish\nOr where German or whatever it is\n... very well may be German that\nHundreds of years ago his people went from Ireland to Germany and stayed in Germany\nThese tests just aren't accurate determining ethnicity they're\nActually more accurate of determining a lot of other things ethnicity is very difficult\nIt's not a pure scientific test and that's why what Elizabeth Warren did doesn't prove anything while it proves the one thing\nShe's running for president\nBecause right after the story was broken by the globe per friends\nA video was released on her website that was almost like a reality show with her getting the test results\nIt was like being on an episode of Maury\nElizabeth Warren you are an American Indian the results are in\nThis day and he said earlier today and we're talking about this ... what time does the commercial you know do they do they hold you overthrew the commercial anyway\nFinal final word or were you going to have another one of these things where everybody Russia's the border like happened before\nI don't think so again because they've got a ways to go here according to my inaccurate estimation it probably is about eight hundred miles that they have to go and there will be several road blocks along the way most notably from Mexican authorities\nAlright bills as usual right up right up to the minute and we'll talk with you tomorrow the same time you got a gym thank you thanks bye-bye\nWhen we return

what how does this impact\nWell he can sudden foxwoods here you know I've got to believe that the negative and then what happens when ever it open because that's gonna you know the Boston people that are driving out the Springfield they're probably going to be less inclined to do so yeah but in the short term I'll tell you what\nShot in the arm right think about all the people that are working at the casino every day oh yeah downtown Springfield has been revitalized yeah as a result of this\nYou know it's uh Springfield needed it it was a good decision to go there I I'll be curious to see the social ramifications five ten years down the line\nYeah I ... that's the big question mark you know it's interesting Barry when you talk about um the state gets their cut the city gets their cut that sound like the mob\nYeah well the ... and just just enough to let my beat them\nLike something you know just a little tribute you know less or just to keep everything went smoothly\nThat it's basically what it is Ari NFL ratings I'm curious I haven't looked him up in a while Danny and I talked about it at the beginning of the season what's going on\nWhile they they'll be games are better like do you look at the patriots game on Sunday night that was the game they had in years ratings [laughter]\nUm and overall this season ratings are up about three percent Tokyo [noise] you know the the the the problem is there's just so many other things to do and if it's a nice sunny day I don't know about you but I'm not on the couch watching football\nThe destruction of a good man and his family battle be on display if you're like that you're going to last\nA nice scene as the Democrats take it over\nWe're talking with Michael ... former Trump campaign adviser and uh certainly on the inside track in DC I'm let let me ask you this though ... don't you think there were a portion of people\nWho saw the behavior of the mob the Democrats saw that it was astro turf that a lot of this was paid for\nDon't you think that those people maybe were turned off I Know the person who doesn't pay attention to the news like usually a listener to this show would may be fooled that aren't there a good number of people who maybe were turned off by it\nAll the polls show that not only Republicans were turned off by it\nBut a good job of independence and even some Democrats are saying well this is way too far and we've gone way too far and and I think that the Democrats truly overplay their hand a lot of people who for example you know we call ourselves the deplorable the people who came out\nTo vote for President Trump or maybe even when they're first time voting for a long long time you know they may not have come out during the mid term elections because while President Trump isn't actually on the ballot and they really only have voted for the part of the outsider candidate Donald Trump\nThey might have stayed home but actually they're starting to uh respond upholstery thing they understand that the cabinet thing as an example of how Washington or more run after the midterm if the Democrats take over and they realize it will blow\nOr completely stop the president's agenda\nAnd probably in many ways we're birth the economy the strong right now we're into the jobless rate or the lowest they've ever been in and in recent times\nAnd they understand that if they don't get out and vote even though the president himself as a physically on the ballot the president's agenda will be will be will be off completely\nSo a lot of those people who thought if you have your art I understood that it was astro turf and then it will be have or that was beyond the pale they're getting out the vote but if any of your weapon or are considering staying home on election day a that's a huge mistake\nYeah we we we make that message to everyone all of the time I'm Mike if they if the Democrats regain\nCongress even if it's by one vote are you willing to say even if it's by one vote and they will definitely try to bring up articles of impeachment\nI'll tell you ... you know anything that happens on a on the floor of the house represented than the United states than it is always accompanied with some kind of head count the thumb\nLeaders of the Democratic party now trying to judge the more radical members and the more radical candidates in trying to stop them from talking about impeachment but in reality my understanding is a photographer still going on in the back rooms in the caucuses are the Democratic party the fact that the party is still radicalized\nNow by who Trump pay you know they really don't have\nAn agenda during higher agenda on the campaign trail is stopping Trump hating Trump hating on Trump to point even thought but there are so consumed by this\nBut they will at least try to do it and if they fail it in ... when they certainly will do whatever they can stop the president ever return so if you if they fail to beat them they're certainly
