war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from near the man's school reform matory\nYeah we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you\nSure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of Columbian quite a few times a following runoff but anyway uh my father died and\nThree months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before they liked the world cup my father was there\nYou came in the bedroom sit down on the bed mom soon enough he heard gr kissed or said honey everything's gonna be All right but it's beautiful in the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional as well they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that there's sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative ghost goes goes scary scary it's\nNot like that and realize it's going to join the Bronx I'm just going to George how are you know\nGood I'm Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full upper rich and we've seen um [noise]\nYeah the um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental under channel of communication going on between the go sleep deprivation and the recipient of the goes to experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously is discipline\nOh a communication to wake communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing and I had\nA full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having a writer's block on his song not related destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm [noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em\nAnd uh it's it's during the day or at the foot on my bed I and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into all that um can you maybe a lab on what\nCould have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was he this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away\nA it's a ... before you know maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question then we'll get back to the first question so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and and the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench you find the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something it's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that hum unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he has this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions\nAnd then you know wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there's some sort of like I'm understanding or ... or the or reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to do studies sprinting\nOr to go study is available at

you know and and and the cut off was before we had those those two big two days of drops yeah that was like\nWhoa whoa that's not bad\nYeah yeah yeah well now if you're given a little bit of it back but the thing I Would tell you you know you're a young lad and you have you've got a long time to go a so not to worry but\nAs the short term I think you're in the campaign and you know for a lot of

you know the market is right up and down yeah actually it goes up but uh you have to be willing to take the pain\nYou have to and and you have to look long term and unfortunately if you are retiring right now this wouldn't be a a good time Barry any idea\nWhat's what's doing this 'cause usually we can tie it to something dollars\nTrump itself Trump okay [laughter] do it in order to is I don't even want to tell people what they're going to hear on CBS or not but\nWhat it is really though\nAnd it is\nAsia the their economy is slowing down there being obstinate about this trade it was really the issue Jim ... with people you know people always call it a trade war it's not a trade war so much as it and intellectual property that\nWar right now we are are have stopped feeling I write write stop stealing\nOur you know they're doing rebroadcast so the gym please don't show over there and I'm not getting any royalties\nOh you're not I I'm getting [laughter]\nYeah it's totally\nLet me even negotiate you're caught down you know buried\nPennies on the dollar a year yet from it from my royalty so right it's finally the United states saying\nStop stealing our stuff yeah\nYeah yeah ... stealing it\nJust comes at an inopportune times\nBecause of the terms you know like I Wish this was it was three weeks later I say I just a healthy correct right right now the timing that\nOkay okay so that that's what it is now the the Chinese can help hold out forever berry they really can't right\nWow they can do that's the problem uh they're they're communists\nWell no but what they don't have midterms but they still have to rely on other people investing in their country like a an investor who invest internationally and says yeah I'll put up some money toward that factory you want to build\nRight right well here's the challenge is you know they they so far Jim they said screw you know they're they're not negotiating they're not having conversations yeah they're being obstinate\nAnd and again you know it's hard to argue with the president's position because these people are the I ... if if like somebody if your next door neighbor kept\nComing into your house and taken all the fridge out food out of your fridge Shiite ... eventually get ticked off about it what they're doing right they're they're walking into their neighbor's house and they're stealing and they expect that it's okay and they were just going to turn the other cheek well they got a president who is not going to turn the other cheek\nYeah I got it childcare costs what's going on their\nHoly smokes up seven and a half percent over the last year and it's a wonder people are having kids you know birth rates at record low levels ship it it never came back after the recession of two thousand and eight and I think a large part of it I guess Danny can give his perspective but\nI think a large part of the reason is you want to take your kid daycare especially in Massachusetts You're talking Fifteen twenty grand a year per child\nYeah I like Mike ... smart I get my parents did you get built in he's got a built in daycare kind of like your um Wednesday afternoon you know
