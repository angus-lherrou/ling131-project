I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg ah\nOkay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry\nThe the the theory of a lost civilizations starting something ... and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk that's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of\nYou know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were lying to you know the bell SARS for Ryan a dating to zip peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so I end the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the red pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a new phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating

mean who else would say that she has strong evidence that she's got native blood\nBut the Boston Globe they broke the story so she gave it to them right so they would write the lead that everybody else would copy\nBut when you read the article you find out the chances are she's not one thirty second native she's won five hundred and twelve native\nThat's won five hundred and twelve native\nDanny daddy is point\nTwo percent yeah isn't it do the math I think ... you know that's point two percent\nThat would be funny to that is point two percent so as long as the three yeah\nYou point two percent so if you take a test a DNA test and it shows that you are one percent\nNative\nYou are more native that Elizabeth Warren and I I Would check the box is she checked the box\nWith point two percent native\nBut I think one is your five times more native\nThan her anyway something came up that confirms what I've said about Elizabeth Warren for a long time\nI had said that she was an odd person an odd\nAnd really not personable she isn't and that will destroy her in running for president no matter how much the media tries to prop per up\nWhen she runs against Trump in twenty twenty if she gets the nomination no matter how much they try to proper up she just does\nSenator Dole is with the war has released a DNA test to provide strong evidence yet a Native American in her family tree\nThat's all you'll see us to read the article to find out that\nThis person goes six to ten generations back and couldn't make Kerr won five hundred and twelve Native American\nWhich wouldn't be point two percent Native American point two percent Native American which which she used to check the box\nPoint two percent\nPoint two percent just keep saying that to yourself and when your stuff comes back from ancestry dot com if it says one percent\nAmerican indian or indigenous then you should check the box by not giving you advice legal advice or advice for human resources or whatever but she checked the box\nFor point two percent\nNative blood\nBut there's your headlines for the day telling me I mean I'll tell you what I Want you to call tomorrow and I want you to tell me how many times how many times during the day you hear those are the Lauren vindicated Elizabeth Warren ... point\nTwo percent\nGrace grace grace grand mother born in the late seven teams hundreds this isn't proven I mean that's what\nThis scientist in Georgia came up with no she didn't go to ancestry dot com she didn't go to twenty three and me she went there\nAnd she got an expert to do it and who did she gave it to see because if you gave it to any other news organization the headline would not be there's strong evidence that line would be Elizabeth Warren point\nTwo percent American indian\nBut she gave it to the globe now let the spin\nBegin and speaking of spin we've got so much news speaking of women running for president because\nThe only hard evidence that comes out of this DNA tests is that she's definitely running for president remember when the Berkshires eagle one of the most liberal newspapers in this state didn't editorial and said look\nSenator Warren take the test\nIf you're not native you'll have time to deal with it if you are then you'll be able to shut up Trump he'll shut up Trump with point two percent\nBy the way just for the record I was one of the first\nRadio people to say I will pay for the test\nAnd kind of glad she went off on her own\nBecause what if she'd come to me and said\nYeah you can pay for the test ... you know I'm figuring Ninety nine bucks right nothing ah I'm sure this guy was a little bit more expensive but anyway speaking of women running for president Hillary Clinton\nYeah I Know how can we miss you if you will go away but I don't want you to go way Hillary Clinton on a CBS Sunday Morning yesterday asked about Bill Clinton and the meat to move freshmen\nAnd this solves what role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct ... no well\nThat's a lie right there that's ally so many people from the inner circle have written about the bimbo ruptures unit\nIn the Clinton campaign and she had it up and her job was to destroy women who came forward and discussed\nRelationships either consensual or non consensual that they had with Bill Clinton next point remember James Carville they're good friend\nThat's what you get when you're dragging a dollar bill through a chain of pot right you're going to tell me you Hillary nothing will know she's a liar\nI take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also has to know Hillary seat listen you can say that hadn't you divorced\nBill let me let's let's be honest about Hillary here use the majority of this or the audience here doesn't like Hillary right\nI mean come on it's kind of the deal with there being a woman you know what\nI said this to a friend over the weekend when this came out I Would have respect\nFor Hillary Clinton if she had long ago booted his ass out if she had said I Am done with this\nI Would have had respect for her wouldn't have changed how I felt about her politically and her ideology and her her insatiable hunger for power and money\nBut I Would have said hey we she's got her house in order hey remember that's what Michelle Obama in two thousand eight when her husband\nWas running against Hillary for the Democratic primary and the nod to be the presidential candidate on the Democratic side she said I mean you can't keep your house in order how you're going to keep the country in order that was basically saying you got a husband who's a dog and you can't keep them in check\nHow are you going to deal with everything else she was right but I Would have respect for Hillary it if tomorrow I mean it's kinda late now but if tomorrow she said I'm done with them\nI guess I wouldn't believe it 'cause I'd say I'm just doing it gives you want to run for president twenty twenty and you figure this will work\nSaid by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today have said he should as step down\nRetrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now or are there are people who look at\nThe incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship\nSevere punishment if the Saudis are involved in it that uh they immediately shot back and said after the United states and impose sanctions or other political pressure they would respond with even greater action and they're holding some pretty good cards and there's poker game right now\nWhile the cards are and we're talking with Bill them for the cards are a crude ... what do we call light sweet crude [laughter]\nYeah yeah uh it hey they they're the biggest producer an OPEC they have a lot of influence over other OPEC countries or they could tweak this oil supply and as a matter of fact oil prices are already going up just on the outside cats at there could be some type of\nA punishment done by the United states to Saudi Arabia and the other part of this is\nA gym that they uh they have a stake where the United states economy they just made a big military park is the United states is that in jeopardy now there there's a ... this is a very delicate thing for the president and State Department to handle\nBill I'm Glad we got you on the foreign desk is always a pleasure bills him for

the latest addition to the Armstrong family\nActually she's doing well\nThat's great I'm so glad to hear that All right luck um she's got to start planning for retirement right away I was going to say okay so here's the thing we're all living a lot\nLonger yeah how long realistically should people plan to be alive and retirement\nAnd it's kinda odd question asked by a wave your turn sixty five on average people are going to live about Twenty years and mental about shorter women all a bit longer up on but what that it doesn't account for that one in four people a quarter of us will live past the age of Ninety\nAnd one in handled lifted Ninety five so I mean when you're when you're really\nIf you really need a plan for Thirty years in my opinion of retirement that uh you know nearly as long as you're in the workforce and medicate\nThat God okay or pensions defined benefits pensions pretty much disappeared these days yes um how are you really going to know okay I've got enough money I see all these commercials all this stuff that people trying to sell me stuff but what's the straight story\nI mean there's no perfect answer but a few different ways to look at him and first off yeah pensions there's fourteen percent of people these days that actually have a pension and retirement so a very small minority of I still get pensions most of us the only fixed income coming it's going to be Social Security [noise]\nYou know it there's no perfect ruined it really comes down to budgeting and you know figuring out what your true needs are but it's your turn sixty five and the amount that you're going to need from your portfolio you're totally invested assets is less than four percent\nYou're on the right track if you're looking at your money and saying hey you know I've got a [noise]\nYou know half a million dollar portfolio and I need fifty thousand dollars a year not to fund to my retirement I can tell you that you are you running on the very high end there and going to be difficult said there's no perfect answer but there's some rules that found that can really be applied here\nOkay and those are some this is great that was just wedding the appetite fakes there's every month the Armstrong advisory group comes out with a free guide and it is free there's no obligation they don't bother you and it's got great information like this who put some more meat on these bans Mike how do people get a copy of this guide\nFast as he his way to go to our website Armstrong advisory group dot com you can download it right there and media lay uh but you get off and give us a call uh who wants to mail it out that number eight hundred three nine three or zero zero one\nDid you hit me with that again\nAmerican indian not even one percent the zero point two percent American indian\nWow so you can check the box\nWith that she unfortunately all of the headlines today are not going to say that I I mean you've been watching Fox my old the Fox station in Boston where I worked in the end the banner just\nSays I'm a native ... and it says Native American which is a term I again people should not use American indian she's it it says\nDNA to release his DNA tests that proves the ad Native American ancestor that's all you need it right and then everybody's like oh\nAgainst Donald Trump was wrong [laughter] not at all\nI bet ah we could find that Danny is point is zero point to Icelandic right Danny just for the size alone I Believe it well that's right yeah you could be you could be\nWe're going to get into that we're going to get into Kanye West in the oval office and just how disgusting the left media has become I mean how they're racist\nAnd the end\nThey joke about people with mental illness right it's okay to joke about Donald Trump\nBright ... when he did the thing when he was um he was mocking that reporter and everyone said Disney realize that reporter is handicapped him and he's doing it in a way that mocks the handicapping that reporter no that's all right they're coming right out mocking people with mental illness\nBut first say oh we want to get this\nCandidate in here quickly it was a Republican who happens to be from long meadow happens to be running for Hamilton County register deeds are taking on Democrat Cheryl Coakley Rivera and I'm joining us now\n... good morning Marie thanks for joining us this morning\nGood morning thank you for having me uh it's my pleasure so what are you gonna do with the Hamdan a county register or deeds office\nWell I think it really unimportant now if I call it the last line of defense for your property right and I think it's important for us to have the right person in there with the qualifications especially in these day and age wherever there's more and more challenges it keeping your they say\nOkay so how do you plan to go about doing that\nWell I think it's right now they're going to have new software that's going in there and it's important to work with all the stakeholders involved to\nMake sure that the processes transfer correctly but I think we also need to take that information and the resources from the county wide office and give it back to the cities and towns right now the the bath and formation I'm valuation occurring on a daily basis that\nThe data that's collected needs to be sent back\nNot on a yearly basis but on a weekly basis to help the town I'm from Fifteen million dollars that's collected and that often every single year and it's I Know that it's going back to Boston except for a small portion of it I think we need to start bringing more back to the towns and cities so they can help protect their property and evaluations\nButchering of Republican Murray into leads and she said from long better Republican running for him and county registered deeds done whereas uh the seat held by a Donald asked so finally they how do you plan to take on beacon hill and say hey we want more of that money to stay here\nOr they have you with the conversation begins with a secretary a top line that money's going back there that decisions are being there working with the other days office but often we can look at legislation or they transfer attack that could probably the most difficult to transfer to move back in town there's already a home\nA rural mail coming out of prominence and that is asking for a portion of that money to stay in Providence town so I don't think this would be an unusual\nA request make and I think when I start working with our legislative group immediately figuring that way of keeping out into the town synthetic\nBy Murray where can folks get more information\n[noise] uh go to Marie M. A. R. I. E. that number four de de de ... dot com\nAll right Marie thank you very much good luck to you thank you\nKanye West in the White House and we want on\nWhile we weren't on I read your regular show Thursday and friday and by the way thank you to everyone who pledged we were at trainers hospital for children in Springfield doing the annual radio thought of which we raised two hundred and six thousand dollars that's twenty thousand dollars more than last year [noise]\nUm and we're just so happy and it wasn't really a spy the way we're not taking credit for raising that money we're giving it to you and we're giving it to ... because of the stories are trying to hospital for children\nAre just amazing so double UTA G.
