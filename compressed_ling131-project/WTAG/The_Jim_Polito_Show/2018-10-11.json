stop we actually\nAre going to go to Allentown in play in the Lehigh Valley them on friday there and then they're going to turn around WIPP out than we're all going to come back together and reminding again here on Saturday and Sunday and\nLittle little ready for the weary situation comes Saturday but I I'd have to believe that the home crowd here it's going to get our guys the little extras shot of adrenaline they need\nA ride it it's it's Kevin I have a suggestion what are you guys car pool like put both teams in the same bus all\nGood that worked on 'cause I could go wrong\nAny fine ... save on gas no\nYeah I I mean that would be good and and I can see the need for 'em\nBoth orthopedics and it's a daunting following that trip and and unfortunately I had it all their minimum wage right now they're trying to hospitals for children and I don't think that uh we can help you out here but I Know there are many other fine institutions\nYeah Kevin ... where do you come up with these ideas I'll\nListen I'm just I'm I'm tossing them out there and some of ...\nRight I think he's trying to uh I think he's really trying to imply that on Saturday Night when you come back to the mass mutual there's going to be some problems\nWell oddly I there's no law in those two and a ... beforehand and learn from them than when the guys are walking down a red card that\nBurn introduction I buy them in their hands and all that is something I I personally have never seen it in ... market before and I think that's something that's going to be a real treat for our than to make their way down early\nVote to be about the outcome of your critics afternoon I Would say but the last year when it was eighty eighty five degrees I\nI find it to be a welcome a mind to be a welcome ... what's your
