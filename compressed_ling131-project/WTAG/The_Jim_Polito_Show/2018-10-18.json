things\nFrom seniors\nOr the disabled who are already have them\nWe're talking about the future of viability of these programs they can't continue to grow at the rate that they're growing at my luck I I've for most of my life have thought\nI don't know Social Security is going to be there for me\nAnd and try to save\nSo that an and Social Security was never intended to be the primary source of

and again I'm not talking about the people\nWho the promise was made two\nDecades ago I'm Talking about moving forward I mean I think already in my age group I Can't retire until sixty seven I think\nThat people younger than me the edge I mean it shouldn't grow more life expectancy has changed considerably since the Social Security administration was set up [noise] so anyway Donald Trump's nickel plan\nAnd get rid of it if a person can do it in their personal life if I said to you tomorrow you ever got to cut your household spending by five percent you could easily do it\nYou know that you could it would take discipline\nBut five percent wouldn't really really he wouldn't hurt you that much\nBut because the government is somebody else's money\nWe're always oh no the no no big deal but when it's your own you can do it\nI think it's a good idea now get ready for the other side of this from the Democrats which is the ... the they're gonna take away this from grandma and they're gonna you know and we'll get ready for the commercials of a of a Republican pushing grandma for cliff in a wheelchair\n'cause that's what they're going to do with it if I were Trump I wouldn't have brought this up before the midterms but hey he doesn't follow the\nUh the rules he does it is right and so far he's been successful okay Elizabeth Warren and Jeff deal that Elizabeth Warren just give Jeff deal a lucky break kind of like the one the red Sox got last night\nThat's our topic when we return and you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space gel Jim what you think\nIs frankly I don't think I Am still more intelligent Elizabeth Warren ... again ... ... what you are saying about me\nGo back to retirement Bernie borough or all done with the Barney ... okay you and your husband go grow some caught up in Maine will you please anyway\nShe gave a gift to Jeff deal\nLet's start at like this Elizabeth Warren who who literally came out with the DNA report that said uh you have a last name is blood in you\nThan the average person of European descent I mean come on well why don't you think what they're someone in the room when they did this test\nWasn't there someone in the room who said he really think you should go with that like\nDanny you Lloyd's the war like where you were talking about the show or something if I came up with something really half baked you guys or to have my back and say I don't know gym do you really want to do that do you think that's you know we we discuss\nWhat we do in the show every day\nIn John too like input from John like do we he sure you want to take that position or I don't think that was a great segment\nSomebody didn't say\nSenator um\nI think we should throw this away right now\nAnd we should pretend it never happened but no she jumped up she jumped up and said we're going to get this out there we're going to produce a video\nAnd then Monday morning she tweeted about what Seventy times no no no that was over thirty times like in the course of a couple of hours that desperation like trying to make all these points trying to hit a Trump meanwhile your own party is saying\nWhat are you stupid\nSo did she give\nJeff deal\nA gift well if this were any other state I Would say yes here is it\nGoing to be enough to push Jeff deal over the top well the problem is you've got so many\nOf the the Kool Aid drinkers the Warren Kool Aid drinkers\nBehind the tofu courting one twenty eight you know Ninety five and then of course up in New\nHampshire and Franklin County and get a lot of the warring Kool Aid drinkers scary tough\nHere is what will\nHere's what we'll let you know\nJeff deal has a chance\nAnd it goes back to the Scott Brown experience here's what we'll let you know that he has a chance\nI remember Scott Brown sitting in this very studio when he was running against 'em more Healy\nAnd yes he came up here and the the green pickup truck remember the green pickup truck and I remember saying this\nGuy's got a chance\nTo really get a chance then\nIn because it was a special election when was that it was late fall\nHe had this rally in Worcester and mechanics hall\nThat was huge and I found out that during\nA the the the ...\nMonth leading up to that election maybe two months leading up to election the national Republican committee B. R. and see did some polling in Massachusetts and said wow\nI mean Scott Brown is surging this this guy\nFrom rent them\nGood actually when the Senate seat they started pouring money into the race I don't think Jeff deal is getting a lot of money from the air and sea they're spending it like in North Dakota where they think they can unseat the incumbent Democrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp\nThe poor and ... and it's working because the polling well it's chicken or egg\nShe was slipping in the polls and that that that brings in national money\nI don't know if like Scott Brown\nThere's polling that shows and and it would take a we'll take another few days to get some good pole and what what was the impact of Warren's debacle with the DNA on this state wide race\nI mean it's really hurt her and the national race to become president twenty twenty but in the state wide race will it make a difference last polling I saw double digit lead she has over Jeff deal is that going to shrink\nSo the real point is like what Scott Brown if we hear that are in the money is going to Jeff deal and we'll find out will know just like we did but Scott Brown you know that that won't be a major secret when we hear that will say well\nJeff deals chances just increased it would be interesting and\nI think no matter what Jeff deal goes up in the polls right now he is the Republican facing Elizabeth Warren in the election we can get two debates\nComing up and I know that the western mass news consortium has one coming up I don't know if it's this weekend maybe it's\nA Sunday we'll get back to you on that\nThere's one ah tomorrow night I think to they've got to debate it will be interesting to see how Geoff Diehl handles this remember Scott Brown when he ran against Elizabeth Warren and she defeated him he would call her professor Warren\nHe talked about the Indian\nA question\n... interesting to see what Jeff deal does like what his people\nAre telling him\nRemember Holly robust shot she used to be on the show Holly robust shot\nIs running his campaign\nAnd she's she's tough knows type you know throws elbows I Wonder what they're saying so what to watch folks wait and see\nIf money goes into Jeff deal from that and I'm not talking about just like you know a a a little bit attribute you know just to make it look good I'm Talking about ... mommy mommy [noise]\nThat's what happened a lot of money went into Scott Brown's coffers from the national Republicans then they've got it all believe me they got the money to pour into a race like that\nAnd other Senate Republicans would have money to give to just like Richie Neal spreads money around to people so that other members of Congress so that they'll vote for him for a leadership position if they ever regaining if Democrats ever regained control the house other\nRepublican senators would give money to Jeff deal not that some haven't already but I'm Talking about more than just a little tribute I'm Talking about real money keep an eye on that\nVery very important something else it's important\nThis situation where\nA permanent resident\nWho was\nAs everyone believes by Saudi operative who's a journalist to this situation is heating up and the Saudi Government no matter what um\nSomething has to happen to the Saudis and that's a very delicate line for US President to walk very difficult I'll say this is different about Trump at least he's being honest about\nWhy we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nBills emperor when we return and you're listening to the gym please do show you're safe space\nThe Jim ... show I like you because your special we appreciate what you've done the bravery that you're displayed and the love that you have for your country this report\nFrom the W e a G price chopper market thirty to traffic center\nWe had a crash earlier for Ninety five north near the turnpike now we've got another one this one for Ninety five north just before exit Twenty one west main street\nCoal eight five five four zero three nine eight or six\n...

you will um you'll be able to hear that podcast plus a lot of other great stuff from the show\nTaste but Red Sox kind of a big deal\nIn the air you'll see us championship\nWill see speaking of sports and you know we speak of politics here this is interesting ESPN\nOr as a Steven Danny refer to it the four letter network has they hate it and one of the reasons they hate it is it's cross over into politics and that's one of the reasons I hate it well the ESPN President Jimmy ...\nCompletely gets it he said in an interview\nFor the sports Business Journal Wednesday\nWhat I've heard consistently from day one of getting this job and he as a matter of for a long is the more when you lean into politically charged commentary the more we are alienating not just our core fan but are casual fan that's like\n... big light there\nSee with ... and and ... which way it is the politics go\nLiberal why because liberals light to inject politics into everything see politics to me is\nLike watching sports\nThat's how I look at politics um and\nI don't inject politics and to everything else what I I mean I shouldn't say I don't inject it when I see politics and everything else I bring it up like I see politics in movies icy politics and ESPN\nI see it places I get paid you know I see politics but ESPN gets it\nEven human leaning left you've had people doing look Danny and Steve are sports guys\nWhen we have a sports issue here they're on board right 'cause old Jim isn't really the sports guy and also this isn't really a sports show\nBut it's news Red Sox fan three one and the American league championship on their way to a pan and that's news and we also discuss news here you know we are news radio\nSo anyway SPN is starting to get it\nAnd um\nIt looks to me like he realizes people are coming to us for sports not for politics and yet the left always wants to inject politics\nInto everything else\nThey do it in movies they do it everywhere got to have a political mess with so\nWhy do the ESPN go left\nWell if you're a regular listener to the show you may be giving the answer right now [noise] because ESPN is basically sports\nNews okay yes you have former athletes working any SPN\nBut you also have media slash news people in who's attracted to jobs and media and news liberals sewing liberals get the Bristol, Connecticut and they start working at ESPN what do they do\nOf course but blame it this is a sports channel yeah I Know about you know you got to you know he had to get some liberal stuff in here\nMuch higher some liberal people\nKnow let's just hire some sports people everything isn't politics identity politics everything think about what liberals to think about every day\nHow miserable they are and how miserable they make your life like what they do with the schools oh you can't do that 'cause that'll offend this person and this I mean they're shoving politics and shoving this stuff down your throat twenty four seven so any SPN\nIt's oh wait a minute we don't have the viewership of people are sick are veering are crap about politics why why do you think I'm Upset about the kneeling for the national\nAnthem the same way that\nI'm I'm Upset about politics on ESPN I turn on the football game I watch sports remember the two guys at the sixty eight Olympics\nThe to track SARS the two black track stars who raised their fists in the black power\nUm symbol\nAt the sixty eight Olympics when the national anthem was being played\n\nI think it was either the anniversary was either today or yesterday of that happening you know they were considered heroes and patriots\nNo you're not knock it off he just won an Olympic gold medal\n\nWhy do you have to bring politics into everything who's bringing politics into everything yes it's them and that's why ESPN had the\nProblem say five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six speaking of bringing politics into places where it doesn't belong I happen to see Tim Ariz Facebook page yesterday [noise]\nYou could learn a lot from a dummy Iowa's governor to marry a clear safety belt\nSo Murray on his face now remember this guy runs the chamber of commerce\nBusiness interests\nBut we all know what he's doing right he's collecting a paycheck until you can get back into politics hopefully people will forget that he took dirty money had to pay a penalty for it he's lucky that there was a Democrat attorney general because he would probably would have been indicted\nSo he posts on his page yesterday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell recently suggested that Social Security has something to do with the deficit\nHere is what Ronald Reagan had to say about Social Security Tim Murray has got up on his\nFacebook page\nReagan a comment from Ronald Reagan at a picture of Ronald Reagan\nI'm defending Social Security right ... it was in Nineteen eighty four okay by the way Ronald Reagan made sure that he attacked people receiving Social Security\nBut anyway first of all Tim Ari you're calling Ronald Reagan really why don't you go on something else he said ... do you agree with everything else he did or did you just want to pull out Ronald Reagan for this\nAnyway Tim Mari chamber of commerce right business interests\nWhat's he doing to it bringing in politics what ESPN do sports what are they bring into it politics\nCan you just leave it alone\nYou weren't politics come here to the show and you get it and there's a lot of other venues for you on sports\nWhile we have we we do sports John includes sports in the newscast and we'll talk about it here but you really want sports there's other places to go\nBut when I hear the sports more on trying to talk politics I say please\nJust like I'm sure when they hear me talking sports they say yeah you might want to turn it over to Danny and Steve and their right\nBut why does the left after put politics into everything Tim Ari gotta put politics into the chamber of commerce\nCan't help it ESPN got to put it into sports\nIt's a left then injects politics interesting\nIt's the right like people like me who try to remove it from everything\nWe've got to academia\nLook at the college is how intolerant they are if
