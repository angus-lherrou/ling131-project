sports professional sports All right now\nWhat's been going on since yesterday well\nAll the bomb sent out in the mail right\nAll of these bombs too\nKeen Democrat and CNN\nNow where do you want me to begin\nBy let me begin with\nThe bombs themselves\nAdam Housley who used to be with Fox News\nWas tweeting last night\nAnd saying that\nThese bombs just don't seem\nDie he's not he's not behaving like a false flag kind of guy but he's saying that\nThey just don't seem real is something suspicious hear\nAbout these bombs\nNow the the immediate conclusion one would draws loses some crazy conservative\nTrying to knock off all these dams including George Soros\n[noise] uh I I Would say it is fair to reach to to ponder that\nI don't think it's fair to\nMake that conclusion of course all you know Chuck Schumer and everybody else and all the media has made that conclusion\nThat and blamed it on Donald Trump I'll get into that in a minute\nBut how do we know it's not somebody\nNot on like the\nPerson who goes into say a bathroom in college and puts up swastikas or anti Muslim\nA white nationalist or a white supremacist\nThere's somebody there's just trying to sow the seeds of\nA conflict and\nHurt the other side\nI'm not being conspiracy theory but in this day and age every time I see something this hobby is this perfect this pure\nI always say [noise]\nWho just wants to make it look like that\nThe I don't know\nWould imagine some people within the government\nThey have an idea or a tool that these\nBombs were similar\nBut there's also reports out there that these bombs were basically inert\nSome say there was gunpowder in them other reports say there was not\nWe don't know\nAnd we'll find out\nNow let's go to step to\nThis is the president's fault\nBecause of his rhetoric okay well if we're to believe that then we have to believe that every time a cop is hit\nBy a minority or killed by a minority that it's Elizabeth Warren's fault because by saying that the criminal justice system is racist from top to bottom\nFrom back to front I think we're her exact words that\nNow in either case it's no one's fault do you know why because people act\nPeople are responsible for their own actions\nIf this is some conservative who's sending these bombs out\nTrying to create terror\nThey're responsible for it\nIf someone beats up a cop\nThen ultimately they're responsible for it even though President Obama said things like the Cambridge police acted stupidly are we going to blame him for everything well there is a culture in this country is not respecting the police that's unfortunately growing but\nWe're going to blame him\nSomething to ponder folks the more important thing to ponder is we're going to open the national calendar in a minute and what do

apply but they're not applying or they don't want to work there at Saddam minority\nFriendly office I'll give you one example one of my good friends\nHispanic attorney only working in Hampton county as the chief trial ... left the ... district attorney's office and quite frankly he was forced out of that office he was treated poorly in that office and went in and this is an individual that left the west or office\nTo take a better job a better job in the hands and county office because he was not happy the way he was treated in Worcester\nSo that's just one example how do you lose an attorney like that\nHow do you lose a top attorney you know you lose a top attorney like that you don't treat them well so that's my opinion again I worked in an office for ten years I worked under my opponent for close to four so I speak from experience\nWhich arguably grooming uh independent running for worst or county district attorney but so\nBlake Roman gets elected what's the first thing I'm going to notice as a citizen that's going to be different I take it you're going to say well Jim I'm going to actively recruit and retain minority staff yes well what else am I going to get\nBack to it as real quickly I Would hire recruiter number one number one I should say number one we're going to change the culture the office I'm going to make it known\nThat our office is actively recruiting\nMinority at a qualified minority attorneys attorneys and I want that actually make the decision the court room and I would hire a recruiter\nTo do that because I Want to diversify that office number two um we were focused the resources of that office on violent career criminals who continue to commit violent offenses that's probably already one and I'm not afraid to say that\nI Will take violent career criminals who committed violent offenses and I'm going to recommend\nPrison time there'll be no probation recommendations for individuals like that when I leave that office and I'll make sure each and every one of my prosecutors are putting those people that meant those types of crimes in prison and when I say violent crimes I include\nNarcotics traffickers because those narcotics traffickers are killing people and that's about as violent as you can get German I promise you and your listeners that under my watch there will be no probation recommendation for violent career criminals who commit our [noise] that's one of the first things I'll do\nHow do you deal with and married Dominic sorrow and I was talking about it chief Anthony Scott nice to talk about it in Holyoke even the governor is talking about it you can make all those recommendations as the district attorney or your ADA can make it\nBut you've got a bunch of judges who aren't going to um who are going to do exactly what they want to do they have a different philosophy how to contend with that and and and if you start speaking out against those judges that only makes it worse\nJim as a good prosecutor you gotta learn how to sell your case you've got to give judges all the information they need and I noticed because I've been in the courtroom for sixteen years so you need to be able to give a judge all the information he or she needs to make the right decision\nQuite frankly I don't see that going on in the ... under the current administration so I see judges oftentimes making decisions that I certainly don't agree with but I see prosecutors not giving the judge the entire information\nTo the offenders entire record the entire facts bringing the victim a witness and to make a statement that appeals to the judges sympathy those are powerful when you bring\nA victim in to make a victim impact statements that can turn the case on its head and make sure a judge does the right thing so that's the kind of thing I don't see going on and that's the type of change that I Would make\n[noise] but where king folks get more information about your campaign\nWell we've got two weeks left or to we vote November sex and I certainly expect everyone to vote for Blake Ruben for district attorney\nYou can reach out to me on my website um it's Ruben forty a dot com you can reach

them throughout the county to come out get out the vote and vote for Blake Ruben for district attorney because I\nAm going to change that office into an ethical office in an office that focuses on violent crime and just one of the thing I don't want to make sure the office doesn't\nOver prosecute I Want to make sure that people suffering from drug addiction don't go to prison and I want to focus on those people that are suffering from substance abuse disorder and get them into treatment and we're going to bring experts in our office on our staff that are going to work with us to save

eight\nI'll go to perform over on the ground zero for online and on recovering from [noise]\n\nThe list is growing now they're investigating a suspicious package center\nRobert Deniro you sent that to me he sent that to me\nYeah I Know I Can't do it deniro a impression I don't know I don't know Steve can seem can you do a deniro impression can you uh Danny definitely can't\nDanny could do a deniro impression if deniro or playing a character who was in a tuberculosis hospital you know the older you do you even know who I Am yeah that's better than mine yeah yeah you send me a package\nYou sent me a package\nThat got on he got on I had already have a packet he's been to a guy and you know what I mean package yeah so Robert Deniro I mean it fits the motif of everyone who's receive them Robert Deniro has been an unspoken\nOr I mean an outspoken critic of the president and um if you were a whack job\nAnd you were trying to get it all these liberals and yeah you would include the narrowing the list I can think of other people uh we were talking earlier this morning that there's a report out that they're expecting a package for\nJoe Biden former vice president I don't know how you're expecting you know like I'm expecting something from prime you know [noise]\nBut anyway I Want you to think about this in two different ways and I'm going to um [noise] I'm going to put some more meat on these bones after the news at the top of the hour we're Steve who is doing humans worked for John Day back I Want you to think about it in two different ways\nOne\nThis is the president's fault I mean that's what I'm being told it's the president's fault while I'm being told that by like Jeff Zucker who runs CNN\nThat words matter well afford really mattered Jeff you you would you would be doing fact checking on a lot of your stories because you guys have screwed up quite a bit in the past two years trying to get Trump\nYou've had to do retractions and then you've refused to do retractions when you've obviously been wrong but okay so words matter I get it Jeff I get it words matter so words matter\nAre we saying that\nNo matter what you say\nIt will cause people to act so every cop who's been shot\nBy a minority\nSince Elizabeth Warren said\nThe criminal justice system is racist front to back are we saying that that ... or she is responsible for all those cops because if you're saying Donald Trump's responsible you have to say\nThat she is responsible\nYou have to and let's get us up by the way it was taken a step further folks from there um\nCould ... if if words that powerful\nSo if we catch this person\nCan they use as a defense Donald Trump made me do it\nI mean you completely take away their responsibility from the individual who ... who acted\nThe ... you can't have it both ways\nAnd that's what the Dems are trying to do here\nI'm Eric Holder or didn't he received one of these packages well didn't he say that when they're down or when they're down we kick them [noise] so anybody who's um who's assaulted by protesting antifa\nThe the ... the mob of can we say well it's obviously Eric Holder's fault and if that person is caught and arrested and charged with assault was shot fought can we\nShould we just exonerate him you see how crazy it is\nIt's all politics\nIt's all politics now\nLet me get to the next step and I'm just going to give you a little bit of a tease with it\nDefinitely is just seen\nA little too\nOf a crime\nAnd what I mean by that is no not like uh the the person won't be caught I mean I I think ultimately the person who will be caught it took a long time to catch the Unabomber but since then\nWe've\nWe've developed ways to be able to really catch someone for doing this doesn't seem a little too perfect\nKind of like when when somebody spray paint a swastika on their house and then you find out that their\nCans of spray paint in their trash\nWill get into all that after the news you're listening to the gym police do show your safe space why\nWho wrote it\n... that would have been leveled at my ... the Jim ... show there has been a private relationship for a living room\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNeed a mortgage security for its mortgage officer variety mortgage products\nFor you to think about\nThis whole\nSituation I'm an implied is that isn't the sick and twisted and awful\nBut that that's the implied obviously and um we don't want anything bad to happen to anyone no matter how we feel about them politically and that's ridiculous but see if you heard a a little something 'cause I I gave a taste of what I'd like to talk about which is it just seems to perfect\nAnd and I don't mean perfect like I like it or the perfect in his successful just like all of these people not Robert Deniro we find out this morning a suspicious package went to his place it just George Soros it just seems to perfect but what to do here Steve\nWell I got to admit that we don't really know anything until we have we have suspects yeah thank goodness none of these have actually gone off by um I just when when\nYou mentioned that it's just too perfect I mean I Am a maybe it's just 'cause I I'm a skeptic of everything and now in the world we live and I'm even more skeptical of everything that happens\nUm and I I don't necessarily disagree with your questioning of it I I think that we've you\nKnow my first thought when you were talking about this was the article that came out the New York times that was written by some uh you know mold and the Trump Administration and who is who is the more we got to track down the mall we got to figure out this whole thing and then two days later it wasn't a story anymore we have no idea who that was we don't seem to care\nI'm so that I don't know what suspicious to me at the time and we didn't get any resolution on it so I I don't I don't know every name that comes out and every bomb that is found on detonated\nA I guess as a news person and just as a skeptic to me uh that makes me just a little bit more cautious as to what was the motivation behind all that\nYeah I mean I'm certainly not\nHoping that something like this happens but don't you think it's unusual\nThat none of the bombs have gone off I mean of course if the\nPerson went online and got instructions on line and did something wrong and it looks like they're all coming from the same person and they're all the bombs appear to be all the same I mean again where\nYou can't rely on all the information you're getting because some of its leaked summer visit of it is from unnamed sources all this but\nIf they're all the same than they might have made the same mistake in all of them or I or did the person say I'm going to make something that looks exactly like a bomb\nJust to scare you\nTo really really scary you but I'm not going to actually use the bottom like someone who goes into a bank with a toy gun\nThat you're still charged as armed robbery but it's it can be different because you actually don't have a gun but the other side of this is what what's been going on in the country every whereas this fake stuff\nYou know a a home has swastikas painted on it and then we find out later\nChances are always the person who live there you know college campuses you know a white supremacy a literature was distributed ... you know I don't buy it because so many of you know a woman in a Muslim her job so she was beaten by a bunch of guys with Trump paths\nWho are driving a pickup Enrique ... beer\nAnd then we find out she made it up all of these things make me skeptical of this\nBut what I don't think is productive is blaming the president and not because I was saying I defend everything the president says I've made it quite clear on the show there are things he says I don't like\nI like substance a lot I Know like some of the things he says\nBut if you're going to do that and like Jeff Zucker has come out swinging about this I mean Chris Cuomo on CNN hugs and kisses Don Lemon you know talk about dramatics last night you know we're live real live let me tell you something\nAnd I only told this story I think once\nOn the air at Fox twenty five okay look we all know it's scary to be in a circumstance where wow I was in a building or a bomb came into it you know OK guys but you know what you were in the news business don't over dramatize this\nI was standing\nOn the very spot\nWhere the first bomb went off at the\nMarathon bombing\nWas standing on the very spot where the first bomb went up about an hour before it went off\nOkay I was standing there on that spot an hour before I went to I never saw I\nNever thought twice about it like oh my God I could have been killed you'll be standing there an hour before a one off or ten years before it went off it doesn't matter you weren't there when it went off\nOr what if I could have I hate that dramatic and frankly you know I'm bringing up the story just to make the point of east to knuckleheads hugging and kissing on the air over you know this thing\nIt's all it's all showbiz it's all crap\nYeah of course it's a terrible thing to have a bomb come into somebody's building you should be scared but don't give me this all the bomb came into our building and we're lucky to be in their attacking us because we're the media see but just makes me sick\nAnd it's and it's ... you mentioned the dramatic solve it and like one of my biggest problems with NBC among all of them is that they\nTheir little bottom of the screen thing that they put on is way more focused on being cute and finding something funny than being accurate which is dangerous down and you know even last night I I tried to watch\nThe first twenty minutes of Lester Holt to get the story and you know\nThey you know they they put the words\nA dangerous rhetoric or you know whatever the calf raises yeah with a picture of Donald Trump card or you know doing something and I'm like well what wait a minute like slow down here like it they the connection that\nJust make blatantly to again people that aren't as informed as you and I and our listening oh yeah just the average people going about their day coming home and turning on the six o'clock news\n... like ... ditch just so um that to me is is fake news without being fake news that is you know the the the underlying problem here is that people only pick up the news in tiny little snippets and when it's something that is as\nAnd uh it's just unfortunate situation\nIn and the thing is and quickly before I let you go I mean we don't know for a fact that there are actually any explosives and they're doing\nWell at this point or the the lab guys down at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia are working on the now the initial report or that these were viable devices that included\nA charge as well as a other items like a shards of glass or nails that would be a more damaging of course oh we're assuming at this point that they were viable explosive devices\nAlright bills him for a national correspondent bills same time same channel tomorrow sir\nWell beer jam packed thank\nYou All right we've got Steve ... with the news and then we come back

real question is though why why am I hearing from Jeff Zucker head of CNN that this is all the president's fault that that's how pull right now if you believe that\nSomeone was motivated by the president's words to do this let's just think of it logically so you believe that there's somebody out there\nWho feels that the president's speaking to them and has told them go out and do this so you go out there and you attack the president for it\nAre you actually encouraging that person to do more I'm just using your own logic against you Jeff Zucker\nBut aren't you and if you believe that somebody did the really the president is responsible for getting this person to do this well now if they're so devoted to the president\nThat they would do this\nYou're attacking the president there's going to be more\n'cause you just motivated them\nThey didn't get there they didn't get there I'm desired result\nYeah I Know it's insanity paid five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six let's

someone who wants to be the clerk of corks for worst or county Republican Joanne Powell good morning Joe and thanks for joining a gym thanks for having me no problem I'm Glad you're here okay so you know what for everybody I Know you're running in Worcester county\nBut for everybody because just about everybody is facing this right now or ... to make a decision and the election of a sex clerk of course it's a it's an elected position and what do they do\nThat's the biggest question and getting out you know the last nine months and now I'm the classic like is the manager appearing on yup ... prosecutes the scariest ... rapes other felonies yep and then on the ... like twenty five thousand dollars now packed National Labor relations on those kind of you\nOK so anything that's serious gets the superior court is opposed to and I'm not to confuse everybody\nDistrict court right at least as the misdemeanors and under you know the um small claims type\nOf law claims types of cases so far suing someone for over twenty five thousand dollars or to malpractice case I'm going to superior corn\nUm the ... the\nAggravated assault and battery obviously murder those types of cases they go to okay\nAll right so in ... county you're running a county size ... population was a good sized county here in Massachusetts from\nFrom border to border sixty cities and towns county in about two hundred and sixty thousand voters\nYeah now the thing is right now that seat is held by Democrat and it's Dennis McManus now why did you decide to run against Dennis McMahon\nUh for the past three and a half years I worked at probate in family court as a manager head administrative assistant with register fat meant before that I went to the district attorney Joe early is also running um before I had the department of revenue I have my MBA from assumption college but down the street I'm\nThe reason Iran is when I've been there for three and a half years and what we found it probably in family court is\nUm they really behind the times technologically um we're only fifty miles from Boston but the technology and then most efficiency\nProfessionalism training hadn't really moved towards the west or area okay some of the things like payroll there was a play about Iraq or doing her payroll manually an spreadsheet up the spreadsheet she's teaching me how to do it she spent twenty five thirty hours a week making over a hundred thousand dollars working on payroll\nFollow the payment system had been automate in two thousand twelve in the state I went to Boston I was trained that takes a couple of hours a week to do payroll so now I Do the payrolls we were able to move her to the lawyers language is dealing with the lawyers right\nDoing cases that she should be handling and not spending so much time so what I Want to do some very clear to help the staff be more efficient bring it you know bring them into the twenty first century\nGive them the opportunity to better serve the community these are very important cases we don't want people you know who's ever a crime committed against them we don't want anything messed up we want it to the judge as perfectly as efficiently as possible as quickly as possible and not have any of these trials or anything behind [laughter] thing happen like that\nNow you're talking about because I Know the average person would say hey I'm not going to court you know I'm not going to commit a crime or\nHopefully you won't be a victim of crime so what difference does it make to me how efficient the court is but I guess what you're saying is the difference is yes for public safety and yes for tax dollars being resources being properly allocate it exactly\nThere's a lot of money being spent on sports right now and the less I mean\nThose are the more efficient the staff as the less we would have to hire although you know what I mean it would save money that way you do it um the general population does have to come in for jury duty so even to the jury duty more efficient to make sure they're not coming in and wasting their time to reach out to them with texting or whatever\nTechnology we happen to have at that moment so that they're not sitting there all day not me not being needed or not even having to come in that day is a case got continued or something like\nThat is that you see that as the real problem and the author of us I mean why aren't they doing that now\nUm trial court we're all under the umbrella trial court for the state of Massachusetts a sixty six hundred employees is forty eight courthouses but then we run independently the clerk is the one who determines how the office is run and it's just a matter of\nA different management style hands on manager or a hands off manager for the most part I'm it's my understanding that McManus has allowed his staff to run the office which is fine but that means nobody's overseeing nobody's initiating these changes that could be riding in over the last twelve years that he's been there\nOkay and that's where you feel you can make it that I Know I I mean the tracking time is supposed to be Eighteen months\nAnd I know now when you say dragging them explain that to be both 'cause I Know what it means being a reporter but what it means to be\nPut each case has when something happens each case has to be initiated has to be started docket go through the process hearings motions all that\nIt should only take or it should do its best to get within Eighteen months have it from start to finish up um cases right now it's only three four five years yeah that's not acceptable and unacceptable that's what I Want to bring down I Want to a you know\nAddress that if it's a something civil let's mediated and get it out of the Oregon moving along if it's criminal let's get it moving right away you don't want somebody sitting in jail that shouldn't be sitting in jail right certainly don't want to victims' families Andrei long over and over again\nYeah I look at it from that perspective myself the most is that I don't want somebody having to wait for or something like that yeah it does bother me I'm Joanna where can folks get more information about uh about your campaign and where you'll be\nI've been am everywhere so not only I've gone to every parade every festival um you know push crossing the county ... gang I go to events I saw you you know I've seen you several\nTimes there yeah Benson into yeah and they weren't political event or just something else\nYou know he just going to reach out to the population but my website if anyone wants more information at ... dot com Powell for clerk dot com that's pretty simple yeah and I'm On Facebook and Google and you know everything it's easy to get in contact with people nowadays\nOkay well we appreciate your time joined power Republican running for clerk of courts worst or county and I hope that everybody whether you live in Worcester county or not has a better understanding of exactly what that office is all about and yes the maybe some people are saying I didn't even know was\nUm an elected office but it is\nIt had been many times you know many many years ago way before we've been around\nYeah it was that's that's the way that they set it up that's the way that they set it up\nBecause I could just encourage everyone to get out and vote early voting started already and on election day is November six twelve days away idea he can vote for the ... circuit courts and the second the last one on the ballot appreciative of\nAll right thank you very much Joe and good luck to
