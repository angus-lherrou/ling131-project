the Minority Report kind of weird can't speak to that but um I'll give it some thought\nHere we go ... book random question for a poll\nWhat if God Forbid remember this coming to us from official team bucket Gmail dot com or what if God Forbid there was another attack like nine eleven would we do the whole Iraq invasion thing again to another country trying to hunt the perpetrators in their home country or not walk but basically what would be our response in this day and age\nI'm curious because the whole side of situation so let\nMe know um if there was another nine eleven would we hunt them in their home country uh yes\nThe answer is yes Kyle in fact I think if there was another nine eleven we would probably take a more World War two version of what our response would be which is a mass destruction of any area that we think plays a was giving safe haven to them\nUm I think the American people's raft if there were another day when we lost three thousand people in one terrorist attack\nWould be a fearsome and biblical thing that's my that's my sense of it but you know it would depend on a lot of factors Andrew writes\nBook I'm thirty two years old and never voted in the mid

pay to play corruption and complete sense of powerlessness will stay with me forever definitely gives me a healthy love for freedom in our constitution republic\nLately I think Republicans fears of felons voting is misplaced this is purely anecdotal but all the possible lip voters I encountered in prison probably wouldn't go to ... their lives depended on it and not very impressive people that's kind of where they send us keep up the good fight shields high in Georgia Matt Matt ... really interesting to hear from\nA man I appreciate getting a perspective from somebody who has a has served
