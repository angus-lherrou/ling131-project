[noise] somebody in a chat room saying are you trying to print something it's true that if you tried to if you had a corrupt print driver which could cause a blue screen\nAnd every time you build it up and tried to load that that would cause it it's probably do a driver that's getting loaded when you first turn on the computer how far does it get before blue screens\nWell it does still last time it was interesting case before that a few times they gave me some time and I I manage to get a little research in and bad drivers as\nOne of the main colleges yeah and so one of the things I tried\nTo do is go in and modify change out or delete some stop some drivers [noise] but I got confused doing I I probably did the wrong thing oh let me kind of if I ...\nWhat I I Would do here's one diagnostic and unfortunately in windows tenants a different way to do this but if you can start windows ten in safe mode and you\nWould then not load the majority of drivers your screener would look terrible because you'd have a V. Ga displayed reverence over\nAt that last night I got into safe mode\nAnd did it run reliably in safe mode\nWell it did but it saves motives when I was trying to do these correct\nIs yeah you don't want I mean you know when he wants to stay in safe mode but if you can boot up in safe mode usually that means it's something that's loading some drivers loading not in safe mode is causing the problem is so so if it was completely reliable and safe mode\nAlmost always I look at the video drivers so the first thing I Would do is is getting newer video drivers for your machine is is your machine from a major manufacturer\nOkay so go or you might need to do this in safe mode or another computer but go to jail and go to that area for specifically that computer you know you have a Dell um service number used that to get to the exact page\nAnd download all of the drivers for that system and re installed them sometimes that that will think make it say a stapler because then you're replacing those drivers with something more up today\nUm I Would bet that is the first thing I Would do and I would bet that that's what's going on it if you so safe mode ran okay\nIt it did until I started you know trying to do some corrective actions and I was following instruction\nIs it I I got\nOn the Internet [laughter] I don't know I got it from Microsoft okay good that's getting to that is a job in itself I Know voted that\nAnd then I transferred under chrome on my on my own my own book so I still have that available\nYeah but I kind of thing where they have and you do is you know I was so confused I'd have to go it would take me a long time yeah but in a mall and\nYeah there's the problem with doing stuff and you don't know what you're doing it and you can really get to all sorts of mischief that way um\nWell no I I appreciate that and and it's you know my wife has said it's time for you to get a new computer and I said well hopefully I can get this done and I was thinking\nIt might be able to here's a here's the real thing to do once you go in a safe mode\nType uh you know when do skiing type recovery and go into a recovery mode that will let you kind of re install a windows it'll keep your data there's various levels there is one level that will raise your drive\nAnd you'll lose all your data but there are several levels that will let you refresh windows without racing any data and that's and windows ten has some very good recovery mode\nI Would definitely try those you can do those from safe mode\nUh so I Would see you know see if any of those tools you have a reset this PC which is which\nIs pretty good if you do the reset this BC and choose keep my files it'll refreshed the system\nWithout a\nGetting rid of anything you want to keep you have a backup of everything\nI yeah just yeah all my data not worried about my day to have all that\nWell worst case you can wipe the drive and start over she's got a good backup well\nThe thing is I Want to replace the drive anyway within is\nWell now's the time [laughter] I was just a great\nTime and if it now the only problem is if it's a hardware problem other than drivers if it's you know maybe a mother board is your whatever you you might be replacing the drive in the computer will still be problematic but is that it's much more serious and your wife is right and I think given

I ... Fox News Deborah free been lost a friend at the tree of life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh at a vigil in the squirrel hill neighborhood she remembers the Jerry Rabinowitz\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert Bowers\nAre Jewish how serendipitous the Jews save\nThe life of Robert Bowers and if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people\nHe communicated with was he a friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Jeb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions as I have\nAnd so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post were not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated\nThe stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses assassination\nOf Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the facts you know Hodgkinson actually traveling hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd a fat doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out to restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other ... came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised for Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from an ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion\nIs Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite settled a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgusts me\nI Hope soon very soon but a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it tempered thing ... McVeigh for violence\nBowers was a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David re a fair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis\nCaused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border with type ... may souls who cough aids pie or re a diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that but David a\nSenator Susan Collins received the so called rice and white powder this is terrible it's awful ... are you aware of this is going on just the media cover it\nLike they cover the photo bomb attacks\nBy ... not even close both of these events are terrible\nThose responsible should be held to account there's been several arrests of individuals or a Democrat and activists on the left who have sent these substances to the Trump children to the secretary of defense to the president the vice president the press secretary and other Republican lawmakers\nAnd the media knows about it but they don't cover it because the perpetrators you're on the left I Want an equal treatment of all this\nThose in Charlottesville can deal with this for a moment\nThe president said there's good people on both sides you know what he was referring to he was not referring to the tiki carrying torches\nBy the white nationalist and the races marching around shouting racial slurs about Jews or by the way the president's grandchildren are Jewish he was talking about those who want to keep Confederate monuments\nThose who want to keep Confederate ... mind you're much he said those good people and that side and the good people on the side or protesting that think the Confederate monuments out to be taken down but because that charges not explosive enough\nThe left in the media keeps saying that the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill counting hams perspective I\nI don't like the idea of Confederate monuments 'cause they declared war in my country the United states of America and killed something the range of six hundred thousand Americans to by the way those Confederate so did that road Democrats\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight\nWhen the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments and the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist carrying tiki torches\nShouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches\nThere's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your goals were causing Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bottom of the seventh inning of four to one [noise] so uh that's [noise]\nBecause

stronger today than it was two years ago in fact everything it could go writes gone right\nAnd not much has gone wrong\nAnd that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar\nContinue recalls will go right to go to Robin Utah\nRobin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show rub go ahead\nThanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\nWell yeah in the middle of the shooting at Al Sharpton on MSNBC again and I doubt and then again and well [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter] you know well\nI'm not ... how about the riot then Al Sharpton started a New York city based upon the death of a Jewish person what about Freddie's furniture Mart I mean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis ...\nThat's right and and and I I watched it correct to sleep going really a year [noise]\nYeah I can make yourself not with the people of all I'm\nNot I just Google this\nDecember Thirteen Ninety Ninety five the river and our Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed taped show Sharpton is not named Fridays but mentions the least dispute and goes out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton inside of the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart\nBecause a Jewish a small business owner moved into the black community\nAnd so I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on it it's the people for this crap\nAnd you know the other thing is that the guy who is that right to the White House for your time and it was All right and he actually got the castor bean and made rice and\nAnd and this is you're calling from Utah and this is a guy who's now when they're an indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe\nEven a comedian story here in Utah\nAnd second page below the fold\nAnd an all white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story it All right but I don't know just being concoction would have actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder over your hands impose on your lap believe me it is a fearful tear filled event and this is a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and beans and and there's\nA real hot in the ... well can you imagine a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up but you can bring up anything you can say a word\nWell they don't Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox\nA sponsor a play in Central Park\nThat depicted the murder through repeated stepping up Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the ... number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner sponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nWithin a character looking like Trump being chopped the death on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night now\nWhat did the same thing that happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nWhat it would add a comedian who had a rock Obama and how his head bloody head on stage\nKathy Griffin now is touring the country to slow down audiences\nBy explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond\nTo these obvious\nDiscrepancies in disparities between the way they treat different acts the same actors committed it kinda depends against humans conducted thank you for your call let's continue we have ray in South Carolina ran in South Carolina Welcome to the bill Cunningham show right go ahead\nYou're great

magnificently here because of family and faith and academics and hard work the Israeli ambassador to America said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to being anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and no matter what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media depressed CNN and their allies\nAlways lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric and our violence\nBut when progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting a trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins\nOr the children to the president whenever that goes on at no point or progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism\nEven when the president is the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump\nBecause Trump a Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump never mentioning the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole Ferguson and Baltimore all of the race riots\nThe shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left\nNever any connections are ever made between the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter\nAnd then meeting and the White House\nWith those same leadership a black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama\nAnd the media never said wait a minute Mr Mr President how do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops what do we went dead cops when you want them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism one where Republicans speak up\nHave even heard about the guy from Utah who sent rising to the president to kill him ... have you heard about the white powder the rice an attack\nOn the home of Senator Susan Collins by a left this after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children\nHow big of a story would it have been if if the Republicans had attacked the children up or Iraq Hussein Obama oh my oh my lord of the world would end as we know it\nThey are ... too much

Tuesday be mostly sunny with ties right around fifty four gas anytime at WTO ... dot com key word weather [noise]\nI've only counting on let's continue with the tragedies the tragedies this week and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas rescue and former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nHeavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas raskin former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nA very tough situation awful um\nI watch some of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things\nDoor neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I submitted ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting saying that uh that are in fact Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours to go to the set is there any tragedy the Washington Post\nWell not exploit do attack President Trump and the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump has such a on a public defender of Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should have known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic I anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet one I've seen\nIs you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was monitoring his ... his social media is other things he was posting couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the what we always say is if you think say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had this scene and could've alerted the police on the police when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or in a look to see if this guy does have guns\nOr potentially follow him we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old up punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people cold and it wasn't following up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no perfection on horse you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could go on for spring is very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we always did that review of what had happened and what we could do but at the same way that they're doing with the case in the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours\nWaiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago\nYou sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people of like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville\nShouting slurs against ah against Jews\nAnd against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had it goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went and anyway Peter you go right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "29"}
