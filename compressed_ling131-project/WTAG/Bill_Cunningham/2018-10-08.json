Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweat Nick nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular\nNot of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote so said a Senator Susan Collins\nAnd that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job of representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun coming up later on but Patrice Lee ... spent on my show many times\nWrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford\nTherefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse but also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime\nAnd the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness\nAnd the me too movement these values are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven cold there of the Late Show as a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nAerial doom is aerial doom is as a writer on Stephen ... bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nYou see this was never about finding the truth about professor Ford she was used like a three dollar steak\nBy a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that you wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\nWere interviewed it'll be forty more and after that for a hundred more it would never stop 'cause this is all about running out the clock\nTaking control the Senate on November the sex that's what it's all about it's not about fairness or determining whether or not you know Cavanaugh is a Romney slash Bush Republican he's not an Amy Coney Coney Barrett or a judge to par\nI have a sense that cabin always gonna be a conservative maybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock\nRunning over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure but once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team and the vicious lies perpetrated opponent by the Senate by the mainstream media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore north teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false it's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nThat were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door and her house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that would corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out\nAnd an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor forward lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message to other Trump nominees and this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett a judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this ... adjust the judge hardness or wait for you and so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee\nI oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen\nAs container and your calls with calls from Chicago\nIndianapolis New Hampshire Nevada Delaware Wisconsin many other states coming up later in the last hour will be Julie gun lock independent women's forum and also just the leaf Peterson\nLive from Los Angeles and\nLong becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three some still hunting emigrated Mary [noise] why would you ever [noise]\n[noise]\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nCounty ... Columbus Day hunting ... after ... sunny has in the seventies get you for any time I did the ... weather oh\nI've got the great American I'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them to rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham\nTo be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant\nGoing over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen and Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault the\nMost likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply so in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years\nBut she ought to but now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett\nSpun gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have added let's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThank bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party could have pornography industry if you don't mind shore\nYeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but over the years I wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography and the street I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who like women that way\nAbout Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against Trump\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars of the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies and subject getting women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota if they really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of armed with these people because you know the old affect the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women or are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman eight Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turn out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she\nSet in twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin ... is because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore it moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was ... but the but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she sat in twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nOf

and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman\nBut if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man your father was a man what kind of feelings damned towards your husband and your dad\nYour brothers are male what kind of feelings damp toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lies and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up\nAnd it was a line to be ... merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other the fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney\nA take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault I naturally want to believe that person but then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and\nMake sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determine what she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened that how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing the fly was ridiculous in her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up in that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and at one end not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nAnd had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America to South America and Europe\nShe had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth\nThey had a ball face mitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar but then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me what the facts\nThat's what caused the writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nThat is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we ruined his life were ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters\nSo aerial do most of this team of Kobe or show quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life unquote that's where they are\nDon't care about his

going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think there are people like Brian who saw on only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power number two that Democrats\nLooks socialist progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions\nBut damn it they were alive because she lied about flying she lied about the second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about in fact it was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin all in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that route political forces the only way that we are going to be cut and we can avoid a civil war as

city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone\nAnd the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... major maker you watch that fight\nReally getting it affect you today to hear\nEric Holder who still contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned ... notice you have the promise but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process\nDo you recall outrageous do you recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media
