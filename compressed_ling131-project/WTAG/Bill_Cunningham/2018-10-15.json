[noise] uh Kathy Akron, Ohio your next Hi Cathy Lee a report the guy\nThan if you're taking my call thank you it's my pleasure thanks for calling I've been wanting to attack you for a while I had a private hobby\nWhere I collect a landscape photos and um I Would really like find a way to it's like\nHolidays as like it you don't say oh how nice digital trains are usually kind of small and yeah let's have it on the string found out but I don't know how to do that\nYou know it's funny because almost all now these uh Internet connected TV devices like the Roku and the Apple TV have screens savers that are often landscapes Apple TV as a beautiful uh one it's a slow motion landscapes so they're moving because their screen saver\nAnd I saw that on a TV yesterday horse yeah location that I figured it was probably felt the television\nThere comes to the Apple TV it's awesome so that would be one way to do it is to get one of these devices\nAll of them have a photo capability so for instance the Apple TV if you use a Macintosh you upload your landscape pictures to your you put them on your apple photos and you could actually have have a particular folded let's call it my special landscape collection\nAnd you'd say to your Apple TV that's my screen saver\nHow does it get from my ...\nIts magic you know through the through iCloud it's through the Internet and that's the whole point is that you are now now this is not the only way to do it I'm gonna tell you some other way\nBut that's one way to do it and the advantage of that as you can updated without having to do anything and just put new photos in the folder on your computer and the way it works is you've you using the iCloud photo library So Apple the Mac is uploading all your photos to iCloud its its cloud storage\nThat em yeah I can I tell them an apple\nTV it's called the Apple TV [noise] and so the idea is that this is one way I'm going to finish until you smarter ways but it's because it's going to cost you a little money because Apple TV is a couple of hundred bucks\nBut then the Apple TV let you watch movies and TV and and other stuff you know it's the idea is that it makes an Internet connected T. V. C. connect the Apple TV to the Internet now your TVs connect the Apple TV and you've added Internet capability to your TV [noise] many TV's already have this uh does your TV have Netflix army right Gail yeah\nI Do like we we can get on it like it ... it it was\nOkay so it doesn't already have Internet you might investigate if your television look in the menu and see what apps it offers you might already have a photo lab in which case you'd have to just figure out how to get photos to that\nPhoto op lots of TVs have slots for photo cards for S. D. card so that'd be another way to do it requiring no Internet you copy the photos you want onto an S. D. card a little memory card on your lack\nFlooded into TV you can buy your TV doesn't have that you can buy little ad on devices that do that the only the ad on edge steak\nYeah that's the card reader onto your TV and and a USB flash drive it really depends on the television and the capabilities of the TV but many TV's can do a slide show if you put a photo folder in that's Estee carts laughter on the USB port again you'd have to check to make sure you do that\nOr the nice thing about the Apple TV that will work with any TV that has an H y por\nRoku will do the same thing but it doesn't use apples a photo sharing service it you know you could use some other one Amazon has those Amazon fired TVs use Amazon photos and you could put Amazon photos in your back and put the photos and that\nAnd then have them up on your Amazon TV as well lots of ways this ah because what you want to do is very common I see my family photos as a screen saver for instance on my\nToes [laughter] yeah yeah that would be great tip [noise]\nSo you could do that with Roku with Apple TV probably your own existing TV capabilities are there lots of ways to do it and it's in your right it'd be great way to use those landscape photos [noise]\nExcellent thank you so much pleasure\nAnd if you have an Apple TV I stopped putting my family photos on their cars the a normal a default screen saver which they called Ariel is studying\nHey have aerial photography in super slow mo\nA and it just rotate through everything from the urban landscapes of Dubai to ... overhead for LAX to the lush jungles of Hawaii\nIt's kind of like that opening shot of Jurassic Park you know I almost want to play the ethic park thing as they zoom down that valley but they do it's very slowly because it's a screen saver and they want to change it but then I Want to change dramatically or drowsy I so it's just beautiful\nAnd if you have your Apple TV set up with a nice big screen that's gorgeous hey we're at a time I um I I hate it when that happens when you come back next week we have lots more to talk about by then I'll have a new Google phone I can talk about that [noise] thanks to Michael ... he makes that music So Greg doesn't ease our musical director [noise]\nHe's the guy with the baton and the tail\nThinks the Kim Schaffer for answering the phone most of all thanks to you for joining me we'll aboard

five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me so a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you know and I said well\nThank you so I walked hair walked back around came around the corner presidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you I said I'm not going anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here\nSo it came up with ... and nice and easy says he listens to me casually on Sunday night and thanks for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you were going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal Democrat what you're doing is that is fabulous away exchanged more nicely these small talk\nAnd said you ready for it I said let's go so I handed him a Mike and I took a Mike\nAnd I talk to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico\nTalked about the show gay talked about South Korea whenever the issues Kavanaugh whatever it was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run it Sunday night is that I may be listening as well Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview and about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on and we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me\nHit him on two or three months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is\nFor an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but\nThere's no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially for American women some as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN honored Jeff Zucker viciously and racially\nPejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West bakari sellers is a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nStories you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this was an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him\nHe's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Tanya the racial draft they had it with him hey she's spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat citizen uncle\nTom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jessie Molly Peterson and Colin Powell\nAnd Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest\nThe Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration\nWhich is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who crippled the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married\nIt goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said and the sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks\nMaintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS\nTroll black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control where well I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line\nRight and Michael ... who's following Michael ... is doing a great job speaking for the Democratic party it'd be wonderful that guy would stay in the media for the next couple of years it'd be great if it was the nominee of the Democratic party to porn lawyer fits the modern Democratic Party that guy is not a great job\nYou take Julie sweat make her Deborah Ramirez or Christine forward haven't heard from them in a while I have you because the media is done using them to attack Trump or Stormy Daniels was the last time you heard from her\nOr Karen McDougal in love with the president for ten years ago\nAccess Hollywood tape with Billy Bush the comments on John McCain the Khan family Kanye West Jim Brown whatever it is right now it's all about ... some al\nMedia want you to think the president's not responding correctly so the murder maybe I'm a Saudi Arabian and this damn bowl as if the six or seven hundred\nBlacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's today north or the four thousand shot they can't be used in Chicago to attack the president so vague north but whenever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president what they're going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next to this my interview with the president doesn't know the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight\nAlso in about an hour or so we have diamond in suburban are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line much like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern\nDemocratic Party to keep them in line with continued thirty minutes after they are still counting undergrad American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nPatti LaBelle lower forties Monday crowded showers likely Heisman lower sixties Tuesday mostly sunny has been lower fifty get your cats anytime a WTO

high school football game with a relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important so on Wednesday I made a request to the White House to do a short interview\nWhich of the White House should said should be kept her about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes goes the president and I had so much fun so I met the president in a hanger on friday evening and about an hour later he was going to go speak in ah north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County\nAt a at a Republican gathering of which twenty thousand people show up and little Warren County while\nStanding in a field with a light rain and cold dark\nAnd the sun was down it must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president did like a Thirteen fourteen meant an interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what was going on in orange county and then yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and uh and beautiful and I think he's he told me off the\nThe air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had so here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater had it\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships I had swift in\nWith my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers\nSick if I ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no and knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage day ... everything's on what's going to happen with the backing of housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened\nToday with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got back here we got back I it we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama said one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big wall coming up you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure it was very happy\nRight now about your wife is good she's a lawyer to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady in a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you are going to\nContinue to give a lot of money 'cause they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just touch on a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with\nThe trade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just take your car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada's it just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because there was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were sick and so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south\nSo many jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada and Mexico are we talking about a million well you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we can\nThe seller dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\n[noise]\nHey guys can hear from the hip typecast today's growth who would win at three mile bicycle racing eleven year old girl or last year's winner the Tour de

interview with a millennia Trump on friday night and I thought was ridiculous about our hat and a a jacket that she wore in a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media covers that you know\nMedia Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage\nOf Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped in the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I guess it's groupthink because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right\nThirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors house the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative\nWhat CBS what's safe from top to bottom we're going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often was Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conduct it was a regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow\nOne of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that all you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV\nOr a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue\nWe have calls from California Texas North Carolina Louisiana and Ohio\nHave long becomes available

CNN one after Romney manual the way they go after Donald J drop wouldn't that be great\nPlus I Want to get your reaction to the extent of the interview I had with him as opposed to a Leslie stall who kept interrupting the poor guy cautiously never got a thought in edgewise so let's get\nA reaction and more but it's a nice a special night is always great to have on the president first summer I'm at
