in College of former NFL Super Bowl champion signed the most important contract of his life to serve in the Army National guard\nAround a lot of military my family as part of what are my family's overall I Want to go out there make a difference I didn't find that work in ... in the ... and then ... marketing for my country was just like\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard log on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Massachusetts Army National guard here by the Massachusetts broadcasters association at this station\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn off for them food and water clothing transportation\nDriving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals\nFrom the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way and the Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we\nShould encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico\nThere's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth America and Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million when it come here and\nBecause the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they won't permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins legal process it will take years in the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled\nTo have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to herring that goes on and on and on and never stops\nSo uh\nI I'm interested to see when and if the media will change their coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by\nUnbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration federal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable Trump\nHas everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers are not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work and we put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in\nIf you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nTo the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan their vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's\nBut the world in which I live I'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says he's we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become an American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen\nThis has fundamentally changed our country that's far\nAnd it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat the most violent places on earth is sending as largely young males to come into America\nGot a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThis benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join a country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up then demand right\nYou know I I'm\nWaiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any there you know who they are\nTo me the ... narrative as a hustle it's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize is death\nAs a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nI guarantee you he his wife has no more value than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses lie for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time\nIn American elsewhere so why is the death of a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia they don't like that\nAnd I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist so Maui indirectly cause the death of democracy Yogi in Turkey who believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue\nAlong becomes available it never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing\nIs tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivized by the mainstream media and the fact that ... if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is that it was should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind thing give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't because the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us none of brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nThey want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea it must have\nNothing else to talk about how can we do is go right to the [noise] one becomes available you know the routine go hunting and the great American Bar to live with you every Sunday [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the

community and why he was elected do by Fox News for making alleged in temperate comments about some of the women who accused Brett Kavanaugh of a bad behavior then I think it was a lie\nAt a maximum misstatement at the other side but nonetheless let's continue with your calls let's go to a fill in Connecticut an ad in Las Vegas and filling Connecticut Welcome to the bill Cunningham show and Phil how are you\nOr Mr Cunningham how are you are correct Mr Phil I'm doing well please go ahead well here's the thing in Connecticut boom and he's been off require\nThe cabin out hearing grounded I Know for a fact he's working on this caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border and a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of hope they're not by the time spring hits the fan President Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves and he's a real army\nAnd I think the plan is they want to be like another ... ... ... hours because our troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being asked to or don't worry [laughter] or of it like storm the Mexican border a few days ago I Would always put in a a coke and Africa ... twenty four hours or ... for us and deal with Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico archer right all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the truth\nI think there's got to be a part of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be\nThere they're oh it's for the media to maybe we're just all court\n... you're from a Dick Blumenthal he's the war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or NBC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump\nWhere I live in Ohio we don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming come the most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut is illegal immigrants there's tens of thousands of them here thinks that Governor mulloy ... over the past year and a half the Blumenthal every time he's eager to immigrants ISIS above the port someday cold up there her shirt\nBlumenthal shows up at church or other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually the ice or suspense their case shelter future here because of the TV cameras all all the\nTime trying to keep the eagle illegal\nImmigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and get caught you're send back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America\nAnd you say the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing you get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing venue released back into American emotion can be held his fourteen days there's not we're not scale to handle this invasion from most violent places on earth Central America we're not scaled are doing\nIt's continuing ed in Las Vegas Nevada and they add welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI or us national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current current boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also how can a bomb a drone American citizens like this hour we keep guy kill them all up you know ... and then the media doesn't ... thanks very much later they killed us a sixteen year old son\nWell and and it's because you know ... if ... if in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club or against Trump to do it but they're out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed\nWhy not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a cop that are killed on a regular basis no big deal\nAnd in fact that ... that kind of behavior not part of the world is regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much\nBut I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia and when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists and then I hear about the show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN [noise] get do and why why did why more valuable than accounts like\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up look at the head of the past ... who's ... oil as political opponents both Bush and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed to face the supply Afghanistan\nPlus services African Business conference but Obama held rip fifth the African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but\nYou know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR they just fall over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of this spot or dress African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nAnd and you went over that quickly but use backers than had any leader\nWho would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replace you putting around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right to boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nWhy is because people if we if we can come and run their country and give it a look at it would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nAnd you didn't have a gym thank you but here's some factories the violent death rating on doors is Ninety five per one hundred thousand nine of the ten most violent countries on earth or south the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent herself us border the other four are small countries in Africa\nSo we're we're taking in large numbers of immigrants\nFrom those

five thousand kind of under the radar we're talking about tens of thousands more coming at one time were not scaled to do it doesn't work that way\nNo federal law odd to say that upon arrival\nFrom Central America or any other place you're sent back to your country of origin immediately that's not federal law federal law says Mexicans yes\nOther countries you know so if you're from El Salvador Nicaragua\nGuatemala or Honduras or Venezuela and you show up on the southern border instead of ... and running away from the cops border patrol these individuals run toward the police and say in

needs to happen is the federal law needs to be changed with the cooperation of the Democratic party that says when you arrived here illegally you're mainly sent back to your country of origin without a hearing\nThat's it no due process because you're not an American the Democrats\nTend Democrats in the Senate will not allow that to happen they will not allow that change Trump wanted to get the so called dreamers might be twenty million dreamers don't know how many citizenship on the path to in exchange for the border wall to stop it but I can put a cork in a bottle\nBut Democrats wouldn't

government probably that dark shadows\nI don't know what it is is this the one world government is at the door to burgers or the rock child or or whoever\nYou know on that point in about an hour and twenty minutes I'm gonna call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state\nHow that continues it continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop it he's going to make that he made the point in his book that I read\nThat that it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might I agree with\nI Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know the ... the clip protested against governor governor I mean judge Kavanaugh right they were led by the Democratic party for a specific reason they don't want constitutional judges on the Supreme\nCourt oh no they\n... they they kinda want a super legislature they they want judges to impose rules and regulations on us that cannot be passed through the Democratic process\nAnd so they've done that the last thirty or forty years and when you got course itching Kevin all who tell a lie hope become constitutional judges they are going to say wait a minute if you want to convince your fellow citizens stamp abortion or gay marriage or something else\nGo convince them in the legislature passed a law it's OK don't come to us to services second legislature and I hope that the

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nClear those in the lower twenty Monday sunny heightened upper forties Tuesday mostly the chance of showers has the lowest fifty get your cats anytime a W T H ... out there [noise]\nCorey Lewandowski welcome again to the bill cutting ... Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh there there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is\nBefore we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump he's truly cares about other people he's extremely\nUh magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media you know they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times\nHelping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong ... Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection and the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nWhat are they only report the bad and miss administrator for the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history they'd conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump getting interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times\nHave their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they no longer in the business of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana framed it as mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh all along about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman\nRepublican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with tens\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose them there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence say antifa is so out of control your goal is higher is destruction it's not going to make our country better this president is created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally is acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw it on TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing ... in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the Congress if Donald Trump has done that with ...\nMedia would be saying oh yeah they would",
