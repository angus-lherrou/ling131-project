living together on your own independently yep and then one of you get sick and goes down the hall to the nursing home mhm\nIs that and you want to apply for Medicaid Mm right or you you know you've moved them out of that facility to ... facility next door that you can get on to medicate right we're going to last minute plan and even if you've done no advanced planning to save assets for the healthy spouse as I explained yeah\nWhat about that three hundred thousand dollars that's sitting in that continuing care retirement community that initial deposit to get in that's really your money and is it going to cause you are in eligibility for Medicaid purposes\nOr the answer would be no really rising way but it's nowhere to ... as long as the\nCommunity spouses living in that unit\nThat money is not available\nTo come out you can't take that money out of there the facility won't let you lead you while you're living there it only comes out when you leave the first or you leave and you're not coming back right then you could get the amount back less ten percent or some requirement that they pay for ... and stuff so\nThen that money would be be freed up so as long as a community sponsors living there I Would say it's not accountable asset but\nIf you're single and you leave their yeah you've got to get that back\nAnd you know what folks if you're in that kind of a continuing care retirement community and you want to get a copy of this information right on page six of Todd's guide that he has written for the month of October which is designing ... trust there's information right in their folks\nCall for your free copy not only is this information in here but all of the the information that must be included in your trust as well as those troublesome clauses that absolutely cannot be included in your trust\nCall right now for your free copy of Todd's designing your ear evoke about trust guide at eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine that's eight

the next paragraph I Want to talk about looks like it's from the results of a fair hearing just from February twenty teens and it's entitled the right to potential future income what is that about [noise]\nOh yeah this this is a very this is a very complicated one or to talk about and it it really deals with I like to put you on the spot that just it's not that we can explain that it's just that it becomes a very complicated one for for a radio\nOr it deals with a paragraph that talks about you know paying out money to like for a trustee who is serving as trustee oh a on there and and if you're going to continue to serve as trusting where if you're a now unable to serve as trustee right\nShould they be able to project forward\nThe ability say well look your life expectancy is ex even though you can serve here's the amount of money that you could have earned\nGoing forward you can't do that okay you can't\nProject forward and there's statutory regulations that prevent you from projecting forward you know get say look it's now an impossibility to serve as trustee because you are in the nursing home you created the trust and you're not competent anymore so it's just an impossibility and therefore you can't project forward\nThey try to project backwards but while you were serving they could say what what you have received yeah and this amount would be considered accountable somewhat it turns out to be a small amount of money at the end of the day anyway mhm\nDon't worry so much about the fact that maybe you did serve as trustee so you figure out what the amount is and you you would pay it out in a small\nAnd a lot of clients out there Todd they're concerned that their kids are going to be put out if they're serving as trustee there kids actually can be compensated as because they're serving as trustee correct\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely so that's what we normally do we have the kid service trust and they are entitled to get compensation folks don't get jump up and down about this one either I can tell you that most of them don't take it no right why would they take it number one it's just money that's coming out of one pocket going into another pocket they usually don't take it\nAnd real quickly before we stopped Todd for the for the show there's information in here about an issue with having clauses about the right to pay the donors estate taxes and kind of final costs and here so in Asia that are in\nThe right one right so you know I I don't want any paragraph in a trust that deals with the ability to pay debts ... of the ... or like there's one that this this one said oh we can pay all the debts of your last illness and\nAh you know funeral costs and stayed at minister ration cost while\nThe court came back and said in this particular case\nWell debts of your last illness you're alive that could be a nursing home cost right right and so if a nursing home cost has a debt that we're allowed to use principle to pay that debt than to me I see the clear connection of\nMoney in the trust principal in the trust being used to pay a nursing home 'cause that could be my last illness mhm which is in a nursing home right so we don't want powers and the trust that allow the payment of debts of the donor war\nPeriod and then our trust we actually as I said earlier we prohibit the trust from lending money\nTo the don't or absolutely not allowed\nAnd you know what folks taught is included sixteen of these problematic clauses that should not be included in your trust\nHow are you supposed to know what should and should not be there refer to Todd's guy he is our subject matter expert this is a comprehensive guy that shows you what must and what must not\nBe included in that area vocal trust so that when the states

even at the time when I said you can't not sit there and look at speeds and Thomas Say it's going to be a good team but\nThere were two years removed from saying we gotta seems set to go for ten years exactly and they just get rid of that and now it's officially blown up\nAnd now we're back to where do you go from here\nSo we're who ... who replaced with down the road who knows I of course was saying the same thing now we said two years ago about speed and Thomas but they were good friends and have a good friend since they were about twelve years old there will be a team for a long long time I don't think you'll see they will be the\nLongest tenure most matches a U.S team when it's all said I'd be shocked if they're not\nBut let's go to another team which should have been great kept good Johnson oh yeah and we had three bombers honesty and ... three true bombers the now let's get to them shall we say you know kept a and Johnson so that kind of mix and match those a little bit a fee now and kept did play what two matches together I think\nI'm pretty uh the the one one one one was raising rates on leave but yeah that was a nice little scene there but\nYou know so and then I saw this article online last week about how all the perks of the ... the team gets ... you know and you know all their clothes paid for that dresses for the wives slash girlfriends and all that cool stuff and ... there was a picture of\nA ... kept his girlfriend with pulling the Gretzky who's\nDJ's fiance right they're going to sell the in front of the Versailles where they had I think the Gallup before the event began drew and only bring this up because it's their their in their beautiful dress as you can see Phil Mickelson and a couple of other players in the background and their taxes but obviously there together taken a picture because theoretically they're close\nOr relatively close and DJ and kept are supposedly also very close\nTheir workout partners even though captain basically beat him twice and majors this year right but you got to give them kudos for that for if you're a good friend you give your friend kudos for beating you betcha but then to hear that there was to use the word you never hear in golf altercation ...\nTwice at the at the\nAt the end of the tournament gala where they literally\nPhysical altercation right supposedly a polling Gretzky was involved somehow kept his camp totally denied it and we have to admit that we are taping the show a little bit early so we're not up to date on the left up to the minute news that's come out here I Am for them to have any sort of off the ...\nAs of now you and I don't know what caused that and half the people are denying it but multiple sources that have happened and\nHow could two good friends who put put on a team together like what happened and and and and that just goes to show you that there is this your U.S team isn't quite as connected as people want to think it\nShould oh my God well that's definitely true and there's rumors adjusting Johnson was with another woman and dissolves and just do don't take my word for Google it and I think maybe there's some frustration from that boiled over there was room was Paulina Gretzky wasn't going to go to the Ryder Cup\nSo something's going on with that and who knows but I don't know what the deal is but to the larger point for us speaking golfing markup\nHere's another team that I was told by all the experts in powers that be that wow it is who's going to possibly be Brooks cover Justin Johnson in the ... team\nWell that wasn't so now we've gone we've destroyed speeds and read forever moving forward because of largely probably reads fall let's be honest as much as I Love 'em on the ... he really can be and probably is a jerk but we still had a team that because we like to think what the differences aside and go out and do what they do\nDustin Johnson Brooks ... as we said we're told that best friends and now they're fighting in the locker or whatever they're going to do so that seems scrapped or Mickelson I got to see last week telling me that he's ... what was the word he used was and what we've learned a lot was\nWe've ah I forget the word but he was along the lines of what we learned a lot last week and I will do move forward which he never reference to what he\nLearned the whole thing reeks of\nSuch from my standpoint and I know yours such a bitter disappointment for all of our task force and this was designed to be what what what I heard it from your friend Phil Mickelson\nYeah we want to know home soil but we're we're zeroing in on two years from now because you know we want we have to one of the road and it's worth pointing toward and [laughter]\nForget the final result this is what we get we get a fractured team that I thought I was going to watch for until I'm sixty\nWe got Brooks a captain Johnson funding in the locker room we have no structure no nothing Tiger Woods own for partying on just think about what I'm saying as I was told this was worth pointing towards [noise] I'll take a deep breath and turn it back to you\nKnow and again I'm bitter disappointment perfect phrase because I think that what ... started four years ago was that\nThere was a a fractured process and we all joked about the really the task force and all this it did work in ... wedding solve a lot of problems of course simply put\nUh I Do still think that I don't want them to break things apart I mean they're doing what the Europeans do on a captain ... ... and Jack johnson he had Tiger Woods is a potential vice captain until they made the team ...\nInteresting enough of our will will will will well here's a question I just thought of like will guys like Phil wanted the advice captain at some point a legal right from player to captain and you know question you know for six years life uh but I don't think they have to blow up the process you know I guess I hold on a little bit of hope that\nYou know if tigers ...\n... can sustain this excellence you could be on the team in two years I'm pretty sure feels done some guys like bubble are probably not going to see again the next team who knows what's happening with the J but I've got a young core group of read a ...\nThomas all this you know really those three guys I think of to form a good core yeah um you're going to but they liked the way fewer captain they'd like to input I think guys like ... and Johnson who could be future captains maybe might follow the same route so I don't want them to push the panic but I Want them to go back and saying\n'cause what ultimately failed miserably was not only their play but just their their their ability to bond together yes but the process of trying to feel the good team of talent as they're always been a ... the Europeans just do things so so so much better they do\nAnd then you find out to find out the guys were talking about last week that fleet with them all in our area which is the most successful team they had were great friends and you had no idea to show that [noise] that that old standby the Europeans are much more of a [noise]\nA cohesive team still exists only though we are at a time and we have one more segment to go so stay with me on the right thing\n[noise] Hi this is David from Penn Brian [noise]\nBack to talking golf sponsored by corona ... lower ... calories higher expectations\nDelayed for you've been waiting for has arrived and we've arrived here it\nBack to segment two of our show um I just sound like Ira Glass from this American Life and you're listening to the podcast he always says for act to an repeats himself [laughter] ah anyway sorry for that strange tangent there everybody but\nLet's go to our most disappointing perform at the Ryder Cup Tiger Woods um yeah and what you said last week was that um he was coming off such an emotional when at the\nTorch championship but I Want to give you some districts are the torch average up in a really cool anecdote I just recently read about that he won it drew a I don't know what these numbers mean five point to one overnight rating which is meeting than the NBC that was the highest\nRating of any non major championship this year and up a whopping two hundred and six percent over last year's event when the industry awfully one and and and Justice Thomas claimed the fed ex cop right yes I'm obviously\nEveryone forget that Justin Rose actually when the fed ex cop hung on biased fingertips yup it was actually a very exciting I even higher so ah basically the ratings that peaked in this like five six o'clock window a according to NBC the only two\nTournaments that had a higher rating and all over the entire year with the PGA Championship and the masters right and so it just basically it's likely to be the most watched that exculpatory event since the whole FedEx Cup\nSeries began yeah but tiger is still shocks and he's still move the needle\nHit was like no other and that's for sure and that was a it was a day I was actually closing the shop there was a bunch of people that were glued to the TV especially when there was a time frame of that tore championship when\nNot only was clearly going to win Ninety percent chance but he also the chance to win the whole facts kept the whole thing by which some people might forget that of Justin Rosenberg last hole which has granted it was kind of a nondescript hit a great drive great second shot on the green to part of a Bernie but if he didn't make Bertie\nTiger Woods when the torch championship and the facts cup\nWhich would've blown people away my so ah but yeah the people all like that was that there was a tournament out there that day and those people coming in all the time how's he doing how's he doing [noise]\nThe bottom line is love him or hate them or however you want to feel about them or when he's in contention and I think I Am hoping for my\nMoving forward he definitely deserve that he really did you ... how you know I feel as a matter of fact I've said many times to you and I still think this way he deserves another major um so for him it was unbelievable when we talked about it many times over the last couple of weeks\nAnd you got to believe if you can get his body and mind and so forth ready to go which he he's very clearly good at the end and individual golf tournaments he's going to be front and center with a master's next year and there's no way around this way I", "show_name": "Talking Golf", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "14"}
