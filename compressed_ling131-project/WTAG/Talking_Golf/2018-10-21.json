{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Um okay well she gets the kids on board yeah yeah it's OK model so we have no trouble and they agree to give back the money\nThat they get so that ma can buy another house mhm 'cause remember folks when you have a life of state and you get older the value of your life interest while you are the president owner of the property the value of your life interest is small the older you get\nSo at her age and and I forget how old she was she was about ... pushing eighty\n... the amount of procedure she would have gotten would have been maybe Fifteen Percent well that's not enough to buy another house no on five or six hundred thousand dollars so\nThey sell the house and then lo and behold unbeknownst to her son decides to say you know what I'm not giving it back to money wow well she doesn't have to right that's a big problem\nAnd so this is why I don't want you to ever give the house to the children and ask for that permission and so then a little bit longer goes on and she says well listen I Can't have this um a aggravated I'm going to file a lawsuit against my children oh my goodness oh yeah so she does\nAnd you know what folks before we go any further let this be\nDo you don't let this be your real life story gets your planning done get it done in advance if you've been wondering how these ... trust operate if you're concerned about protecting those assets\nTodd's guide that he has written for the month of October it's designing in income only very vocal trust it gives you the guidelines of what needs to be in your trust what must not be in your trust\nPage eleven shows how you can sell your home after it's in this trust without asking the permission of your children page fourteen shows how you can change your beneficiaries\nInstead of filing lawsuits she could've just change her beneficiaries at her well ... if she uses these trust call right now for your free copy of Todd's new guide eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine you can also download a copy on our website legal exchange\nShow dot com okay so now we've got the lawsuits filed suing yeah the the one that the three than out all three has got a ... attack I guess she's suing technically the child who won't get well then they won't give back the money\nUm and so you're right that was a great analysis Susan that you made whereas if it was in the trust not only would you not to even give permission to sell you not need to ask for permission to get the money back\nAnd you could change beneficiaries anytime you want your out none of these problems would have existed had done the vocal trust okay so she filed the lawsuit and\nThey're waiting now her argument is that she never really gave away the property and there was really some kind of a constructive trust that was formed I Love it\nAnd and so this is the arguments that she makes and the court proceedings go on and she dies\nYeah before the answer so she dies before the answers so that's why the kids the two daughters are in the meeting with me she dies before the answer then the answer comes and guess what she won\nYeah so the money was forced to come out of the escrow account and the judge ordered the return of the money and so now the money did get\nPut back into her account because it was as if she didn't give it away and so all the other money all the proceeds now is back in her state ...\nSounds like a win because she really didn't obviously she well she was going through the the the the law suits you changed your will and made sure she just inherited that yet son so she really didn't want to son to get even one third of the proceeds\nSuccessful you think but\nSo it turns out also that she never went to the nursing home so there was no worry about Medicaid leans from the nursing home except she was on the community mass health for a very very long time to the tune of about two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars a long time\nSo during her life community mass held had paid and now there's a lean on her state for the two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars of mass health claims that she fought so hard\nTo have this asset put back in her name because she died in ... and her name yeah most you finally get all about the argument was so now with her name yeah and so because it's in her name now there's a lean on the property and they're wondering can I\nDo anything now yeah I don't think so\nRight 'cause it's cash you won't even be able to negotiate a settlement because that's all they're right and they're going to say just take it and this is where as state recovery comes in and take the money\nWhereas had they left it the way it was with this life a state arrangement at least worst case scenario the son would've got one third\nOf the proceeds the two daughters would have gotten their one third each\nAt least and that would have been no probate assets so there would have been no as state recovery and so mass health would not have been paid you cannot even make this I'm telling you this is one of the top ten\nYou must have been salivating in that way\nTo use this real life story I mean I feel bad for the people that's not the point and I explained to them I'm going to do this just to help other people not necessarily give away the property and reserve life a state\nThis is a real life situation right don't do that if you really want to reserve life estate 'cause you like that feeling then put the remainder interest in one of these irrevocably trust and move forward ... and that way you won't have any of\nThese problems you know what folks don't be Todd's next real life story educate yourself get your plan in place you need to have an iron clad uh stay planned and this guy will show you what must be in your trust in sixteen\nDifferent trust provisions that absolutely must not\nBe in your trust it will also show you how these operate on a day to day basis because when you hear the word ... it is not as scary as it seems you still have the flexibility\nTo sell your home to change how

don't have to think this way maybe you do to a certain extent as a problem but professionals have to take into consideration there adrenaline 'cause they're always in your on how you betcha so there's times where you know they they get to seven but they're going to aid because they know their jacked up I don't have to worry about that I'm not that good but uh\nAnyway so hazing or said my advice to everybody including tiger would be control your distant right he's like if I Know my back then he price in my experience\nGoing one fifty five now you know now Justice Thomas might say made on goes one Seventy five [noise]\nHe says if I Know what's going one fifty father all I have to worry about is the mist right or left and for the most part if I write if I\nPlay if I play properly my thirty my my twenty yard Mr the Wright is still on the green or an easy chip provide as insurance on himself historically has advice which I remember the day is work\nOn your distance control and obviously tiger figured that out on the ... pretty quickly it helps pay dividends for the past Fifteen Years yeah and\nYou know what that that can be a lesson for all of us I mean in the desert and the you touched on the whole controlling the distances and how that relates to all of us is this different ways of doing it I mean you hear just the oversimplified version is if you're in between clubs\nYou know some guys like to hit the if you're in between seven and eight for ... for argument's sake\nOr some people like to hit the easy seven some people like to hit the heart eight and but how that listen to our discussion is you have to find out\nIn your own temple your own game you know mentality what ah is the ... more consistent of the two when you're in between that's a big part of control and just you know what I mean and I think people get lost and other stuff but\nI Know me I'm always sending the hard part with him in between make it the making a full swing and go after it as opposed to back down but that doesn't work for everybody a lot of people tell me they prefer to choke down in swing an easy one because they feel like they're going to be more consistent with a solid contact and be closer to just as they want to have\nNow considering I Am is far from a instructional pro as possible I'm going to provide some instruction advice myself yeah I Do agree with you on that a with a ... is that I think that when you're a good player like yourself\nAnd you know you know you're pretty consistent sort of a unique the hard swing seems to make sense to me because you can go out at heart and you're you're you're confident that swing I'm\nI've taken some advice from Scott Hickey our director uh golf many times who says how many times amateurs or over the green unless you really ... when you never are very low most damages like myself should take the extra club but what I've done is I've sort of combine the two advice that I take the extra club now because I'm really not good any more\nUm but I choked on a tiny bit so that I feel confident I Can't think of hearts with her because of the most common mistake icy amongst my friends that I play with is they take the extra club but then don't commit to make this well that was the problem so they do celebrate or they make a an awkward swing and so it's a\n... it depends but again this is to me what I find fascinating about golf is so many nuances to highest thing what you do with it curious reprogram and if you don't want it to be a cerebral grand me just take the shorter club it as hard as you can kind of the Dustin Johnson of ... yeah exactly yeah go on to the next one not or the\nUm I'm I'm halfway between the DJ approaching the fill approach where you kind of analyze things a little bit yeah ... uh anyway uh we got about a minute left in the segment let me sort of set you up for I Want to totally switch subjects year because\nWe're already like three tournaments into the two thousand Eighteen Nineteen season still not used to that you know we were we were discussing this morning so what country right now I think this weekend there in Korea they were in Malaysia last week um I think they're going to China for the world golf championship through the next week of the week after sounds right but\nI Do even though I admitted to you I think off the air that I had no interest in the Safeway Open which was the first term or the yes I'm a couple of interesting stories came one by Kevin twice Kevin twice so they go\nSo Kevin twice yeah Julius I'm not quite All right Kevin twice father Bob way I'm Bob Wei is most golfers remember\nUh one of the Nineteen eighty six PGA Championship defeating Greg Norman's a lovely he won eight times on tour it and we want to have many did you hear the good pretty good career yes I Would have gone that when it gets so Kevin to a Thirty Years' old\nFinished eighty seventh and fed extra points last season never even played in the PGA Championship that's a shock to me that his ... he was right to a hundred and thirty eight than the official will golf ranking before\nAnd during the day if we open and now he became a\nThe he won his first tour victory becoming the eighth father son duo making\nHim and his daddy father son do to win a [noise]\nA PGA Tour events and what that perfect time for a break we'll talk about those eight [noise]\nI welcome back to talking golf or\nAgain let me just say that we are sponsored by corona premier lower carbs or calories higher expectations of light but you've been waiting for has arrived and I would definitely appreciate it from the folks from growing up near to fight us that sponsorship and allowing us to continue to\nDo it well should we are so anyway we're back to Kevin and Bob the way the father son tournament so father son victor's on the PGA Tour and again they made the list of eight now and\nYou said during the break that you wouldn't mind given a shot to kind of guess a few 'cause I'm ... I'm already shaky of my first one to Gary Nicholas I think he wanted an event so I'm going to say Jack and guard was he actually did not\nBut I remember last and last in the playoffs enough that I mean I remember that ... maybe\nActually not you're better than me on that one but I remember him losing and like the playoff was like it was raining so yes and you get when I remember this for some reason I remember he had a bad one to the right and then the guy he played against knocked at stiff and you know guy Nicholas lost in the playoffs and you don't want a little boy\nAh you're gonna have to get started as a write it out I was gonna say Miller Barber and his son that's not\nRight you know so let me give you some that I I Would never have gotten either I think of this guy someone as a trick shot artist from like the thirties I could be totally wrong but it's Joe ... senior and junior no I don't know that at all a guy I'll give you one that I Would never guess in a million years but ah the father I think\nI don't even know which one one of them is a masters champion\nA bumblebee no from the fifties oh uh I don't know a Jackie Burke oh I should so this Jackie Brookes senior and junior and I'm embarrassed to admit I don't know which one of the year I was gonna say\nI I think ... junior when the ... I think you're right I don't feel one hundred percent sure they'll but if you want in the fifties we would river member that's golf fans yes that so his dad obviously must have one in in the ... well ... um Italy you said about um\n... goldie because here's the head\nHe might be the only uncle nephew who was his nephew [laughter] that is that I thought of it and then his nephews on this list a oh a\n... billion house yes as a U.S is that oh I should have just like Jay has married no I think Bob ... says uncle yes yes correct as one okay Jay ... I might have come up with that but so we had a job ... the ... the ... the ways we got um [noise]\nThe one that I didn't even know if you've ever heard of these guys I had heard of one of them but I couldn't have told your why Clinton Hefner and Vance hafner no votes Hefner yes yeah he's fairly read when did he deserve you have written for I don't I just don't know the last year early recent that want to say really nineties fence out rather than\nBetter than me so I actually uh the other one here is a a guy that we've seen play I think you might put in the senior tour now his father if I'm not mistaken is the oldest major championship winter uh Julius borrow yes yes and diversity on Sundays they one\nUm [noise] ah he hears either got two more and you'll be definitely disappointed not getting one of these uh one of them the father is Mr fifty nine oh al ...\nAnd we should have got that with Alan Brent breath and ah I always thought ... was a is like is\nIt really is he was his son ... or ... I'm assuming he has one when I think so [laughter] actually that's a very good his mind more than me so I mean I guess that most of these guys especially recently ... guy burger house no houses on a few times house that you want to fix it up to right and then the last one\nUm you'll definitely get they look exactly alike not the most um I don't have\nA very normal and I got it got Fisher dragging Kevin ... going to do with your factory mannerisms exactly I'd say walk of life that's pretty good one yeah event enhance and and what I Love about the first of all they do look exactly like it's fascinating\nAnd incorrect Sadler a the walrus the walrus no known for his moustache known for starting in my mind anyway the he was the victim of the very first and then you'll and violent and again I don't know if our listeners have heard about this sort of tell the story but to me it\nWas I think in the eighties right he has a just kind of showed the beginning no one I think even back then thought this would be as much of an issue as it has become I bet\nYou a lot of the sweeps guys up at separating keys will know what we're referring to if they're listening or I forget the tournament but I Do remember exactly what happened he put a towel down\nA to hit a shot he was under a tree put a towel down simply because really dry it it just because I don't want us to ask the pits to get dirty\nAnd you get the shot out and this is probably going to need your help I don't know if it was that day or the next day I think it was that I Know what are called in and he got penalize for building stamps and you're absolutely right he was the first one", "show_name": "Talking Golf", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "21"}
