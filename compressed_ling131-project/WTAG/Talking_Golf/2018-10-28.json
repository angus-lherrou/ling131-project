before you enter the nursing home [noise]\nNot a loophole for me then not a loophole but if he had set this up long ago was that the other point here I don't know how long ago he had set up day investment account ... it's very possible that if it wasn't within the five years that all of his money\nIs at risk even though he might have thought in his mind somehow half of it maybe was protected when in reality none of it is protected\nNow if he had changed the owner and the beneficiary on the life insurance policy to the child more than five years ago I think he would be okay with that uh it would be protected\nI don't love that idea but at least it would have been protected so that being said\nWhat's gonna happen when we go to apply for Medicaid 'cause she's going in to the nursing home\nAnd you know what what you're probably hearing here folks and realizing is wait a minute there's no benefit to given it to a person you don't short in that fire clock\nDo it to your ear evoke about trust Todd's guide for the month of November outlines everything you need to know about these trust how they operate the information that should be in them and then the information those troublesome clauses that absolutely cannot be included in your ear evoke ... trust if you want it to work when you needed to folks\nCoffee or free copyright now eight six six\nEight for eight five six

understanding of what he's done we go into the nursing home we apply okay as you were saying Susan from uh I'm going to compare estate recovery versus trust planning mhm right so if this was all put in a trust the bank accounts the investment accounts the home you know all in the trust\nWell then you see the ah\n[noise] ah there would be ... there were ... and we're beyond five years there would be no state recovery here right yes that's would be protected not half mhm all and know a state recovery won the individual dies\nYou just die and whatever's left in the trust is there the life insurance on the other hand I could not have probably put that into the euro vocal trust because if I did change the owner and beneficial to the trust\nIf it's still required premium payments than the father could not pay the premiums because then he'd be paying a premium on a policy he doesn't own therefore\nAt five o'clock would start every time he makes the policy payment\nBut if he had put assets are bank accounts into the trust then you could pay the premiums would that trust money right\nThen he could as long as there's enough money in the trust to pay those funny I mean okay very good point Susan you could actually do that\nVersus what he did he gave it to the sun changed the owner and the beneficial to the sun I said yes after five years you would have protected downside who's going to pay the premiums when he went to bat the dad still paying those premiums are going to have the same problem with dads or another short cut problem that doesn't actually work\nAt the end of the day mhm so\nYou know at this case I'm thinking the ear Reza ... trust would have not had any of these issues\nSo now what happens now in his case we're going to apply for Medicaid\nAnd they're going to say the houses non ...\nI like it yeah it you've got you know none of the bad things happened by owning it dodging alone in a life a state with a child I get it but\nAt least it's protected from the nursing home and you know a state recovery let me explain he even though he owns a life a state interest in the property since it's his home\nIt's deemed non accountable while he is alive and when he dies the life of state expires like magic disappears\nAnd any lean that would have been on it also disappears and so it passes outside of probate to the child and he becomes the full owner\nOr in the simple so what that means is\nNo state recovery because at least in Massachusetts you need to check with your state\nBut some states have expanded a state recovery but in Massachusetts a state recovery is limited to assets that are in your own name on the date of death\nThe life estate avoids probate so therefore it doesn't own name means that goes to probe it hey okay so that's a good deal\nNow what about this joint investment accounts let's say we didn't do it more than five years ago and not even half of it is protected what are we going to do you can't leave it joint thinking that somehow that's going to avoid probate right because the whole assets accountable\nYou're right or two thousand dollars so thinking you're going to leave it join and get on Medicaid to avoid estate recovery is not going to help you because you won't get on Medicaid you and me and\n... because you have the money and you name regardless of how the ownership is if it's half and your name it's all ... yeah\nIt it's so in this case you're over two thousand dollars so you don't have to worry about a state recovery 'cause you're not going to get on Medicaid right\nSo that's not a good deal same thing with the bank accounts what are we going to do we're going to take the bank accounts and the investment accounts liquidate them and either buying annuity in his name on Medicaid annuity to convert it to an income stream allowing him to become eligible for Medicaid or\nPut it all into a pool trust depending on his age and how the numbers play out also avoiding the five year waiting period yes there'll be a pay back provision on both\nBut at least you'll beyond medicate ... and when I say a pay back provision that's really a state recovery right so instead of worrying about it going to probate because it's in a pool trust\nThe trust itself has the language that says we don't need to worry about probate it's going to say right in the document after you die pay back the state at least the amount of benefits you received from Medicaid\nTakes some advice folks avoid the last minute dance do your planning in advance do it right\nMake sure your trust is drafted

I think his name was you're right very good I wanted to come up with that but I Do remember that a good pet poor could get lots of his first marriage playing with bank graduate who has like say who shot a Brazilian and I think that was his last masters too by the way\nA Billy Payne also established helped establish because the the PGA and the any PJ locally uh uh do the drive to pinpoint championship is correct and when I went to him I didn't know that well he was the the three people involved with the the drive in part or the U.S I think the\nUs Jay the PGA and uh the masters as a matter of ... the finals of the graduate butter out the master up\nAnd I think the PGA through as local chapters like any PGA do humans work\nIn running that whereas we do yes are you guys have a great job and then of course\nOne of the things that I think this committee muster recognizes that under his watch pains watch the first female members were admitted to a guy yeah okay well you know that's a pretty stop a staunch resume more so than ever Menlo just respected\nMr paying a I Would have just thought that he uh just wouldn't have occurred to me that the role he plays would be all the material yes it obviously the sex can they felt differently and\nAnd ... [laughter] but I think of him I mean most of the uh are\nAre seeing the uh Augusta members in committee chairman and so forth\nYou really obviously only see a masters week and they have a really neat uh with with the exception of Mr ... he was actually very forthcoming when they interviewed him back in the mass or if you saw any of it or member any of it he was really good about it you talked about the women's uh women's amateur having we have rounded Augusta that's coming up next was\nSignificantly more forthcoming in his answers Billy Payne was like a mean bill ... meaning I'll never forget when they asked him about\nIt was a lady reported asked him about\n... will be really nice thing too because I guess at the idea of been bandied around them having a female event at Augusta\nAt the fast forward to now they have sort of have one but anyway\nThe question came to Billy Payne about well some some talked about maybe having a fall LBJ major weather and his answer was so ... it was like we haven't even thought about that next and he didn't even just completely missed the reporter but it wasn't just you know a women's event he was always answering in that way which made me laugh\nAnd I think by now just before we go out there for the section as a I think about four or five women members now still not much for them a few more he's in charge of that that's a good thing anyway so we'll be right back with more talking golf just after this short break [noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to talking golf sponsored by corona premier lower ... calories higher expectations the light bill you've been waiting for has arrived and outfits let's talk about the just the rest of the holiday and a duck these I think it's interesting a routine goose and I'll give you the stats and you're going to get taken him Nineteen\nA PG tour in European Tour events already three worldwide tournaments modern realize that more than I thought obviously a one two thousand and one and two dozen for U.S Open yelling or a\nAnd a six international teams in the president's cup and one thing that surprised me twice the European order of merit European to order mayor winter and I want to know too right yeah it was a solid\nPhenomenal career I I still put him in the category of a really should have one more\nBut I hate to say it like that to be thirty three wins\nBy the way I Gary Player was the one who made the call to tell them isn't that cool\nOh really and I didn't know that that is pretty cool I was going to unfold must have been pretty awesome for all of them know that got the call if you remember and sometimes it's easy to forget because there's so many good players now that we're\nAdvanced in age this was a lot of people go by but at the like ... I Would say a lot of people like a few is a select few say Fifteen or twenty at the height of his powers\nHe was awesome to watch and if you remember he was appearing in the last group in two thousand two with Tiger Woods at the bachelor's degree was to back in the last group\nHe had multiple chances to win that tournament he was paired in the last group with Jason Gore remember that the u._s. open that when he played Jason going for ten dollars for me it was still one of my favorite stories of all time two thousand five Michael Campbell one about ... ... when you look back at his in that timeframe arguably two thousand two thousand six in that area\nA he was always a factor of the prettiest one you'll ever see the\nTwo thousand for us over that he wanted Shawna Cox was if you go back and look at it the Sunday at the clock was the best ... I've ever witnessed ever in any tournament ever made everything looked at from fifty feet anywhere to get that trophy so his career is obviously a solver career\nBut yeah I I'm sitting here in the first thing I thought it was a he only won two majors it feel like he could've won five six but that's but you know to just be for me being hall of fame\nAnd again I don't think he's fifty yet I think you know he's not he's um he did it because maybe just turned but he's had some injuries the past\nI think that's probably what the whole than anything else he did have a lot of injuries so let's go to um so the two of the woman on this list I'll start with Jan Stevenson because I hate to say it but one of the things I'll do remember about her is that she was ... she too\nWhen they want to promote the LPGA you have a beautiful woman she was they had a picture of her is that a yes cover only by golf all that's right so we're always picture brings up a big debate about you know how to use a woman golf and that was in the seventies correct some evidence yeah so\nSo she ... she joined the LPGA she's Australian starting in Seventy four\nShe earned work in the year honors and she did or didn't mind being marketed because she was a very good looking she's already knew that um\nShe was six tissue and sixteen times on tore a twenty worldwide three majors are the two dollars Nineteen eighty one do Mario ... classic the eighty two LPGA championship in eighty three us women's open ... and they just want to give it according to what you said a\nSo Nancy Lopez called her whole life so she was quoted as saying I was crying when Nancy called me because I knew she was going to tell me I didn't make it again I didn't hear her when she said I made it because she started the conversation the same way two years ago she said I Know you work so hard pill DJ be didn't make it she started exactly the same way\nAnd then uh I started crying and then she said but this time you've been recognized and you made it and I have goose bumps I Can't sleep and so just nice to see that I'm very much I think that she should be proud of this award but I think that the LBJ so talented now that\nWell it's still gets to the north that yeah there's not they don't they're not selling sex anymore they're selling just super high quality gone no question about again phenomenal career she had\nThe up by about you know what I was going to say you talked about a little bit uh the people now have people like James Stevenson Nancy Lopez Betsy came to thank for\nVase of people like they sustained the popularity of the LPGA into which I think and I hope it's not just because I taught I Know you're a big fan of the PGA Tour so am I\nI think it has gained a lot of traction especially over the last five ten years it's becoming bigger for whatever reason you want to say but yeah circles back to that one great career for her she was one of the faces of the tour for a long period of time and she was out there forever as I Love who you know what I mean\nSo good for Iraq by all means a hundred percent I should have been in before that I didn't realize you get some good stuff to ...\nAnd I think that's a good point I think that one of the what what what happened in LPGA tours and it's not as popular in the states is I I kinda like it to be but it's done a great job of rebuilding itself and re branding itself and worldwide is going to very good especially over Korea where locavores without where where I mean there are so many fantastic a Korean golf\nWoman superstars and they're they're treated over there like world tiger rather than they are and it's crazy and the story for another time but uh yeah let's go to the other woman Peggy Kirk bell\nSo I always knew her as the matriarch as they say of pine needles watch and and and um ... that was what she did in that had\nA woman's opened in Ninety six hundred thousand seven [noise] and so I just knew of her as this woman who was very supportive of the game I think she might have been on the U.S Ga a committee at one point but I always thought of or is this someone who's very well to the game with these us opens but it turns out", "show_name": "Talking Golf", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "28"}
