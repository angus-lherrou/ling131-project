{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "So if they've done a will that leaves everything to their spouse siblings you are now going to own one third of this property with your a brother in law mhm\nSo be it you know that's what's going to happen or she might have just inherited her husband doubtful and it would have went to the kids mhm her kids okay\nNow I get that and maybe that's the way I Would probably want it\nI Would want to be able to control\nMy one third ownership interest in the property right if it were me\nI I Would want to be able to leave my one third to my family mhm and and so tenants in common if you're going to own it this way is the way to go why because if it's joint owners shift with the right of survivorship then when one sibling dies\nThat one third would automatically go to the other remaining siblings survival of the fittest and yeah and you would be just inherited your spouse if you're married and or your children which you probably don't want\nNo likely not in the first issue and you know ... maybe you want to make sure that your share is protected from those long term care expenses well that's where the Erie vocal trust is going to step in\nBut you gotta make sure that your your evoke about trust is drafted properly\nFortunately for all of you Todd has written a brand new guy that gives you the information you need to determine whether something has been drafted properly it's his brand new guide for the month of October it's designing an income only ... trust and it will really be a good starting point for all of

least not the rental the rental I Would immediately jumped to the idea of owning an El Al see\nRight maybe not the the vacation property but the rental property why because if it's a rental property in three siblings own and then somebody gets hurt on that property they are going to sue three people\nOh I didn't even think of that and all of their own personal assets they have families\nThen yeah you know they remember this isn't the siblings only asked that this is just one of them they might have their own home their own IRAs their own four O. one K. is their own investment accounts bank accounts yeah\nThat's a problem that's not a problem for the creditors that's a really deep pocket for the editor it is three deep pocket three deep pockets so putting it in an El Al see would be my first thought\nAnd each of you guys could be a one third shareholder of the El Al see that way the liability when the lawsuit comes for the tenant\nThey will sue the company and not you personally huge difference is that\nThe the three of them as shareholders what if they are concerned about protecting from long term care could their individual ... be one of those shareholders\nSo now moving past the El Al see discussions Susan let's say\nAgain where would the shares of the yellow sea go the shares of the yellow sea would go into this irrevocably Medicaid trust him from ... if that's\nIf that kind of planning right works for them right yeah I mean if you're self insured and you have enough other assets you know you may not be doing a medicate irrevocably trust\nBut you certainly would put those shares into a revolt couple family trust yes but let's let's assume you're right let's assume they they want to protect their assets not only from the creditor of the slip and fall tenet\nBut from the nursing home well then this Medicaid irrevocably trust comes into play and we put the shares in and they put all their other assets in ... into their own respective irrevocably trust so what does this do\nBack for the tenant and common idea it's still allows each family to control where their third of the property goes mhm not to the other siblings yeah well that's good it avoids probate also good\nIt's going to help them reduced their pro or their estate tax liability if any also good\nAnd most importantly it will get the clock running so that if one of them get sick and go in a nursing home it will protect the assets from the nursing home\nWhy that's so important and you don't think about it as much when you're doing just your family planning ... this actually impacts other families because if you don't do it the planning and one sibling goes into the nursing home\nThe other two siblings who are not in the nursing home yet\nThat asset that they own what the one third\nOwnership of the sibling who is in the nursing home is at risk for the nursing home they're going to now tell you\nSiblings that are are healthy by this out or lose it mhm now there's some sibling exceptions that can work here but in any event you have now jeopardized the other siblings ownership interest in the property and of course you've put at risk for your own\nUh children your own family as to losing it for him so yeah\nLots of issues when you own property like the\nTwo year planning folks don't just roll the dice and not only are you putting your assets at risk and your spouse's assets but you can be putting your siblings at risk as well\nCall right now Todd has written a guide for the month of October it's designing an income on the ... trust and it will be a great

I Believe again so it doesn't matter he was ... is increasing his record let me just say this the u._s. captains picks and this will end this segment [laughter]\nWhen two in ten which is the worst percentage of captains picks [noise]\nGets who won the two points out to the break okay we'll be right back\n[noise]\nWalking back to talking golf sponsored by corona from ... lower ... calories higher expectations the light beer you been waiting for has arrived and let's just say there was a couple of people who didn't quite arrive with their a game yeah in ah Paris and\nUh for\nCaptain sticks Tony ... who did win both of the points by chance is Beck's Bryson details oh yeah oh when three Phil Mickelson Owen to Tiger Woods oh and for right I I just\nIn but I Know I said I I Want your feedback let me just throw one more I audience as much as you know once I can only take when tiger was interviewed after I think his last why are you going to say but go ahead like he just kind of talk like this I've never seen him so\nWith our jak and he's like I'm so upset that I you know I didn't play well I forget what he said exactly but he was just now I heard that maybe it wasn't feeling with the beginning the weak but he just seems so exhausted\nAnd but\nI don't care how exhausted you are we talked with us in the way in the morning you know he won the championship they had to be a let down but he got to do better than\nO. and for and you know what you look at the record and you see on four and ... and I heard it all weekend but let's just for a minute go backwards\nOr and this is the middle of his major surge through this FedEx Cup playoffs this is just specific to tiger will get to a whole other list of stuff later on\nEach week with his getting closer to when the people that I talked to my friends and so forth and watch and pay attention to him in\nThe Ryder Cup team especially knew it was a bad thing this is going nuts I Swear to God I'm not talking about the week before all of this pressure he's putting on himself to keep going in the play offs to keep going to the ... can to keep the and then to win\nAnd do things for a second I don't recognize how awesome is that when I was and I don't take it a step further I said if he wins today the Davis ... towards him a trip\nThat will be the most emotional one of his life potentially like scoffed at for certain people have the right they're like well yeah well maybe\nBecause of where he was and what he's been through and then you have to go to the press and then they have to talk about for over and over by how big of a widow was and how exhausted he was in what he did for the month you seem 'em rambling but you get it get my point in the second reference scorn on the plane and party with his teammates\nWhich I'm sure they did I'd be remiss if I felt they should a party has when celebrate is when now they'll end in Paris now they have to go to the functionality after ... you get my point is no window for him just just him for now\nTo kind of reset unwind revel in his victory and get ready for what he wouldn't owe me and you is the biggest week of the Gulf season\nNow you know he doesn't think that anyway we've talked about his career for Twenty years he doesn't like the Ryder Cup as simple as that but for the have the all these factors come into play where you had the biggest one of his life arguably on Sunday the week before the cup\nAnd my long winded point is he wasn't himself if you saw him shipping and putting on Thursday he wasn't himself he's Tom on the golf course friday he looked tired just interested in the whole time\nAnd with good reason like you know me I Want to bash them left and right but he was just spent and then there was rumors of him Dustin Johnson another guy have in the stomach flu so\nEven putting that aside it was the worst possible Tiger Woods we were going to get under the circumstances that lead up to the Ryder Cup I Will shut my mouth turned back to you\nKnow I I think that you know this is going to affect his legacy a little bit uh I mean he's still one of the best golfer of all time of course you know you always see he missed two thousand eight ...\nHe missed a two thousand sixteen yes I think he missed you miss fourteen as well I think he missed fourteen and sixteen yes so he's not he's missed a couple of the ups and downs\nOr he's at he's played at seven Ryder cups and he's at twelve different partners in those Ryder cups it's enough six of those he's only played with one and only one of those objects to the one with and that's your boy\nChris Rock I was just going to say Chris ... who is who is knows had when he played with tiger you got to sit down in the next day right and maybe broke up a successful Perry ...
