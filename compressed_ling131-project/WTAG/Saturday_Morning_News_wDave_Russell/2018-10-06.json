have a pop up course in college or Danny did you know never had man I've heard of a pop ups used or\nThat was mom and pops you're talking about mom and pops where they had the uh probably do like like a ... like um like versus Metallica had like a pop UPS Store in the middle of New York city\nOh just popped up and sold a bunch of merchandise Amazon does that would be walking about no of\nCourse we're all of a sudden in the middle of the semester they say hey if you want to get one college credit you need to do this\nAnd uh and and they happen now I guess well I'm up in Portland Maine State University\nWhich is funded through tax dollars the college offered a one credit course to students\nWilling to travel to Washington DC to protest US Senator Susan Collins as she ... her decision on U.S Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh you had to get on a bus Wednesday night and just go\nFortunately\nThe president\nGlenn Cummings said the pop pop pop up course\nWas offered without the knowledge of the school's provost\nAnd that the school won't be offering credit or paying for a bus to of student protesters there was going to Washington um can I ask this question and that's why it's interesting a beneficial from the main Republican Party\nWants to know how it got to the point where it was going to be offered and until reporters started asking questions about it\nUm it was in the works in going to happen\nWho did it using a gentleman when do you think we'll get an answer to that question\nNot one that will ever be answered yeah do you need any more evidence to show that that\nColleges are places where they in doctrine eight people like re education camps into a liberal mentality State University was going to pay for that I Would have a problem even with a private university paying for that because other than I'm\nVery few\nUniversities and colleges take federal\nTax money through grants and loans\nImagine that\nWhen working at a growing business you would imagine I'm Pam who sell Fox News hours from now when ethics Supreme Court battle could be over Brett Kavanaugh appears poised to be confirmed this afternoon\nYou can catch a new episode of the daily died every Monday through friday and it's ready when you wake up\nOn the weekend edition we'll be bringing you some of the best stories from [noise]\nI think the top story of the week just because it affected everybody in the country equally\nWas this presidential alert that went out from the White House it was a similar to those amber alerts it was an emergency alert system just a test a notification that went to everybody's phones it was a tax notification and my producer Miranda joined me for this conversation\nYeah we get into everything in the history of these types of alerts we go back even to the fifties to cover what has been doing for the last almost a hundred years trying to figure out how to get everybody notified\nMy favorite one was a a thing about butters and pink balloons so it's a fun conversation about the history of these alerts\nWe started off by talking about what's the point of these alerts and the first place\nIt's designed to let the White House informed the country something of a grave public emergency terrorist attack or an invasion we don't know what kind maybe aliens\nWe've all heard these alerts before the difference with this one is that you can opt out of other alert system this when you put an opt out so everybody was getting at the country has a long strange history with these types of alert system they've been trying to get them going on since the fifties so Miranda tell us a little bit about FEMA's role in this and some of these early system\nYou put it best when we were speaking off air FEMA has kind of been this mysterious doomsday prep wing of the government which I didn't know about until all this research we had to do for this segment and since the dawn of the Cold War they've been trying to figure out the best way to reach the most amount of citizens and let them know have\nSomething terrible is about to happen and like you said it's been a long strange history the first one that they developed within the early fifties and at the time they called it ... which was a mixture of the words\nControl of electromagnetic radiation and what this would deal with upon activation\nOf this warning system all the radio stations across the country would either shut down or switch formats over to broadcasting from the same two channels and it would be a recorded message from a guy who was a TV personality at the time and best friends with President Eisenhower Arthur Godfrey and he was a trusted voice he wouldn't record this public\nService announcement and there are no copies of his audio by the way I Love that very mysterious into and basically just warning everybody to stay calm and that Americans will survive whatever the nuclear war is going to happen like\nKind of like what happens now with the emergency alert system just a voice comes on and says hey it's an emergency become et cetera et cetera but this one was just funny 'cause it was tied to TV personality Arthur Godfrey yeah so that was early on in the fifties and then another system that they had which I kind of thought was totally ineffective and I guess that's why they cancel it\nWas they were setting up this system of mothers and pink balloons what was that\nThey did it in a really small concentration because this was just a test this was never anything that was major Lee rolled out but in a small town of Charlotte, Michigan which happens to be near a civil defense agency headquarters at the time they set up with five hundred warning generators and with us they distributed to just over like a thousand\nDevices to everybody in the town and they were to plug this in to one of their electrical outlets and then when they did the test of the system basically all the outlets started buzzing yeah and you were to go I guess your back yard and release a pink balloon\nAnd that pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds that something crazy what's going on but there is no message attached\nTo it it's just been balloons that means mass hysteria would break out so they cancelled that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of Nixon there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system than ... device hand what this what is it something that you can plug into your TV they think about a fire stick in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody be watching the same program informing of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust what the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their ...\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to bust your phone whenever he wants to\nJust to clarify if not the president's sitting in his office and saying I'm going to say now this alert no ... there was a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's gonna be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how they use it and then obviously what the emergency as hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time zone in combat attack was half forgot about that there is a long strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda thank you out there and\nYou're listening to the daily diving weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we'll be right back with more\nThe Army National guard is committed to keeping the country safe and our community secure composed of hundreds of thousands of citizen soldiers from all walks of life\nThe guard is always ready to respond to local or national emergency we protect the homeland were always there when called upon and in every state in territory we stand guard for our community to learn more log on to the national guard dot\nCom bust my masters is on the national guard Massachusetts broadcast association at this station\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nCome back to the daily dive weekend edition next up is\nStory of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies\nIt takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story\nHe won the lottery hit it big one Ninety million dollars and then blew through all of it he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nI'm a Santa Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was this peachy crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nRemember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him to peachy crews are bad it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the banks to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the PTA cruiser bend it Jim Hayes\nSo Jim have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one Ninety million dollar and the California state lottery and then\nOver the course of the next decade sort of amazingly I managed\nTo lose it all and then after losing it all came\nPretty successful bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he was then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking with pen he's in prison now and writing letter so he kind of ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time but he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we hadn't gotten her pour his lawyers and told me you know I\n... going to be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story so why don't you send him a letter in prison and just stay up for it he had already pled guilty I think it was waiting for\nHis sentencing hearing at the point that I contacted him so he basically went before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been sentenced in case anything and the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nHey I Am fascinated by what I've read about you know I Want to know more can we talk can we can we kind of a pen pals and he brought me back and then I send them all that stuff like five or six questions just hoping he might get back to me and he brought me back\nTo this lake really amazingly like up ... letter with\nLike a really good sense of humor and like a lot lot of exclamation points just not what I expected it all like in terms of tone right so I was like oh man now I'm even more fascinated by it because you don't seem to\nBe found out about the fact that now you're doing you almost three years in federal prison it kind of has this happy\nGo lucky even now kind of attitude which\nAfter everything you've been through ... well let's start with some of the good stuff and so he won Nineteen million dollars in lottery I was actually Thirteen point seven million wants taxes were taken out a climate of its own\nRussian thrill and it worked and he started doing research to keep it going he obviously had a drug problem with that point he went from painkillers to heroin and he needed to be that habit and this is what he was doing and he had pretty good success he hit nine out of ten banks can\nOut of eleven but still he with honor roll and all of it you have to kind of remember this is on the heels of ... not long after he got hooked on pain pills a condo that he was managing completely burnt down and he lost all of his possession [noise] so it's kind of weird which from oh hey I\nHave so much good luck in my life\nYou know everything is going wrong and now I have\nI'm addicted to heroin and a cat had\nAccess to the money that I have to get that easily every year he's kind of feeling sorry\nFor him at this point and it's not hard for him to justify and in his brain thank victimless crime right that that yeah you're not hurting anyone he doesn't have a gun\nAnd he was never violent with anybody he never even had a gun he told people he did but he never had one so I mean I think that help later on sentencing\nThey called them the P. T. crews are banned it and I I live in the LA area so I remember this a couple of years ago when this was going on seeing it in the news and following his bank robbers have always fascinated me\nSo he bought that the tea cruiser with the money that he had been stealing and that was his getaway car how did they have the FBI actually catch him like when did things turn I Know one of the things was a huge mistake he hit the same bank twice\nOnce except play and then who is kicking himself for this now but then went back not too long later hit the same bag but I tell her recognize that wasn't there before\nSo he fled without any money at that point and the lead investigator who kind of starting to get on that point that All right he gets failed I Know it's going to hit again down\nAnd I know from that now that I haven't gone out that I have a pretty\nGood hunch that he located all along with fame thoroughfare because here and we're all thing that connects all the bank\nSo after that failed robbery and they set up a camera along a highway\nAnd basically we're just looking for that knowing that he was probably going to strike and knowing what his vehicle was set it up and then we'll\nGo in and evidently he hit again and I don't think it was not too much later into the timeline and it was definitely less than a month\nAnd then knowing that he hit again just think that up with Ryan line and when the bank had occurred and then went through the camera which they got a\nA help from a tip you know the bust at his house was very dramatic he was walking out of the garage and they pointed in with a are safe teams and clock pistols and got him in boom that he was arrested in or being sentenced to thirty three months in prison three years of supervised release after that we know when he would get out\nAnd he had to pay back the money in restitution his release date is February twenty third twenty twenty so he still has a little bit of time in there what does he been doing with his time there and what are his plans after he gets released\nMaking art and prison trying every letter that he sent me had like some sort of elaborate picture on it like one hadn't Garfield on that he was a cat and\nOh you have some of those on Twitter or something I mean some people get\nHe wants to publish a book at the end of this right\nHe's working on a on a book I Know that he's like playing softball and exercising and that is kind of like capitols ahead force air ... side funny like optimistic view of all that now we have satellite look I'm clean and sober now and yeah I Know like fourth day talk for\nThe better he even said himself that it helped him more so than the money ever did and that's why I mean I Love these stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest highest to being so desperate that you have to turn to bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it Natalie O'Neill contributor for the Daily Beast and freelance journalist thank you for joining us\n[noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media at daily got caught on Twitter daily diet to talk to us on Facebook\nLeave us a comment give us a rating and tell us a story that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts I'm Oscar mirrors and this is the daily died weekend edition [noise]\n\nThis is the daily dives weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week I don't have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] Nobel Prizes\nWere also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and touched Sudoku on Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs immuno therapy quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who were these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ...\nBoth of them of specialized in immunology studying the body's\nImmune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective are effective in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells ... along with cancer cells will so that causes that causes all sorts of complications joined back about Fifteen Twenty years\nThere was another ... advance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in cancer cells now this immune based approach that sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time these two scientists working separately but in parallel\nDiscovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs to target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells as T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nI mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune\nSystem as sort of its own natural check points or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack the healthy parts of the body cancer cells of basically figure it out how to explain to them so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break about his immune system\nIn a way that helps him escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both sides of the sexually pick the breaks off with the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he used to be true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taken the true to an yes with TV commercials now are promoting the use of the vote and true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drugs has a show\nIt's just so happens to position the ant directly over the colonies trails which of course increase the chances that it's going to in fact more ... and so when the fungus growing through the muscles this wouldn't make sense right if it's kind of destroying these muscles how's it been ordering the ant\nOut of the colony and this is really pull him in our research but what they're thinking is that it is actually acting as a kind of\nSystem of itself so it's actually replacing the nervous system\nOf the ... so it might be releasing narrow transmitters that mimic those of the ... owned by to actually manipulate individual muscles so it's like a puppet master\nPulling strings and it's just it's daunting how this could have and fall but it probably happened small that by small that it started more simple than that of course but these extra manipulations help the fungus probably get it how to get into more and and that's what led to the developed with is extremely common\nPlay manipulation but nevertheless is happening I can guarantee you that that's happening it's real life you know it's happening out there in nature\nNow it's kinda crazy it takes about three weeks for the fungus to grow with inside the end\nAnd you talk about how I mean it's so crazy how delicate this procedure is because you know aunts live in this colony when they noticed something is amiss and another and sicker stumbling are acting weird\nAnother ... will literally come and take it pick it up and throw it down to its death you know away from the colony protecting the colony so the fungus has to be very careful that it doesn't trigger something weird in the end that it it's going to trigger one of the other answer and suspected of being some type of intruder\nSo how does that work how does the funniest delicately move around this because at the very end as you said when it makes it go bike the leaf or the tree branches something that's the point that takes over the brain kind of but before that the end is still operating normally in within the colony\nYeah that that's a really cool thing about ... you know I I don't want them to the short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happened\nTo be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals before they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of that a path to the fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years in ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so that scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical aunt so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of missing out bad actors\nIn the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago and this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presumed that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get it found out and that would get it dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you are sick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive the host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms and the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it\nTo its doom up you know ten inches up a tree so you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem possible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex because the ant colony is itself extremely complex and able to sniff out the sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball\nTo avoid detection and really pull off this stunningly complex devious manipulation\nThat's how we get the zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process and infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus as a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colonies that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in South Carolina I think we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of all if that means it's gonna tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of elite but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a perch it's easier to get a purchase on the vein of a lead by biting into it so that actually happened here in the United states is as the\nFungus there's ordering the aunt to bite onto the flag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that stamp and that's just all the more power to to\nPurchase there and you know get a good grasp because in the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forests where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will\nOver winter just sitting there on the stem biding his time and then once the spring comes around it will then finally arrived out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin the day of the aunts and in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the many many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species the worms do it to crickets\nTheir war or to the cricket the jump into water which is not of course great for the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then made\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation\nRabies actually is a very well known\nParasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so the book is about the wide range of parasites the\nReally incredible range of parasites more than you would ever imagined that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique ways whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering\nStructures in the brain so called by the living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration hope is very strange kingdom species that are really ruining the days of their house\nJust reading about the ants in of itself is so interesting so thank you very much Matt Simon staff writer at wired author of plight of the living dead check out
