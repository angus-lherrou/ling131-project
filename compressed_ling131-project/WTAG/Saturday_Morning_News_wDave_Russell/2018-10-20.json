and I'm like I knew who Scott Brown was and I know is why she's very nice woman worked in Boston knees\nThis guy that I Know he's really got a chance you know we're all a little bit resigned to Martha Coakley becoming a senator but then the numbers just started to he worked his ass off in that green truck and the numbers started to show wow\nAnd then the Republican National committee started paying attention instead of ignoring Massachusetts and saying we're not going to win a Senate seat in Massachusetts all of a sudden it was\nHey we could win a Senate seat on the Massachusetts and then the money started pouring in that's the way you can do\nThat so that's how we'll be able to tell do but I mean the polling you may be but the real folks have to watch or the Republican National committee they start pouring money into Massachusetts that means okay there's a chance here they don't throw good money after bad\nAnd we'll see if there is a we'll see if there's a cabinet bump for him to also see if there's an Indian DNA bumper him you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space\nSaturday October twenty I was here today on the breed our radio and I\nCheck out our cat tire

that's just something pretty serious it's not like they\nWill probably they're just trying to question this takes that step further and where the body\nOne of these people that apparently went in had a bone saw that's why they think that he was dismembered and the president has made that Saudi Arabia one of our allies in that area the reports are that Jared Kushner is very close friends with the\nCrown prince also and you know they're trying to open up the area to business and things like that so I don't know if it would put a halt to it but it would really severely impact what's going on there\nAnd this was extraordinary and I'm I'm being told oh that like inside idea right if people are a bit frustrated with it because they're saying the Saudis have stayed with the United states through so many different things we cooperate with them on every level why should this one\nGuy this one incident it's got all all that and there's no indication that the ... to by any means and the relationship with I mean that's not even I don't think any administration would necessarily do that over and over this\nBut you have to remember it's not just any other opinion writer journalism and decided very prominent he knew people in many many people in the U. S. foreign policy community he broke for a very powerful newspaper and also you know frankly like when it comes down to it often when you have a single face\nOr single name that often captures the imagination of the public for more than when you say a thousand people were killed today in this war you know [laughter] so it becomes very emotional issue I Know members of Congress are very very upset about this on both sides I mean they're really mad about\nThis and we're still waiting for any type of evidence are saying that turkey might have a lot of evidence but they're not sharing any of it just yet and the elderly works\nOr not the most reliable married ... either they have to do everything that\nA lot of people are making something out of ... apple watch saying that he set it up to record and it went back to the cloud into his iPhone which is fiance had and there might be some type of recording of what that interrogation sounded like\nYeah but the other theory on that is that turkey want that story out there because they don't want to admit that they have the Saudi conflict wired\n... foreign affairs correspondent for Politico thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me there has been\nA ton of development since that interview that we did with in the hall that kind of sets up with the whole story is about after that Turkish officials were leaking all sorts of stories to the media part of it was they said they had audio recordings of what happened inside the Saudi constantly\nThey said that Mr ... was dead within minutes and within two hours\nAll of the killers are gone there said there was a Fifteen person\nHit team that went in there Miranda tell us what some of these gruesome details were because\nIt plays like a spy movie all this secret shady stuff happening in these political constantly it's you know it it's crazy the secrecy that happens in there that they think that they can get away with this kind of stuff what are some of these details of how they say he died\nYeah and like you said there were Fifteen people waiting for him for hours to show up and they knew what they were going to do they have this all planned out from the beginning and like you said he was dead within minutes they separate his fingers and cut his head off\nAnd asked they cut off his head and dismembered his body there was a doctor a forensic who had been brought along so that he could assist with the deception and the disposal of some of the body parts and he had some advice for them including one was to listen to music as he put his own headphones on because that's what he like\nTo do to try to ease the tension when quote doing such work\nThey said that he was dead within minutes but how quick and fast the torture was you know I'm assuming well and what were those minutes laying right exactly I'm assuming some of those minutes were spent cutting fingers off I Want to cut off your head that's kind of messy and the end of it\nBut yeah for the doctor to want to be wearing these headphones and listening to music just to run a B craziness of what's going on in front of you is just ridiculous report\nThat the one of the ...\nIt's a Fifteen Percent assassin team world in there with the bones saw right that's going to make some a gross noises exactly don't want to hear\nThis is turning to just a mess on the diplomatic side\nThe United states is struggling with how to respond to this the world is crying out that Saudi Arabia and the crown prince is directly involved in this the Trump Administration wants to tread very lightly they are an ally we do a lot of business with them they buy a lot of weapons from us in the billions of dollars\nAnd the president doesn't want to endanger that President Trump spoke to reporters and acknowledge that it certainly looks as though he's dead now what else did the president saying how what\nElse is going on the administration in addition to his comments that quote certainly looks as though\nHer show jazz is dead he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis are found to have murdered him and before he spoke treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin pulled out of a major upcoming Saturday investment conference Mike Pompeo has been over there interviewing people trying to figure out what's gone on and\nHe even advised that the Saudis should be given a few more days to finish and make public they're credible investigation before the U.S decides how or if\nThey want to respond yeah give them a few more days to think about how they want to cover this I'm ... I mean there's still a lot of evidence now they're releasing video surveillance of these Fifteen person hitting walking in to the consulate walking out you know with the huge briefcase will get into some of those details in just a minute\nAnd we never saw ... walk you know and\nHe never walked out himself this investment conference that's happening there and a Steven Mnuchin pulling out there's all sorts of companies that have pulled out just saying we can't do business with you until we know what's happening nobody wants to do business with killers\nAnd this was a major blow to them because at this point with the crown prince coming into power very soon they're portraying him as a reformer he's very good friends with Jared Kushner he's trying to open up the country to a lot of new investment and this is just totally uh throwing a wrench into it\nThat people are saying look\nI Know the young kids level than\nThe other day a young kid what why came up right on or near the TV show than watch game of Thrones how last fall and they want us to and they're living on a screen we have two different strategies you had this cat and then the grounds of the world are trying to really when he won your phone\nAnd then that bigger companies like the a fiancee is that age you don't want to own you on your regular TV\nLet's talk about some of the big players on mobile then let's talk about some of the big players on all this subscription stuff Snapchat and Instagram YouTube obviously one of the biggest ones have been huge for years\nTo make a new player that launched yet but everyone talking about this one called ... which\nIs being launched found a bunch of Hollywood that\nKind of like a cat and then the other ones that are more streaming so get the types of things that can eat with like a Netflix are who they want to think that might get me and that kind of late next year it'll be family friendly and they want I think that's beginning to gain traction or that people are beginning to talk a lot about it is now and they're even had a snake Fox\nI was at stake because Disney five bucks\nAn hour and then that you already have that that'll be interesting to see how that one of the again really far behind like something like ... million subscribers now but I did twenty million\nNetflix came on the scene and they were doing a lot of movies and have now transitioned into all sorts of original programming TV shows and movies you're going to have choices all over the place and it's going to be tearing you away from the traditional TV cable bundle\nNo the other thing for an end or is that for really long there was never left it for a TV network at all in there and keep it to themselves they want I think they should be that\nFar and wide net and not because they figure well we didn't need them I think it's something that was ... their ... their content off of that is that right to know what is your favorite fat cells I no longer\nRight as a reason for that they want to make sure that the way that they can undermine their competition as like keeping their intellectual property he thinks are kind of ... that\nThat if you want to work you can only go to that and and you know while a lot of people think that content like game of Thrones and Breaking Bad it's like where I think we have family and get that little kid you really want that kind of pet\nSo I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of\nFamily and that and by that\nIs really interesting and but there will be no shortage of things to watch now so it's going to be crazy how it all shakes\nOut Sarah Fisher media reporter for Axios thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\n[noise]\n[noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media at daily diet of pot on Twitter and doing the guy puck Kass on Facebook\nBecause ... it was raining it tells a story that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts [noise]\nI'm Oscar mirrors and this is the daily dive we can [noise]\n[noise] do you love your college football\n\nThis was the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week\nAnd don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] I think one of the sources captured everybody's attention this week is that oh the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nA ... I think I call my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been in Samy wealthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the ... maybe that leftover generation\nThat's funny but I mean I thought you were to say something like hey no I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you should be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million a breeze for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and then I ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer first and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning a big I spoke to a uh Jason curling he's an attorney based in New York He's actually the silk acclaim lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners as ... eleventh\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically with protecting them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money and such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first of the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars\nStill a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also pretty large so people the the question that I'll get most frequently is\nI claimed my jak caught anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged us to file what's called the public record request and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nA director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game so we want people's names out there you know this is we want people to know\nWho's getting the money that they've spent on the state wide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow fee or an entity to claim the pride rent James carry his his name the director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess it may may be the only thing in that is that you could do ... your name coming out because the the trust with El Al she might get first building and there's there's only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skipped town if you can write when they're gonna announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media is you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news the media starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts is to close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but people that might want to start contacting you\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell come back to the daily died weekend edition here's the rest of our conversation with ... and I started off by asking him how the U.S is going to fare with beer prices\nAnd who are the countries that are going to be affected by this the most in Ireland like I said could see triple a prices of beer but the other countries in the where does the U.S fairness\nThe northern Europe is we get the biggest hit because they will have to report that most barley to make the beer and\nThe U.S consumption drops in price goes up but not as much as other places because barley production starts moving north into Canada further so we don't lose as much supply a barley is imported and exported widely and that was the corporate as a model but you know it really helps in terms of price to half a stuffed nearby\nWhat's been the reaction from other groups or you know beer trade groups I Know the brewers association was one of them that said hey you know it's just an academic exercise don't believe all the hype nothing to lose sleep over and then they also say you know the farmers would be adapting as things would happen to you know the shift\nBar the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields but so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nSummarize the beer industry is reaction pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this\nThing there was a drought and the Pacific northwest last year that affected volley production and so we're all aware of this and worrying about it and that's a nice thought some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that you know these are changes are going to be happening on continent wide scale and it is going to affect drops when you have drought and heat waves we can engineer\nFor things like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile of the barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can engineer for drought resistance but hate resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change leaves very basic chemical reactions that are going on on borrowing that make\nEarly barley and so that's why you have to move it or to farm it than you know you run out of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops so that people who study these things on ... agricultural economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people\nLike beer and the industry is pretty innovative want in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly the story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer as governor considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're missing when my beer and you know everybody's like interest in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween that I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week\nWas that every child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery there was this eerie discovery that they found it was the skeleton of a ten year old that had\nA rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child is way because they were afraid I was going to come back to life and continue to spread\nI spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university to Stanford\nWent on this dig in Italy and they found this child cemetery\nAnd so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic Roman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about it like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside was a limestone rock\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child\nDied of malaria sixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this kid let's say ... already dead they opened\nThe mouse forcefully shoved the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impression right locally or they're calling it the vampire of Luke nano it's in this like you said it's in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called London a crop believe they bend beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in this very well so you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in these trenches they're dirt coverage trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones Brahms called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that they were people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but that had violated society's rules and the name vampire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the day that thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were the rituals rentals you didn't say they were dumped honey suck all all over the place and these were just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these spirits would just pass along and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains were thrilled girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because it's Roman Empire section was considered to be assessed pull of diseases and they spread it through\nContaminated food and water and it was pretty swampy so there are a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nThis was not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire burials yeah in northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a brick in her mouth\nAlmost the same thing like the ... you know a shape rock but this was a British huge too that she was dubbed the vampire of Venice and England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone\nSo it just seemed like that was one of the populace methods are popular rituals to keep them from being able to come back from the\nDay but that guy in England it's fascinating because clearly in the year two hundred these people are talking to each other so somewhere these people in England new to do this exact same type of burial and the people in northern Italy or doing at the same time\nYeah it's interesting just what people will do when you fear or something you don't know how to control or react to it you go through these extra steps these rituals and label them which isn't vampires and things like that so\nIt's just pretty creepy that they would do that to a small child but when you're scared of something you're going to do those extra steps to protect yourself making random thank you ask her\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nAll right that's it for us this
