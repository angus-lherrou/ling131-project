twenty four hours this far exceeded that baseline definition of what we think we may\nAnd I say we meaning the climate community and\nAs somebody who covers the community at them in a way but really it's the scientists who are doing the work and they're saying to me we think we might be seeing a trend towards more frequent rather than an occasion that the real forecast challenge because if that's

science editor for Axios extreme weather expert thank you for joining us thank you for having me\n[laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOne of the other huge stories of the week was this surreal moment in the Trump Administration when rapper Kanye West went to the oval office he had a meeting with the president\nAnd in true ... fashion he just had this stream of consciousness rent it provided a lot of lives a lot of question marks nobody knew what he was going for sometimes Miranda you're a big fan of ... yes what did you think of it\nI have not yet and brought myself to watch the full video right because I still want to continue being a fan of you know he's made it very challenging because I don't often agree with President Trump he talked about the hat and\nHow was this Superman Cape for him we actually have a little portion of that let's play ... at the oval office uh\nI think if the Waverly\nThat helps you to de Paul\nLight you know they try to scare me to not where this had my own friends but his hat it gives me it gives me the power in a way it was something put\nOff it made me feel like Superman made from it was hot and humid for ... for me also got a list of you to American guy nonpolitical\nNo we're going to be on it how we want to do it by the way and just go and get\nThe president just smiling politely at the end he said hey you know what that was very impressive\nAnd you know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost he feels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia new species a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when ... was there with the president to we spoke to her about her impressions of that\nAnd then she was also part of a bigger story that happened early in the week\nShe had a private press conference with the president Mike Pence Mike Pompeo chief of staff John Kelly and that also was another surreal moment it was the closest thing you'd ever get to being a fly on the wall so when we come back from the break we'll get into that full interview with Olivia new to this is the daily dive weekend edition [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] station will come back to the daily died weekend edition but jumping tore interview with Olivia Newt see she's Washington correspondent for New York magazine we're talking about her interview with President Trump but we started off with the whole ... story and asking why he was there in the first place\n[laughter] little\nOstensibly he was there to talk about criminal justice reform remember his life can ... including the president back in the early ... to commute the sentence for a woman who had\nBeen in prison since like Nineteen Ninety six on a drug charge\nAnd the president did that and I uh he got a lot of positive press for that kind of one of these rare non controversial\nGood things that he did and I think that he ... to ... and ... and that's probably cynically part of why he want to continue killing this sort of thing and his son in law Jared Kushner who's the top White House advisor that's made criminal justice reform wanted his\nCentral issues and so\nIt gets reported earlier this week that ... that should be coming in to speak to the president and that was like main topics that they were supposed to be covering but of course Congress has been out\nThere very controversial early very openly supporting Donald Trump over the last month and both recently on ask now wearing a make America great again hat wearing it everywhere and he was wearing it today and it it's really funny\nIn the oval office I just kept thinking\nThis is so unusual because a Donald Trump is not the most puzzling figure sitting here in the oval office today he went out the most talkative person in the oval office if it's sort of a monologue from Kanye West he was also not the one marrying the make America great again hat so it's very weird\nIt was so interesting watching the video because the president sitting behind a desk and he has his hands class and he's just looking at ... go off president was just like quietly nodding his head like you said\nShe wasn't very strange and yeah you have them all out lenders character in their ... just went off and it was very much like the ... of passwords stream of consciousness and he's just going on and and he\nSort of out Trump yeah and the president speaks that way too though where he speaks in the stream of consciousness he touches on all different topics I mean I had as you mentioned before first hand experience it said earlier this week we have a lot of it\nBut I had a better view of the president where I'm standing in the oval and I get a ... but I I could see them both and it was just so interesting to watch\nFeed them hugging and Maya\nWang and they were like they basically I think John Kelly said this is my friends to Nick Ayres said and he's mind\nI Would never imagined General John Kelly hugging another guy like that or you know making the display hey we're buddies you know that's the comment I mean\nIt was just so theatrical and strange but I it was so awkward and any time I think you have an outsider like a reporter in the ... it's probably you know the performance but in this case it really really felt like a performance\nAnd everybody had been ... now and\nEveryone would still be differential to the president which I suppose you could expect that any president but the way that it works with Trump is probably get for it I mean he asked John Kelly he said what do you think the president and and the third person and John Kelly said he'd like\nVery great or something like that you know as if he wasn't just speaking to the president right it was just weird the whole thing that we're\nIn the in the last question I have already 'cause we spoke about Kanye and kind of the stream of consciousness thing and just kind of how he's all over the place the president in speeches and everything I meet at rallies he displays some of those same type of things\nSo how is it sitting in the room trying to ask them questions and him just interrupting jumping all over the place how do you wrap your head around that\nIn real time I didn't find it to be difficult but when I was confronted with how to like Monday that Q A reader\nI just thought it would almost be a misrepresentation\nTo try to contend any of his clothes and make them easier to digest are more focused because that's just how he talks he did not speak in a clear and concise way and I think ... if he ever taken out of context\nAnd I don't mean that at like an insult your reporter is the way that people say in a contract that anytime the quotes are chopped up so that they can be clearer I think it\nKind of an accurate in a way and I thought it was very interesting I was on CNN last night and a Republican operative who was on with me on the air she said that she had a bit at dinner earlier that night and somebody who was in my teeth but she wouldn't say who but it's a small group of people she bumped into him at dinner and he said that the White House with\nReally cleats it might be and they really liked it and it kind of it's very fair and quote the opposite of fake news\nYou know and I love to do anything because\nIt it's not the night that he's in the world but\nI think that Trump is probably satisfied\nTo see his quotations printed in full I think he would the times that he feels depressed as being unfair is probably a lot of the time when it's cold it's chopped up and try people try to interpret what he's saying rather than just\nPutting it out there and so I'm sure people are going to give me some shit about preaching a full transcript basically of what he said but I think that's\nJust the only way to really understand what he was saying\nI agree with you completely the article is great it's the closest thing to being a fly on the wall in the room thing to do just kind of see what's going on you know and\nAnd as you say it's time to ... might have seen like a production or whatever but\nYou know that's the way it seems like it goes in there and I love the way you wrote it out ... as it happened chronologically as you said the times the interrupted you it was just amazing so a great job on that piece and\nYou know it's just great but you were able to be there for these two big moments or just this week uh Olivia new chief Washington correspondent for New York magazine thank you very much for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nDon't forget to join us on social media really dive followed\nOn Twitter and in the White House on the comic give us a rating and

brother [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis was the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors running down some of the top stories of the week because of the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nThe most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing the old uh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space X\nBoeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubled Russian space program it's the only link that gets us up to the international space station\nSo for more on this we turn to rot pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff that pile books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when us as not one cause not go up the space station and they're in the Soyuz spacecraft which also writes up on a rocket I'm the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station gr we're gonna come back now the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's\nTheir get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official seal of approval on that for coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew\nOr not that is true I didn't\nSo apparently what happened is that it made it through about two minutes of flight and staging first said second stage and what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have drugs they drink but it's been a long time since I've looked at the pills or there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either an engine built to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the\nFirst stage to drop free properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nThe rockets designed to be able to do that and they all have been since the early space age book on our side and the ... the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have an aboard auction until much later than when you abort your ground control punches a big red button and\nA capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely powerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete writes a face\nThey said they were forced to do a lipstick reentry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that stuff that that that have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of a what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot\nAnd even at a normal ... year to look at it maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so ballistic ridge remains ... this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nVostok on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in ...\nGlides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle and away the shield is as items such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways much heat shield so it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to five sometimes six cheese\nA ballistic originally just means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet and because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine jeeze which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission what are riding with a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten afternoon huh and they showed some video the fed and at the point that whatever happened happened that started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you could see these two guys in our hands are flapping around like they're trying to learn how to fly over and it's really it's almost comical but realize that\nIt was a tough ride because normally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even before they hit the panic buttons cut out\nNo other way now these are Russian Soyuz spacecraft generally they're pretty reliable as when I said I Know they had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening because SpaceX has a capsule getting ready Boeing has another one also what do we know about these\nSo ... has been flying since Nineteen sixty seven it's flown a hundred and forty five times so although that's actually not that many more than the shuttle it's been very successful they only had two crew losses back in the sixties and then after that it's had a few issues but generally it's been extremely reliable and it's been around long times\nOf for profit skilled nursing homes around the country and if you non profit to agreed that the payment system needs to be restructured but they did push back against the study methodologies saying that it was to narrow the population to be generalized them all but the author of this study strongly disagreed with that claim\nAnd then if you have a family member that might be in a nursing home or something or you might suspect that some of this stuff is going on or they're getting too many treatments things like that what can you do to get a little more involved\nWhen I can say that that was published I received email responses with love wines concern for their family members care and also reporting instances where they feel that their family has made some kind of trauma related to this issue\nIs kind of an unknown you know a family members they're being treated and you trust the people there so you don't know what's going on especially you know if you're not checking in every moment that you have so there's a level of trust there and reports like this come out and it gives you cause for concern\nMany experts that I spoke to from ... in the nursing industry and also with an advocacy group have said that there's a great lack of information surrounding the payment processing and the treatment that these patients okay\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week we've all heard stories about passengers flying with uh the cats and their dogs in some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses if people flying with their emotional support animals\nAnd you'll deliver is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a duck wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen that deprecating pigs unfortunately the latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrels or I'm Sorry her emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy to stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy\nOkay that could have been figured out she called in advance so he said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had\nTo call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in another itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can share this red a frontier airlines features a variety of animals on the tails of its plane\nYeah so they're saying is that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar same made a score of\nCourse they did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering everything that we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses there does again miniature horses seem to be a popular one and the question then becomes how do people get emotional support\nAnimals I feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better there's actually a protocol that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed\nYou have to actually go to a mental health professional\nRight and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental illness or met emotional disability you may have and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they'd be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support on cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo and they can be any age can be happy it can be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't gonna run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut listen at delta spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administered to them a flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people for those things because they're pretty\nEasy it's yes basically a doctor is now is what it was even Web sites where you can go on line to let it yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained do your friend's wedding\nThat's just a ... it's a tough thing because riding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's going to happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane it's already going to be a problem\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate and they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but if there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already opposite\nAnd it'll cause that anxiety more you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you did get anxious what would your emotional support animal will be and it can be a cat or a dog has got to be a little ... something a little more exotic\nOkay cause might go to as I'm going to bring my daughter that are ten years later I Would have brought my own dog as well but you can't do that this is something in the line of a peacocks and hamsters can I have an emotional support\nTurtle there you go that's a that's a good one they're quiet yeah kind of cute in com that is true that is my animal turtle\nI think my emotional support animal would be a slob [laughter] because they move again they're quiet they don't get into too much action but I think that's why I think that'd be cute and something fun to a good conversation started I thank you Miranda thanks after\n\nThat\nAll right that's it for us this weekend be sure to check out the daily diets every Monday through friday
