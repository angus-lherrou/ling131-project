small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very few details about the specific the the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lies explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays at these explicit\nThan are examining those and are going through the wiring and the battery is and the overall material that these are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros

references as he points\nBack at the end of the room and criticizing the media and the crowd goes wild did however at that rally\nCalls for the media to unite the country he also tweeted on a Thursday again blaming the media for that he said that very big part of the anger that we see in our society is caused by basically fake\nNews and that it's gotten so bad that it's beyond description so what we see here is something very standard of the president uh these days says that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that played in Pakistan in the mid term that works you will embrace that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his easiest targets which is the media\nYou know it's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes

reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] election\nSeason and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this year for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not ... it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at X. deals for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so used to be said robocalls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial media can dial more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls ... these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line into becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can since the ... of them an hour\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the rye problems like open sesame for us all to open up the right hospital or to on the on the left to send these tax and it's essentially building a a platform to do that at scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we all know that people can go and they can\nCall and they have political candidates often a common space with other people supporters so it's not entirely on like that in terms of being another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rape of like about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to the Ninety percent of text messages or read within five minutes and I mean I think that is in ... we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nSo much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging that any way to break through the voters is a big deal

little paying you tend to open it right away almost as you said within five minutes a lot of times we're kind of conditioned already to\nIgnore a robocall or ignore a call that comes in from a suspicious number or an email you kind of already can see by the headline or something that it's spam or something like that but with these text messages you're really unclear about what it is so you have to open it\nBroadly speaking the tax message inbox is a ... ad heavy spot for many\nPeople not everybody but I think generally speaking we say that the messaging after may really popular people and and they have not been monetize in the same way as opposed to Facebook or Twitter where people are now more used to ads in the feed and messaging will probably be ...\nYeah and since it's a a person to person thing I mean obviously they're kind of sending them and massing all but campaigns are hoping for that interaction maybe it is something you're interested in you text back and you say

[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition\nI'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week\nThat don't have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] for the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the\nCentral American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked tough on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think the one difference we have ears were now at the\nDoorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats dad for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know under us El Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there are so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away I guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't gonna be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just\nEnough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid that's been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in turn Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere and four hundred million so even before all this happened\nPresident Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't\nWant to do that on his own and these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give and Central American aid when the time comes\n\nThis has to be my favorite story of the week I'm a Southern California guy I grew up here and I love Disneyland I Love going there\nIt is one of the happiest places on the earth and we found this article on Wall Street Journal about the big secret the Disney World and Disneyland have\nThat it's a favorite spot for people to scatter the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tributes that you can have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ashes but it isn't and where would you have them spread it\nProbably Indiana Jones 'cause that's my favorite\nRight I Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything I worried they're going to sweep you let die and then I that's what happens actually so\nWe spoke to Eric Schwartz all he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes and they spread them out in different places\nDisneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to have it be their final resting place oh here's ... with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me too I thought that I'd ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense that someone want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for it or they say it's\nA habit clean up so if you are a worker who these what you suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a habit clean up and that means\nYou need to grab the hypo allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will come up in a vacuum and clean it up while everyone you know leaves the premises and\nGoes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's or in in the hotel bathroom\nInto a pill bottle that she could then smuggle past park security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a ... that that's gotten through security as well and then once they're inside if they want us to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the rights particularly dark so no one\nSees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass flinging them as she ran\nWild and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit there and I just saw the you know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn for a ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this\nAnd never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians the consensus that I arrived that was that it happened about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more frequently I heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the ... says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nIt was the pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride and also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share it with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nI Love the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know what the hunted mentioned ride is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know in the next time I'm going to be they're going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the U.S\nI heard so many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes if and spread all over these parks the haunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why the ... the hunted Manchin is so I mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hot mansion they described just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot\nAnd because it's very dark and there are a lot of places where you can sort of an conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating a cleaning it up\nThey'll close them rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've always seen rides closed for technical difficulties before it could be something mechanical but this is also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nIt has a process that will kick start on rights like the haunted mansions so stay around comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises do radio refer to clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then\nThey will head out fast passes to people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they say the right to shut down and you have to leave you got to give them something wrong with people are going to get upset so then the the vacuum in come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look in the like are there any\nAshes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these rights icon pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty ... possible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of this darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween Eric ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hunting mansion please call me so I can do a follow up it definitely was a great thank you\n[noise]\nThat's
