them uh told him they look real you said there was a port a potty there is nothing\nCan I usually go to the restroom now\nHe's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the law for you to operate a business and conduct business and not have restrooms so I don't know where I stand on\nI well first of all a I don't think there is a law but even if there is a law I it he can say to the public or you can say non employees you can't use our bathroom there's not you absolutely\nYou can do that found it absolutely nothing other than nothing a driver can do now how big a facility is is that you're a delivering to\nIt's a pretty substantial\nSo why would why wouldn't you call the uh the supervisor or the president of the company and go are

you want [noise] oh okay I don't worry about it that that part\nIs ... and that's usually the case is I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have and then if it's a liquidation just splits up the assets but cars are almost never\nEver put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there's alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nA day and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm your financial car well the second you drive off a lot

that's easy I just look at the statues were they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet ... you know ten cents a bag law mandatory bag payment whenever a search word you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then\nThey can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow yeah so bring the the answer you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you go to the story I don't know what I'm saying I always bring their own recycle bags\n\nOkay there's your answer or what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what does my lawyer charge a whenever I Need legal work to keep in mind or my expertise is\nIt's a limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise in mind is insanely limited to third party reproductive laws you know I I was one way or charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some business documents are six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summer seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars an hour\nSenior ... senior partners in a law firm you can

hundred thousand [noise]\nAnd they're telling me the only way I'm\nWhy don't you only get sixty three hundred\nBecause she took the money I guess\nOkay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was at a trust there wasn't a will it\nWill I have All right and ah she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he crafted her with the ... or ... you're the alright well I I don't know\nI it depends on what the okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name and their high and when the will does the wheels specifically talk about the bank account\n[noise] yeah I'm On the phone rang and I have to you know whatever it let in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but that one has ever left there and they ... and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise] you know what I was talking to you know again I I wasn't raised with them [noise] my brother's everything but my brother almost dies so he couldn't be in\nRegina I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy and how long ago did this happen Regina\nMy father down how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know he just died okay so the money how do you know the money has been taken\nBecause the bank told me that the accounting clothes she closed in February that when I got\nAnd how do you know it was over a hundred thousand dollars and that of candles\nMy brother shot before he almost died he was in a bus accident and so\nI thought well you it's going to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you your brother said he saw it and how did he see it\nWith my father wanted him to be in charge he took him around the\nWheel with will specifically says the money goes to you yeah All right well you try try talk to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars to get taken a contingency that one is a problem because if the money is\nOh go on a ... and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where his lawyer yet that wears away or get paid yeah so there has to me and she spent the money ah Regina what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe helped make if somebody said that you go to and file it they can make make myself um I didn't say the ...\nAn executive or I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your scores to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to attract trust in a state lawyer I go to the website to do that because there was a lot of pieces on this one for sure\nSunny hello sunny\nThough probably more in the ... the crowd at grad school there so that that ah you don't have\nThe LA itself okay with that I had an idea\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do help people who don't have any money\nOr it's a these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some practice but you're going to need that you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\nDay that uh that that's highly than John\nMcCain in Georgia you have to call a lawyer in Georgia we call the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay Colorado law yeah\nCall every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work sunny or are you are you bro are you broke\n[laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nA democratic ... than our my mom or a bill\nAnd on this lawyer is spreading or what was it was a it was a a lot of a combination is known for its out of them and then the audience I Want to see that I gave them they are they there for ...\nAnd I asked them what to do it if they took their ... and pay I pay for the deaths of that but the average\nGuy I Know this makes sense to you can you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public record yeah you're going to need a you're probably gonna need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called a law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right okay All right All right All right\nYou know good luck to you know it's er just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good uh those lawyers are or what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said handle I'm sure many at one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale\nUnderstood but my question is ... him agreeing to let us keep July and August do I even own but the background\nBecause it's verbal it has no force at all first of all he's had his first of all these are the same for me to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said\nOK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero\nAnd that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law\nAnd common law incidentally the law started not as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms\nOf common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from a it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nOr Stevie hello Stevie okay I get you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance or with Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government can say what I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty\nOn me sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't ... odd there was a penalty why would you give up your health insurance typically Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that Stevie\nOkay so it's really ... the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford to design of his mind not the habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either have an insurance plan or you pay a penalty questionable\nOkay simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah\nI'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would\nBe all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but they subsidize the penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm right now though it's legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there's nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a war that's introduced right now\nUh so this could take this one new chicken take\n... years but China may neighbor pass but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you on a tight with apart had a partnership with the people that are\nFor nine years we put out two years ago we had a recall it filed bankruptcy personal bankruptcy a few years before so I Would label it file on it but my partner file bankrupt and stuff but they still come back after\nA well what kind of ... first of all was talking about the business was in a in a wealthy or corporation\nForget that partnership\nA and yes they can come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to buy any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you can be found with any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nAnd it was it was right the right field back there's wet during

kind of neighborhood where you and that was so crazy\nTerrible Marino valley huh wow why\nIt got really bad after nine years so we get to shut it down but I was actually a pressure that folk like my partner filed on it that that would have taken care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy why wouldn't you do an El Al Sisi or a corporation\nOr low yeah new idea where\nShe said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say although I'm going to repeat it\nDorsey high Dorsey yes yes
