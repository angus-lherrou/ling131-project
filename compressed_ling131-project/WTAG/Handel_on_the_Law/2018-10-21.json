[noise]\n\n[noise] oh\nPhone calls this is handle on the law alright Laura hello Laura Hi yeah I've\nBeen I was employed two and a half years and I had exceptional work ethic and performance and my boss discriminated against me and my religion and political affiliation\nI how well first of all are your what is your religion [noise] Christian\nOkay and I'm assuming you're not a wild asked liberal is that fair to say hey I got it and you're not [laughter] yeah but I kept to myself okay so fanatic All right so a discrimination is ah how ah was shown to you\n[noise] um she made a comment in front of a couple of other she hates Christian\nOkay now ... that's all she did she say she hate Christian where you fired where you've demoted or were you held back from promotion or is it just she hates Christian\nHe lock men so I kind of transfer out I've heard of it and then a lemonade that my position [noise]\nWow yeah OK\nProtected by her by her good friend\nAh who is no doubt or the head of Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] or somewhat of that ilk huh yeah here's here's the problem\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on its face it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't\nSeem to be a a lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and\nUh your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot of a\nJust a tremendous amount of power for example\nI Know the company that had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean people know about this company and there was an issue a day\nAnd African American who was working there and I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and I had a literally and sent everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of races I Know we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision uh-huh see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nAt my performance for better than the three parents but together but that's what you say and that I have proof that\nBut he but even so as I say I division part is going to be horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't\nMean that she's going to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that the ... it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew\n[laughter] horrible huh you see I work on that a lot truly [laughter]\nAll right Laura that yeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was a dead bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof here is a you know what I Want to fire you today I'm your boss I just don't like any more boom you're gone with no rights\nSo\nUh it gets to be a problem to say the least alright Joe here you go Joel welcome Hey Joe\nHi I'm only Seventeen year old disabled I have some serious disability and I'm I'm having problems H oh what a shock [laughter]\nI Want to put a window in a bad one of the mass [noise]\nSo I called the management company Fifteen times they never called back when I got a chance to talk to you on hold and trying to get a supervisor the board of directors or one of the car to go to one of their meetings but and they put out flyers saying when the meeting with the but they never put out of the time\nSo I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night\nWhen it hit that quit the window when ...\n... they said the CDC in ours but rent we were having a window because of the zero up why so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty personal with yelling at me and I go back [laughter]\nUm so that's where I Am [noise]\nAll right and what are they are they finding you now or is it just is screaming at you\nKnow the funny maybe a hundred dollars a month or so of course makes something art\nAnd they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming\nThat demanding a window out or else they would keep finding\nThe right has anybody else in the building or put windows in in those locations\nNot\nAll right so this is new well I it's\nThey have the right to say no or a they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are an and getting here's your fine and uh we're going to keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for it\nUs but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer or to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here\nAre based on what you said you because you didn't know who you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they applauded the company but it's a superior court action\nOr ... you know at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nA that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out and just say I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant\n... it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have been dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn and views you as an instant is an innocent party here and you truly are then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a lot of snow there is\nNot going to go there is nothing to counter to nothing the counters to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation is not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to be a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every\nBond yes you do yes you do when the thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help with that on an avid attorney I could just be that might do that yourself\nYou write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of that yeah you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about\nThe fences and there are affirmative defense is but uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research I absolutely\nLorraine Hi Lorraine welcome to handle on law I fail yes\nI took my car on this noise in my car instead of fixing that they fix my breaks it when I took the car and drive okay\nSure you have a case and that you have to pay for\nAll right ah yeah yeah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're going to get a fact that they didn't fix a the noise or you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battery and you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\n\nBrian Hi Brian welcome\nWanted to ask you for your whenever I see my dentist he's trying to ah talk me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh\nWe've been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a piece of cake three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do a cursory thirty five hundred dollars and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down the\nTo write two teeth on Ah yes I have one that I've\nBeen in structured and calling for three and a half we thought it was settled down it didn't I've been on I'd be proven it hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now sent me to an end though Don this\nYesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canal grounded to them too much or the hope\nIs almost to the store or that's lovely okay so what's your question so his response of uh my original Dennis responses is just one of those things happen\nOut now does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today with their dental implant ...\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants where you've been around so I I have no choice ah but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis that'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice worth\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things would happen this is malpractice on its face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are and there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in doing\nWell you can get it right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and then there was no problem and go to small claims court another problem is going to be you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna ... you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who is going to be a witness because he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things that he just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay and then I\n... be appropriate ... done\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing two or three and then see what the judge has to say OK okay alright try that I yeah genesis he spent all these years talking unit doing something\nWent in in ... when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nI Know you've probably heard by now a new hack or Facebook\nActually Facebook has had to ...\nWithin a couple of weeks of each other and it's

grain bill Yes sir well the\nQuestion concerning the ability of a person to decline a portion of an urgent specifically my father has a timeshare if he leaves it to me can I say yes to the rest of the inheritance but noted that sure and what would I ...\nI don't think so you can do you do it I mean there's nothing in the world I mean how can you be forced to accept property and then the ... in a case of a A N good for you by the way per se no in the case of a time share that's not property that's a liability\n... that's when it is so no you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee is say please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an owner of this property do whatever the hell you want with it but uh I'm done\nAnd could go back to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but uh they're not going to they're not going to sue ... they're not going to sue the state uh it's they are going to walk away from it\nSuch a thank you very much okay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract a state does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trustee would have negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed because it has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away and that's it you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare\nThat's for starters especially now with tied shares 'cause there are no longer you no longer owned the property it used to be you'd say you at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would own two parts of to let's say one fifty seconds\nOf the property there already is there is a deed you own property\nNow they just give you points you all nothing what you own is a contract in perpetuity\nWhere they have the right to raise maintenance fees every year or every three years or whatever the contract says forever\n\nAnd inevitably does anybody actually use time shares once in a while I run across someone that yeah loves the time share and yes thought it was the greatest deal but that's one out of all\nFifty maybe alright Eddie Hi any going on over ... sure\nUm my wife and I owe broke our ... our landlord lived in um New York long story short one hundred dollar of our deposit\nBecause I'm an older\nOne done one of my little loving it started to leave 'em mouthwash bottle on the counter and uh apparently what they call\nAn ethical burn a little ring from the mouthwash bottle um um my my my argument and their their mouth rock bottom Jonah let the little room there you know how is that our that our fault\nYeah which ... which are arguing that wear and tear effectively\nThat swearing and and what an outside the use of the jar account or was it for the Melbourne yeah okay fair enough so what's your question my question is he's keeping that two hundred dollar kinda running down it All right what's your question um how do I get my yard bucks that you're doing the right to it yeah I think\nSo based on what you said because if he's the one that put it in a counter that if ah it it's\nNot susceptible or it is susceptible to a ring around the counter are all based on mouthwash I mean you you're the one that just described it perfectly hey what do you expect there won't be a bottle of mouthwash\nOn the counter what ... what did you expect you're the one that put in the wrong material\nAnd are there are a yeah I don't know if you know this but if you go to one of these marble yards these rock ... yards or counter or manufacturers put encounters there is but civically ah anti mouthwash counters that you know that\nNo no I did there in the dirt is anti mouthwash counters I just made that up so [laughter] uh\nSo it seems to me that the argument is normal wear and tear the tenant is never responsible for normal wear and tear and you're going to argue that what you did it for about ... a bottle in their shots like everybody else does and that's your problem and you're still in the small claims court for the Fifteen hundred dollars not that complicated and if I'm a judge I'm going to give it to you\nVery good try yeah\nNow do you think it'd be easier to go after him or to go after via the mouthwash company\nOh please ... you\nWant to go after Proctor and gamble okay do me a favor and said they were mouthwash is so acidic\nGoes through counters and see what their lawyers are going to say\nI really like a stupid that's out at ... ... well you're absolutely right I couldn't agree with you more so I didn't have to say how stupid that was the lead me to the punch good for him but [noise]\nThis is handle

brought it back to him it kind of church and other Ninety dollars you're looking at it\nAnd I'm\nLike you know you're not going to pick the right so we're not going to what's your question um okay so I think in the same court ... I Want to know if I could go after his life Arctic yeah no money\nOkay what do you go after his life as a let me ask you do you uh do you know any relatives abused who have a license maybe lawyers nurses or anybody I just you do some research and find out if anybody who was close to him has a a license because not only can you go after his license\nYou can go after their license\nAt for example let's say you have someone who is a a barber right or a works in a hair cutting salon you can you can take away their license\nNo white soon oh you can do is to him\n\nAnd if he doesn't have any money or you are and I want you to look this up as O L okay that's a legal doctrine you know that don't you [laughter] yeah you are screwed beyond screwed okay\nAh I Love that isn't that special All right norm norm [noise] hey y'all have Oh yes sir\nWe live in your every morning my wife and I love your chair ...\n... of it correct okay to literary question tore a bill\n'cause I'm I because time so literary I understand because yes because you're so literate yes\nI'm I'm I've written one book and I'm writing another one and then the first book we held off on publication because we were worried about we would describe a couple of experiences in hotels and it was all positive\nNothing negative or we were wondering if those hotels would try and do anything to us legally because we talk about them and we give their name to the oh\nNo no matter of fact even if they were negative and you give your name too do you give the hotel name out the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way this defamation or a or you can tell them what go ahead\nNo no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year accusing uh the hotel and having bedbugs in your story and he named the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but Hilton Marian Wright Wyndham just go through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel\nOr can they want to say that on the air bill why they don't know who you are\nAh well actually truthfully I'm I'm not sure if I can remember not faring of a it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way they're ... they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege that's recognized under the law so they could not happening\nWhat laws that what you that you know by\nThe way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's there no the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel\nI either a sales a receipt I mean my daughter had a a very old car or that she gave to a friend of hers\nAnd and and she made sure that it was ... she has to copy that is registered or you were going to say what\nAuction off the bike and someone else to record it recovered after for him\nBecause they impounded so just say no because you sold the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but a a mark your defenses are are attacking the three thousand dollar impound vi and somehow\nProving that you sold a biker gave it to your body and uh that's all you can do and maybe your buddy old tests\nSaying yeah ah he sold the bike to me uh and I saw him registering at ... I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have to have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all that saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue that feeds you obviously you tell a collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one how long does to you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd uh then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous ... even a disputed has your credit already been attacked\nRight yeah it probably will audit marker yeah probably will you\nGotta mess on your hands and there is a ... there's no good way out of this\nWhat my friend I mean half the money to alert or\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them\nAnd it goes by saying I'll give you half the money now\nI Know and but uh I I mean is that money more than anybody I'd rather get the money that's\nAll right well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pounds sand or you look at your credit you've got your choices none of them very good unfortunately\nAre not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the was very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about all I have you committed a crime yes or no right it's\nVery clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's the statute yes thirty five miles per hour is law went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff\nI loan you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just the sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and I'm Glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment\nOkay or Alexander Hi Alexander\nI'm here yes or what can I Do for you or\nI had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judgment disappeared and I receive a cat's always showed up that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay wait a sad you oh hold on a you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're you're a single so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYes okay so the IRS is now saying you are or you were forgiven this much\nDebt and uh and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't did they sue you or they just wrote it off\nThe uh original credit card company\nI owe Fifteen ... did did they write it off\nI don't know if they ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you were that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you and it it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay for you and\nYou can follow it a little bit better than the original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later that the IRS\nYeah no I understand since arrested ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nThe lights on for the amount that they fed I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original that fifty nine hundred high fencing our eyes that they are or if a copy of my credit report that showed fifty nine\nHotter it doesn't matter it ... it doesn't matter I don't care that\n... that they are or rather than reduce their from my thing valve and lie and hunter back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is Trent the credit card company and quite at that data from fifty nine at Nineteen nine you I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally Andy fault the point is there are no they they knew that there are no damn ... but they reduce it again\nNo not them the eye or is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no records now it's only been there done in a statute is done even though they're like the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter ... they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nNinety or not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nThe question is that the credit card company and played at the original amount\nYes they did four times over yes there is no records I guess though\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you want me to go out in dollars and I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no haven't you paint you sounds and\nOh\nGod we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I Want to fight it at\nTwenty five thousand dollars just because the patients issue good God take me for an idiot yeah they do I guess people take me for a complete moron bill\nLet me explain how this works I got it let me explain again I got it no no I I Want you to give some
