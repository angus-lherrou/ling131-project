good record in however have a right to I've cooked up to a form of of course their perspective and plenty\nOkay I I'm All right you're you're saying ah the form he's asking you to fill out a W to form or are you talking about a previous W to form for a previous job\nA ... a previous that we have to form a\nFor free from previous jobs yeah no it doesn't have it doesn't have the right to do that uh because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary was based on it because it's one of his business how much money you earned that the previous\nIn employment\nSo no cars you know he doesn't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\nQuick arrive at ...\nYeah there's a particular law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously\nHandler and don't\nTell you to form a previous W to form says exactly that well so even if it wasn't the law I just saying you can't do that you say no\nWhat are you doing\nYeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a so uh no I don't think ah that works or John Hi John you're up\nIn that room rent but not all amount um they didn't pay 'em the amount that carried on it that they gave 'em 'cause they're claiming that there are no damage to their\nCurrent so are you talking about [laughter] so you're talking about they moved out right John\nThey are in the hot that the memory now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this you know or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\nOr do they pay the rent but adopted that deposit that\nThey gave yeah they do that all the time All right so what's your question [noise]\n[noise] so my question and um I I brought it up to them and they are claiming that on Iraq and I mean I called and emailed them\nWell okay I don't know what's going on right\nOkay here is here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the rent there was no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue and the security deposit is about\nProtecting you from damage\nA particularly protecting you from damage or to the property so I assuming that there is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying where to put the security deposit towards the last one threat and you're saying no you can't do that so\nYou have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against the rent so it becomes a wash\n... so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash and then the issue is if there are damages beyond that then of course you sue them in small claims court [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] yeah then you still then you so then you do then you do then you have a small claims shoe\nBut other than that no we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what why even bother\nSteve hello Steve I Want to you\nSir yeah you know for some reason uh I I've been listening to the show or you know sort of during the week uh been

money on the other side does he have some bucks\nMore and I get ... you know yeah okay yeah and then you definitely want to\nYeah you wanna you wanna definitely talk to a lawyer there's no question about it now here is ah I think the question and maybe one of the most important questions because you know what you know what the defense is to a defamation suit\nNo okay the defense is the truth so Erica ... do you have\nAn STD blow off oh wait a second you said that pretty forcefully matter of fact you say that a little bit to forcefully if you really want to know into quickly if you know what I'm Talking about ... procession protest too much\nOkay or get on the yeah yeah that's another a concept in the law ... dos protest too much I just wanted to say OK\nDefamation liable per se love that and that was like no one does that anymore but I Love the low some disease one and then ... and attacking women's virginity I mean how ... ... is that huh\nOh yes All right Rita Hi Rena\nHello Rita

and do they stop you from leaving Israel yeah ah and why do they stop you from leaving Israel\nThey couldn't tell me they think you have to say that I Am and to find out what fucking than that at All right but I decided that I don't I maybe I can do it\nFrom from from California so I had to pay and they actually to pay cash and who do you have to pay cash\nGod\nAnd why do they say you owe them a ... this amount of money\nThey tell me that that you have to say that I have to find out why working they're mad and I\nDo you know how much you do you know how much you owe them\nThey don't need a thousand dollars okay and you're paid them three thousand dollars yes okay then you got on the airplane and you came back to the United states yet All right and your question is do I have a case against to the state of Israel\nYes yes I Do have a case okay first of all um have you ever seen my a bar license my license to practice law\nNo you haven't ... I Do know where a unlicensed\n... okay state of California are you won't notice the state of Israel on there are also ...\nYeah so what I Would do is go to the Israeli consulate and ... and you know what you can get a lawyer or through the consulate that specializes in Israeli American law there are some uh who are and they'll give you the name of them but\nI don't know why Israel is asking for three grand\nMaybe ... maybe some executive ah\nMaybe somebody in the government won an extra three thousand dollars 'cause this kid was a short three grand for the bar mitzvah I have no idea the point is\nI don't know Israel right now\nOr if you were to ask me about ... Sierra Leone eat\nThat's a different issue because I happened to be an international lawyer who has expertise in Sierra Leone the law I don't know if you knew that\nOh wow oh that was terrific alright EJ Hi AJ\nHigh on yes ma'am I'm I have a car loan or without it recently found out I didn't have the heart title I contacted the fighting company and they thought that he had everything that title\nBecause you there that there are two hundred dollar ... lately I got from the duration out alone [laughter] I've never been contacted the loan is like five years old now it's not on my credit um how what are what should I Do\nHear that title see that's a problem or is that you're entitled to title if you read and\nBut they're the ones that are holding it and they won't transfer the title to you and are you trying to sell the ... or sell the car\n[noise] correct yeah so you're gonna miss ... what about the statute of limitations exactly\nOh no no that's exactly it ah they've got a statute issue uh there there are all kinds of problems they have so uh do you have a couple of choices you didn't pay the money under protests\nAnd let them know you're ... I Would let them know that you're paying the money are based on the fact that they won't turn title over to you even though you believe that\nUh they don't have the right but you need to sell the car I put the oldest in writing\nAnd and ah then you turn around you sue him for the money better on day I was hotlines courts that the important thing is that you have to have title and they're holding it up\nCorrect and what they're doing is extorting you okay and uh\nSo e you might even have a a good law suit for extortion or where are you going for punitive damages\nWell it's only Thirteen hundred dollars and it doesn't matter explosions explosion\nI talked to and I ... I Would talk to on a journey on this one just to see if there is anything going against his lender or ... what\nKind of attorney I civil attorneys fine that little tiny ... by one on your wife yeah absolutely yeah absolutely yeah just go to handle All right you got it\nI hate would that happen same thing happens with credit reporting agencies same thing happens with foreign companies with utility company they hold all the cards they're saying fine you think you have a dispute okay we're shutting off your phone until you pass\nRight we're shutting off your water and power and do your parents\nWere not giving your child to the car until you pay us even though somehow we don't deserve it because the statute of limitations is run [noise]\nThis is handle on the mall [noise]\n[laughter]\nWell duty AG meant W.

call fair enough sure\nHi Sam welcome to handle on the law for morning I Am a chore\nDriver and I have a question concerning whether or not I'm a contractor or or eat 'em and I've never owned by a truck I worked for sure uh solely for one company\nAnd uh when I worked for the orientation they had me sign a ten Ninety nine for after I was wondering if that's what do you go no nope nope nope nope nope\nIt use ... as it since you work for the company and they own the truck your employee and do they determine where you deliver and do they determine your hours that sort of saying\nExactly oh you are so you are so an employee\nRight at what happened is I got hurt last year and ... what was that I was a contract signed for no it\nDoesn't matter or it's do you 'cause you're are you oh that's funny to foreign was pure ... that they wouldn't give you a job unless you've signed it there in violation of law big time so you are entitled\nTo workers' comp disability and they're going to get nailed you about just make a a complaint to the labor board and they were going to get nailed beyond nailed\nAll right and one last question ... got hit by the car was that a mitigating factor and the guy trial\nNo it was not he hasn't been try he hasn't been tried yet [noise] you know not a he's a yeah and what makes it even worse with the beaver is I understand it was a particularly ugly beaver\nI mean I can see a good looking fever even have attraction to good looking deeper but an ugly beef or not I don't think so ah Victoria oh no it's a Eddie is supposed to you for a moment Eddie hello\nYeah\nI'm I'm about to get into my wife and I get to\nThis point in time that I'm about to get out that we have together a thing about a month to find out if I ever buy something right now than it should be able to get it and let me point\nOut yes and she's obligated but it doesn't mean she's going to you\nBecause what you want to do is ah you're relying on her agreement in writing\nTo uh go ahead and change ah I changed titled the house or allow the uh the ... but the bottom line is uh you can't force her\nTo sign all you can do is to her after the fact that she does ... maybe you can get a now I don't think so a court order this going to force you to sign but I don't think so I think\nIf she changes her mind she changed her mind and you let her know inch snow uncertain terms that if she just changed your mind she's bought herself a world of litigation\n[noise] but I wouldn't be able to her I think so I Would never damages yeah I think so okay All right yeah\nAnd you hate her anyway so what difference does it make All right now Victoria Hi Victoria\n[noise] I get money I had an a or writing or reading a tech communication which I'm not feeling\nYou talking about right you might do basically driving while texting right\nYeah okay but not All right and they're very well nation wide I don't actually hang it up and like\nYeah I was hoping I mean like Robert license in my possession isolated giving the ... like them but I bet on there is also a good reason for that and it's a matter of whether or not the judge will seem like it or anything below me off\nThat's exactly correct It's a matter of whether the judge will see a well look at you and believe you were not believing so what is what is your question\n[noise] my question is she white number one what are the possible ... years I could\nJust showing or exactly what you said you plead not guilty and you explain why you're not guilty okay and they're going to put the cop on the stand who's going to probably do a whole different story and it's up to the judge to determine who is telling you the truth and who isn't\nThat second part I'm In Africa in ... choice like corrupt or not you know listening to\nYou know that's not corruption that's uh just notoriously believing officers versus leaving drivers\nWell sure and that is by the way most jurisdiction because here's a philosophy you have every reason to lie because you have all the skin and again a cop theoretically has no reason to lie he's objective so from the beginning you're going up hill\nYeah All right so all you can do is tell your story and

actually it's a lesson part time and they've done that for this reason I'm I'm getting ready to retire when I had taken um days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally taken a few it and put them on the book the sick days [laughter]\nBut um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\nTrain them at the end either take a pay out or um take time off prior to my retirement I'm looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year um I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it\nOn the same because I Am part time work to less than twenty hours on it so what's your question do I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the policy of the school board\nAnd the policy in which you hired is that\nPeople were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whenever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school board some companies allow people to take sick days like police departments for example usually do\nSo uh you got cops that retiring literally your ears were sick leave but they pull out early and then there are companies and uh they're our enemies that say no for example uh my my company this anniversary good parenting it's\nUsing or lose it Mm same thing uh I work for this radio station it to use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I could have is if I had because I'm part that if I took a different um government job that was over twenty hours\nRight well I mean whenever the policy is\nYeah then it could it 'cause it stays with me I got\nYa okay but it's whatever the policy is you have to live within the policy and it is perfectly legal to have a policy that says using her lose it yeah that was which I Do and not only do I haven't my company ah but I also live under it\nYeah yeah well yeah you're screwed I congratulate you so there is no case here\nOh no oh Nick [noise] bill or or\nUm renting this class and they got a new property management company and so uh they wrote the rules and all that good stuff I'm supposed to sign for the for the complex or

[noise]\nUm [noise] if this turns into like a big problem in the future or something I could take my landlord with small claims court about\nMaybe like ah the first thing you're going to argue is you're not responsible\nNegligent or what does that mean I don't know is it what can you do that would cause the plumbing issue rather than block up a toilet for example or or ah I don't even know other than that\nBlock I was thinking of toilet or what pipes undoing a soldering on just unraveling so I don't quite get it and that did you sign the agreement with a new company\nNo haven't find that's too bad and you say no thank you I'm not saying I'm not accepting this cloud of leasing\nAgreement or a seem to be a contract or anything it's just like grain to the rules\nAre changing the rules so you say I don't agree to it now if the lord says you're agreeing to what you've agreed to it\nOkay All right and so I don't know if they're asking for individual owners\nOr they are going
