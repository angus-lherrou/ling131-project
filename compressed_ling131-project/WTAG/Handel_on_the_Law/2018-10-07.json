yeah OK\nWhile they're doing is they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know you have it they ever have to go through the home that the government because they have so much money are comeback she's getting paid for it because she's on Medicare they're saying that that government could comment on that money\nNo unless she is she had been is uh she had been a fishery of ah the ... of the narrowest\nVeterans with regards to my parents if something were to happen to my parents and they were going to go home and the Senate ... yeah and they're saying that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be in the ... trust where you're [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all the trust is set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that\nThey don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go on I think not Medicare uh and I and I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you\nGo on the government Dole and pay for for example a home or to live for folks living with\nA million dollars in the bank that's just not going to happen now a lawyer's\nDay that's going to cause Fifteen thousand dollars to do that\nTo what to change it to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the

service animals you probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are ... you know yeah that I don't know that I don't know I bought for you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so right the bottom line is that for one service animal and it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a city and emotional support or is it a straight out service animal\nAh no no respect for an emotional\nCello yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't they [laughter] yeah yeah they're not that they're now I understand right I Want someone wants to ask me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I said probably not\nSo the quick answer is\nI have no idea if a money can be charged but if it I Can't it would be under those circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there's a big difference we know train service animal in this emotional support crap\nYou know like they do on airlines peacocks and ferrets and whatever the hell because you can call any animal as service\nAnimals and uh what are you going on ... which is I take a flock any [noise] All right\nThis is a handle on the law Glenn Beck

Bye bye bye And anyway long story short he as soon as we hired her at length about a month and they get on my daughter started playing\nAnd get her knees on and we went and saw the doctor and that said you know ...

I just don't understand people who are in business of doing business like that we're we're saying contract\nThe only changed the date and uh the amount of money that's paid why you would have a non refundable retainer why you would say this contract is only good for six months a year Eighteen months I mean that just sloppy as hell or it's that simple\nDenise Hi Denise yes ma'am\nRight yeah my brother and I um my parents had an elderly um lead to a campground [noise] ah we all enjoy it um but as they are there to our my brother took it over\nDid he took it over in the east signed it right he actually accepted the contract\nOkay\nCalled an undergrad at least hold interests have about a year ago and said why me nine years yeah\nUh I Can't do this because the fact that they can pretty much a gesture feet up and they can they can\nCan you know call him and find a good lawyer he goes well I got a lawyer but that I'm looking at all of them at their scams\nOh yeah most most of those people who are you out of time shares more ... or ...\nOr you know what I did one ah yeah I Know and uh I ... and and\nThe problem I've been asked to add\nThe area where you're changing the euro being here I'm standing there [noise] church refuses to identify that pretty [noise] we were getting to the point where I was trying to create attorneys and the media and all that out about\nI didn't want to file sharing because it could get it we're out there I wanted to keep it between me and the work\nMike let me ask a why is it important for the second priest to be identified that's not going to bring that much more value or any more value I'm assuming you have a a lawsuit going or negotiations for money with the church correct\nWell when it got to the negotiating experience and part of the money they\nChange their tactic at first they were acting like there were some fear and nine and I said okay well we get to the money um I don't even make that large of a good man I went off you know the other alter boy federal wherever I went with us from that just to get\nThis over now are you are you doing this without a lawyer or what are you crazy [noise] [noise] well you're\nCrazy Mike what do you what are you doing talking to the Catholic Church the archdiocese about being abused negotiating for a a money settlement and you don't have a lawyer\n[noise] well I wanted closure and I didn't want to put my family for a years long in a trial and\nThey want me to trial there won't be a trial they'll settle they'll settle now\nBut what you want as a lawyer who has experience there are several lawyers out there and you can just research them who are this is what they do they developed an expertise or the archdiocese know who they are ... the lawyer will know the value of your case\nNot can probably force\nThe issue of the the force the issue of or the or\nThe identity of the other a priest for whatever reason I don't know if it's the purposes of are you getting closer that you think it's fair and that's been\nGoing there and I and I think it was because they were the cover up that happened oh yeah who you are kidding reported of core and of course you know it\nWasn't like I just ... charges up out of nowhere\nYeah Mike or don't worry about you you have I mean you have a very valid case and then the issue is well let me ask you how important is it let's say everything else is coal pathetic let's say are you a settled with uh the archdiocese there you have a reasonable settlement under the circumstances whatever the value is\nA then how important is it for the identity of the second ... cars being molested as being molested mean whether you were molested by one priest Fifteen times or three priests five times a I Would argue it's St maybe it's not\nMaybe there's a lot more value in terms of the case or having been a molested by two different ... I don't know the answer was how important\nIt was actually initially when I went to them I just want to know my memory that come back I dealt with that\nI got my life back on track everything's going smoothly I married a wonderful woman got custody of my shoulder on everything and it's going great and I didn't want to rock the boat I just want her to get closer I was even asking for money when I initially went there and they started to push back\nNo I don't I understand now and say you went you went through that they're not being cooperative they've gone from gee we care and we feel bad for you to stonewalling it which is a the history of ah the Catholic Church when\nThey're actually a lot more people that weren't stonewalling they wanted to get an investigator and fall\nYeah that's what they do I mean my family I get it in my community and got ...\nLet me tell you I I'm a big fan and I always get in trouble for this always and that is I Believe that the archbishop ships the bishops the cardinals even the pope's last several folks have covered all of this up\nAnd shut all go to jail we have a a a cardinal ... uh Mahoney who used to be the cardinal here in Los Angeles ... and he retired with accolades\nAnd he retired uh with the ... an eminent if you will or an eminent\nReputation he should be in jail he should be in jail for\nCovering up what happened when I went to ... okay so here's your choice here's my advice if you're asking I Would get a lawyer that specializes in going after the church they know what all these lawyers incident lakes are the ones I've talked to were the ones I've heard of it\nI actually do care and if it's a question of you need therapy more than you need money or you need both and negotiate with the church that's the way to go\nOut and my question is do I get out because obviously the climate look all these people coming our yeah me too\nYeah yeah actually and that's actually what would have prevented me from firing on the first place but I didn't want to be involved in the bandwagon\nYou're not going to be on the bandwagon and she was an individual\nThat do I need to get\nOut now the lawyer ... not a lawyer that's why you want a lawyer that's why you want the lawyer who has experience and we'll sit down and give you all the options and we'll give you the options that makes sense\nTaking into account the value of the case or your particular predicament in terms of your mental health your\nEmotional psychological situation or these guys know what they're doing you got to go there you actually have to go there and it's easy all you do is throw up a ... or some uh search words Catholic Church lawyers um ride yeah law firms are suing the church\nAnd I I wouldn't put up a church or molestation pills you'll get forty thousand hits on\nThat [noise] All right I hear it's not as warm where really quick heart what\nPart of it is okay now can I included the death of my mother and I\nI don't know I Know no I don't know probably not but I don't know the answer again go to the lawyer they have the expertise alright or he or she or the ...\n... it has the expertise\nAnd uh let me tell you about a life walk\nLife lock

Dodgers hear it on this station and a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio when I was doing some recording and I was

handling along [noise] couponing Yes sir I'm trying to figure\nOut how to get someone to live up to the other false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck alright I'll just tell me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that ah I bought from a dealership and it two years into the leaf they sent me a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought their car and not\nAnd then when I went and good program on it and they have praised the car and the way out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition [noise]\nAh ... we'll give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially [noise] definitely says this away rates are paired up are you up to a hundred percent of the current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is what is the value of the car\nOr that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not about not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original ... deals to show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the car ... appraisal or they're just saying we don't care what the racial came higher than ... oh my God okay so\nSo so they ... they put it up to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and like I I don't know nothing about that you brought the manager out I gave him the document and the email and he goes\nOkay we'll get we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean you're a cart was showing condition it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been for a two year early on at least that time and he goes [noise]\nWe'll give you the deal but you need about when our cars and I and I go out ... highlighted another thing I go but it says you'll buy micro no matter what buyers are not actually as well and they they just stumbled on themselves\nRight well I didn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask this\nUh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars\nOr just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're watching the lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them and that and my truck I drive thirty five of 'em out here in my car sits in the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are you so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back ah and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they are releasing a too yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and now here's here's\nWhere I figured out the dad 'cause it's been a year and I've gone through\nBut right now I got it okay all I have a a you could sell the car or to anybody else at whenever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was with a hundred and ... percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know picking up here [laughter] so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they were going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem with the damages are and how you figure out\nI God they\nCause I ah the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for a belief you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent\nI so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court I but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out now isn't it\nYou can't when it comes to math\nBeyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr a hundred divided by two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy\nHi Tammy yes good morning
