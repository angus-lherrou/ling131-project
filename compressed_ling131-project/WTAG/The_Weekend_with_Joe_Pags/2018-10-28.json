ADHD Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nTwenty nine criminal counts I'm Del Walters Fox News that's what the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings now faces eleven for using a firearm to commit murder at this hour or two of the victims are still fighting for their lives victims of twenty minutes of terror this morning at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only get appropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter advocating rational baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nThat's also not being honest and they start reporting the news as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know is name although it's been reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd ... also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American as first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a child and then fill up you know\nThe media always do quick\nTo say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of 'em in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to us raid is again\nAnd that's where we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nOut a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convince door really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses armies when fake addresses on the actual said into our area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their offices\nThey never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow\nInciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou have you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor putting that's okay that's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example at resemble Yvette\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or anxious over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living I'll make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you\nSo I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\n\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was unhinged that's irresponsible\nThat's responsible\nOr by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name\nOne name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\n\nSo whatever the the leftist trying to glean from him and pin it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not go there observing and tell us why Trump caused that that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take us impulse led called ...

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with the illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way\nAnd and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to or has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate you how're you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nAnd listen always appreciate it really had a good time with you at the fair and get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six want to do for his standing next to you but uh it it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw you out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people I've seen police officers you know guys like this to who walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't think I've seen some\nWho I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to two I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together but at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what is what it is going on in their life to put him to this point so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we've tried to go from there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that humans can attract more flies and then you can then ...\nAnd in watching you interact with again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this or somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but\nIs there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those ...\nOr ... difficult to deal yeah and that you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness in power if you walk up your calm and they can steal that they don't feel you're wrapped up in your it really helps that situation go a lot smoother event you have to arrest\nIt ended up going to last forever but there's some people that are just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching you would share of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like live pd and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that you know it's kinda it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and it we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently or did you think if you just stay calm which work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get back on and on charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I said that your guest it's a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am\nA where the where the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws oh in force these laws you seem to be a guy that says no here's the book this is where the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them what reaction do you get from people in our county the residents there last question marketing appreciate\nThe time or what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get here we're going to make sure that we we you know\nStick to the laws are in our is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands not the majority of the people understand the immigration issue we're dealing with\nCars running from us almost ... almost every night were given the drugs coming into our community or you've been affected by heroin and by a by standing on by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public in our youth hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county we get for the most part yeah and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect to be I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from our up from the people in town\nOr good is it they sound like very good people and they certainly have a great sheriff sheriff mark lamb but al ... Arizona thanks a million I appreciate you\nThank you Joe appreciate it we appreciate the share of coming out he's a good guy I I I think that he's one of the best that we have in the country and uh if you haven't caught him on life beauty hopefully will be will be on there again we're going to probably talk to them again next week because of the Caribbean is getting that much closer\nAnd without a doubt his agency is going to have to take some action to keep the people that county I'm safe and and that's the job we appreciate him your thoughts on that one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot com we're coming right back there to claim\nRight here on what's going on you\n... roller it's an offer me automatic tax message Muscatine originally apply\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook great tasting dinners at home and easy to forget about frozen foods and take out and said during me for great home cooked food introducing Martha and Merle eastern meal kids repression fresh ingredients with my wonderful easy to follow recipes delivered break your door\nAnd right now you can try three for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free Martha and Merle eastern meals to everyone from anywhere\nImagine cooking butter based at stake for sheer pork tenderloin key stuffed chicken and more with new recipes every week Martha and released to and helps you put a delicious dinner on your cable and around thirty minutes\nFor three free meals and free shipping patched young to cure for six eight ten just kept the word ... to to find a pen for details hurry three free won't last long taxed young to two four six eight ten\n[noise] some people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling the thing is [noise]\n\n... how do we get one job I had one eight hundred and five ... all one Seventy eighty will to one of your phone calls today\nSo there's going to do a parody of pads power to you guys live for those with your new to the program first of all where have you back on the news for a long time second of all if you listen to my Monday through friday showed the Joe ... show aptly named\nUm you know that I Do ...

Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code words ... playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about him and I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI\nShows was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police and law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history of uh of problems you know a ... and in fending and in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do you know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to green how much damage would have been done\nBut can you imagine you know had like a low on right\nLet me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a\nA R e ... advice early on and said you know someone stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady the house ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him the demography bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber speak to people did not called the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nStandard shooter or so why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I'll tell you a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had to miss the shooting by only a few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or apt I took some a swing state do you want to take some ground or is the second I looked out the was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just\nFour minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is all the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge incivility or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence\nAnd then rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the pilots happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and then that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is that the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nBut I had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished\nTo what Ronald Reagan accomplished and in fact there's thirty five forty years later the media looks back in ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point what thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and ignited prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success yet the media again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin\nPretty House Ways and Means Committee chair it'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I don't even have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking\nPencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American to pay taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no\nManufacturing stuff here again or promising yes\nTo start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that suggest as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent", "year": "2018", "show_name":
