making it high time investor dot com that high time investor dot com I times holding\nWhile now so I've done that is also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories on the left hand side\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions\nOr was it the power I don't know what the hell when it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine that would be nuts\nThat would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian\nWhy am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact for admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been making this claim but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls are both gone is I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it aren't very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou don't like Rachel does all who's white like Sean King who's white\n\nYou know they're both pretending to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\n\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said you a DNA test if you could prove to be that you're in India and I'll give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test\nGet to the test back and gives the results of the Boston Globe what'd you say far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\n\nAnd then the Boston Globe how to four hours later updated and correct it and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nAnd in fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\n\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBut the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren that's a fact I mean making it up it's a fact she's not an ... an American Indian she's gotten\nFor pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved ...\nOh did he or\nShe is so not American indian but the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [laughter]\nSharing the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation vets the world in which we live\nGuy looked at St in that any time you\nGo through this week thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself while she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story anybody any of us should even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse\nThrough lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second yet

this week of course the son of president Donald Trump on all things that you would imagine we talked about Eric I appreciate you how're ya hey back how are you\nI mean I'm I'm living the dream but it's it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debate when I was you know it's going to be Ted Cruz taking on a Robert phrases work he's calling themselves ... for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen in San Antonio tonight in that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\nAs he gave her thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and then the the amount you I hear people say to me well my guy guys Trump he's on the you know he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nGo as a country where winning and then everything about our country is winning right our economy\nIs on fire at Fort Point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years you know we have\nLargest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation for one k.'s it through the roof small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were a year ago which is just created such kept you know financial engine\nUm I mean we are dealing so incredible that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done and opioid crisis the taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind um you know and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now as you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right all while America has the strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning this thing right and and that's what he promised the American people he was getting a daily promise the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get used and abused in the country and\nThe people have to get out there they have to get out and vote\nIt's Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races each very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you've seen those all the advertising you're saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give it a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent up a vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing that's ally that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut\nAnd corporations will employee us got a tax cuts are all making more money some people got bonuses so how do you think about the law is when you see them lying around about\nIt honestly they're truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty in politics again this is this an worlds right we're business people who are not we don't we don't come out of a right out of the political world these people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small business and you write all across our\nOur nation they're getting their pay Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point nine percent unemployment is ... have the lowest Hispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\nDo you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with\nThe China where if you said the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five to fifty percent and terrorists right where they could make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I mean if it's absolutely unbelievably well we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean ... it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nOr some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases\nBelieve me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nThat it's Eric Trump persona president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people up those or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding employees instead of flushing the with Obama you're alone\nThey slash the employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we're gonna do it the ... do you use it in a way we're going to do with them and made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how we're just yet\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world you know those people to keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars\nAnd healthcare costs you know food through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um legislation that rice has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you you look at a right to try to look at so many of these different efforts and\nYou know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves elected so their sales people that's who he is I mean he's he's the one guy who's probably ever come into government who had the worst of life you know then\nBut you know he's a counter punch your rights and and and and he's a fighter hey if in fact sometimes to his detriment probably but I don't know how you change somebody DNA right if they're if they're a fighter and you want this country was missing a fighter for a long time we didn't have a fighter in the White House for a long long time\nAnd it's nice to have a fighter there again that's why we're winning these paid ... ... and so maybe this team ... does it mean to step on your feet what's allowed or they may be trip you up on some last year but\nYou want that personality you want the person who will will swing back when they feel that they're being taken advantage of where they're being used where they're being [noise] um and it and it's fundamentally ingrained in his DNA and um and I think it's exactly what this country needs and [noise]\nAnd uh and I'm proud of him I'm proud of everything that he's accomplished and um he's awesome guy having you know and but he's just an awesome guy and he is doing an incredible incredible\nHe really is a you know you couldn't be more correct about that Eric Trump to use the son of the president also trumpeter national or do you ... you're going to be in Texas who and let's let's hook up and let's let's sit down and talking into go Ted Cruz would it be pushing for tonight after the

E. A. and I know\nI'm just saying and I follow you and your husband asked me I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but when I was perfectly fine it's fun to buy that\nOK appreciated um you know traditionally you bring up Kavanaugh I've been told him to the cabinet bones but it happened shortly but I feel like things might pull down before the midterms and been dying and Feinstein yesterday like gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into you know justice coming on Mars you said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because he thought how crazy they got during the actual confirmation process\nIt's it's really terrifying it is then finally showing their true colors that Democrats are they really don't stand for much except trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think\nThat you eat so much with resistance out there is because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is winning for the country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life is over and they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington D. C. or not go in and and voting on behalf of their constituents so\nIt makes it scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's he's doing this because he loves his country to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more reason that we need\nAll the Republican support we can and Congress\nThat is a lawyer Trump but really great to talk to your brother in law ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\n... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rice um but but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law and do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara with trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it it's so much bigger than any of us but\nThat's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president gets attack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of things going on here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president of a I asked him back in twenty six teams\nOf because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this and I asked him was this completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media\nYou told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this show when we when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wine to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president at roadside hum but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn\nChild needs to make this talk about it is it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before the ... president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life was going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you

to war if you look at places like Michigan we're ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat showed
