the solar flower lays flat\nSo there's almost no wind resistance and then when the wind starts towards thirty nine miles an hour it just folds itself clothes\nSo that kinda cool 'cause I mean like I if you I can see it at festivals rock concerts that kind of thing I could see it as you know events like chili cook off but I Know that there's going to be a pretty hefty price tag for this\nYeah okay well okay it is almost twenty five thousand dollars however\nCheaper than the robotic wine cellar we gotta\nYes yes by half by ... and the government does not give you thirty percent back on the wine cellar\nBut uh but if you're\nA business or residential the guy said you get an automatic thirty percent rebate from the government if you are a business you get the thirty percent back and you can

as\nMuch solar power as you use currently you can't over install and I thought well why not if everybody put an extra thirty percent and you know and that that's the problem and put the genie out of business which in my opinion is not a bad thing at all\nNo what do you like to every month sending them a bill yeah yeah you owe me for all of its electricity and and you know I Would like to find out how this compares\nTo our you know roof installation\nYeah still the guy said this will power a smaller house a cabin with smaller if you have a mini mini house uh I think he said an eagle it no I'm

H. D. Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nListening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her greens if he hears the odds then\nAnd the whole thing is odd but was among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody has presented as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist honor all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an actor that you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son ... you'll normally present the person and say\nHere's why you want to hear from this person on some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for the appearance or an analyst\nGenerally speaking you ever is getting paid too but they keep on presenting a listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today I'm I'm confused\nWhy are we doing a story on a list of a lotto I don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy for and what have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care why all is I'm a lot of things why she's not an expert\n\nI talked about this while I'm Talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes the people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time and we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nA list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out there like a like me to buy into this far left wing garbage\nAlyssa mulatto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't win the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb vis the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should\nNot just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\n\nBut there you go you turn on the job or you're you're read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we shouldn't believe or you should believe all is a mulatto because fill in the blank\nJust doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ...\nRobbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost\nAnd had to surrender to to us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ...\nPeriod and the story and of course that's the only period and the story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert ... on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't have the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised will Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Robert ... are they telling the truth yes\nBut it's also a sin of omission or a lie of omission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert de leaving left and waved to the crowd fame they're fantastic it's what is the best thing ever going to go to my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar\n[noise] a better thing to say it might be what he really said\nGrant was so freaking good vetting kicked vis guys asking this guy was really good\nBut\nThat was the context but why tell the truth when you can lie and then correct it later and by the way on social media when you lie under your your legacy media

with a therapy would yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened\nAnd and I show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and or do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska\nBut do lose job with boys and girls that surveillance Sarah how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday because the people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or all of you are listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening is what is a good point they submitted you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise [laughter] six\nHad gone back and forth now and I said oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get along so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Los Angeles and I don't know what I'm trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah viewing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you listen to settle this once and for all and it's a good as we got to figure that fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd that's about it and then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the but you took my first time in ... her son Tina Fey that's her that's ... ... and not know you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right\nGuy at the right time do the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further\nWriting campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what your Senator Frank were kept yeah after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on German and I ran against him into heated rhetoric that we've got and that's how we stayed in the central command once you're in and you have a special interest from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no\nRational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she daddy good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know of course it is and whether either good manners\nYet I'm no no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles right very very very disappointed because you know as you suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's pretty in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska in this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much\nWithin its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you are you or your wife wasn't up in our circuit court of appeals at all ... of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course\nThe former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going to write of my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you so and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um the more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everywhere we would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment\nFor Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I Would go breath because nobody else was talking about that share um what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous another thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the light and is allowing Adam are only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nWould like these radical [laughter] you know we haven't gone I\nThink that the fact that you know no more become unhinged I I think the more that reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said nah enough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I think people like you got to be out there every day in the arena make it different where you guys do you\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah ... million along with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand and I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate your reaching out and thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much cricket you\nWe appreciate Sarah bailing taking the time you know it was interesting how we ended up connecting she's riding around in Alaska\nAnd listens to my program every day we're on it you know in in Anchorage I'm guessing that's where she hears it we're also on in a in Fairbanks but to have the opportunity to talk to her and she really doesn't have a similar if not even worth story being cabinet does because Kevin a way to put up with it for three weeks or or ten or eleven days\nWhere Sarah Palin had to put up with it for more than a year in her family to the microscope and just the\nThe craziness from the left them in the lawyer showing up in Alaska her perspective really made a lot of sense to me and I look I Hope she runs give Lisa Murkowski\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska when she voted no on Brett Kavanaugh I'm the reason she gave was because he's not the right guy at the right time which doesn't make any sense your thoughts on what you just heard one

Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel\nOn Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was going to in Tel Aviv is\n[noise] uh not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in\nThe United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be an all those markets because it's\nYou know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent ... and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a\nA R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy\nThat ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining you know good he's putting terms is going to ruin trade\nAnd in no time flat biggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade them in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas no are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen we make a part of the bill how does it go down\nThere he he obviously talks\nOf you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause of secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a a a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's\nA there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team and I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know\n... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] sure\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect\nTo see out of a negotiator a person who goes and what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen if I have trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a ... and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so did the Chinese\n... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs to originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later the Chinese know that they will lose a\nDay now that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so yeah\nI guess where their biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either\nOur international uh our our intellectual property\nRight but it is a good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great job it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before\nYou can actually get to a source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it is these things were outdated do you think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as side that was twenty five years ago and and\nThink about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint\nI mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are uh are developing the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different position than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president was that you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "year": "2018", "city":
