H. D. Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nCourse I'm rich Dennison Fox News it's\nNow Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh centered on\nSaturday with a narrow fifty to forty eight votes confirming the judge to the nation's high court's\nIt's one of the slimmest Supreme Court confirmation votes ever\nPresent nominated the jurors\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the claim\nWell Christie lousy Ford testified in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's orange credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was by Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nEverybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was so as much as she might have been believable that\nSomething happened to her and I hope she gets ... and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know if you do to spin the bottle or it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then uh she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but whose member were pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys are taking gang rape\nKavanaugh and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them in Nineteen eighty to ...\nSomehow was the victim and was gang raped will continue to go into the parties for another full year and instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the march she changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC\nNews instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then she said it's important to note that the stories you say today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times and her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he was guilty Cory Booker robots recalled Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that he made it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process it is in this country has guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer\nHas said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nun ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd received Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people who didn't come to conclusions offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir dock sing people which means are putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us would listen to the lotto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapist serial rapists at about a rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be in Saudi Arabia or something\nOr China oh man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now ... what\nCome home and\nSo I Need your thoughts on this I I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee every your life I guarantee that is true\nBut let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a politically you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree with Trump\nSecond ride stuck in the elevator with girls\nThey demanded it happened to be there to\nAh they they\nAn ... ah they they ...\nThey may say he\nWas ... ...\n... is a snake\nStill like the guy with a bowl I'm Glad\nIn a bad bank big [laughter]\nAh they ...\nThey say right case high bowed my wife no looting [noise]\nAh thing back back [noise]\nDo you do not the a\nLittle ah ... for your flake flakes lake I did go to just go and play play but I'm going to call it 'cause my ... am I going to do that but there you go a little some something for your thoughts on what's going down on what's happened so far and and again we do the show before\nA vote would have been taken on Saturday So or to keep a close eye on that there are a couple of big monkey wrench is that can be thrown in\nYou got this guy deems a believe a Montana\nWhose daughter is getting married today\nAnd as the father of my daughters I'm with a [noise]\nHe's got to be at his daughter's wedding we that's got to happen\nSo he's a Republican and he's a yes vote for Kavanaugh will he be there when the vote happens\nIf they have fifty that's enough because they've got Mike Pence will be the tie breaker\nVery very interesting to me\nThis is going to go down I Want to know where you are on this especially if you're on the left\nIf you agree that\nParty on the Web for Democrats went way

to be so again at Joe talk show a lot of people want to be heard on this confirmation process has been disgusting\nIt really has been enrolled it all started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize that Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member bunch then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad the letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nSo the matter what you think of Christie loves before she was a victim your two of the left politics\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this 'cause we're either a country divided or it could work country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to and even centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close in the house but I think we have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political left let me go to the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nIn the morning and go hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and you know where in favor of that and I'm really disappointed in every ... getting ... sticking out stronger during the early\nProcess that having even more upset with the Democrats and to fit in their ... not a fan get your act together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting this crap and and get very disappointed in the whole process and that kind of and needs to be elected the next ... court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture with the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you know all this fake outrage about how Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think lower started there were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that\nThere are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans a grassy ... I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on and hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of the city I Will clear this room and be given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol\nIs when they were breaking it on purpose\nBecause they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nHey Joe ... thank you very much for taking my call really you've got a I think the Democrats are dead and so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month that just getting worse and worse and they try to take this man down they get it very frustrating\nOr the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man next and guilty and you got to live for the most out if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice eat he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have due process in this country now and understand\nAnd would it would Alexandria Ocasio Cortez just said and that answer to this door code MSNBC made no sense and I actually started doing the barest for one eight hundred

here on the weekend with Joe pads we go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a Christie in Carson City Nevada crispy what's going on\nOh lots of stuff going on [laughter] on TALK to me I just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing the man to be a um fair and fair and honest person to decide Supreme Court cases right we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry and when he was accused of these faceless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of a sexual assault more than one\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let\nOff allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to prove that was cabinet right if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that\nOr or many other things and the fact that we would want this\n... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh who surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became a citizen and she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair\nRight we get that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correct I mean he's used racing something one of the most dogs there are things I've ever seen and then be chargers no go and be fair and and liberal he ended about this oh I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was lousy boar doesn't remember anything does that mean in his room so you just all the victims\nThe survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered everything\nWhere she lost to me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I'd written single parent household with that there were six cats when I was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't tell my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right so when she first started to live with me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure to say Hi\nTo someone that was in that room where I found my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home at gunpoint front of my family when I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us how to identify him\nBut I became physically ill and I have a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I can remember what I was wearing\nEvery single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and cemented in my memory\nAnd I just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and I honestly I hate beta that I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I\nWas in law enforcement and I know what the standards are right my got on her is now she's\nAnd I'm ... I'm with you but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before no matter what she says the word we're going to use as credible to everybody that we talked to and we're going to force them to repeat credible\nBecause then the the watching eliciting public will will agree\nBut she was credible but I I've I'm with you and I and I said there's really gone may I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usually about words and that's where I was I and and I was attacked because I said that but so what I mean I saw when I saw heard what I heard\nAnd even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I I what what meal in a way it how much I have personally been attacked\nBy ... survivor ... call them back then\nBecause they allowed it to the point that like write me away as I had a guy friends that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history that fully her [noise] I wouldn't be doing it can I get\nI I agree we we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the time\nThat somebody who really gets it\nWe come back we'll be Donald Trump junior here on the weekends finger [noise]\nRadio five eighty Ninety four point was whether increasingly [noise]\nMessaging ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

front of a paycheck\nSo few that had ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had their someone's family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean\nThat was the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming ... you know I remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\nNow now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation general hatred towards business and we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father is like I don't know why we couldn't have three\nThree and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and I quote there is no magic wand for that right now we have
