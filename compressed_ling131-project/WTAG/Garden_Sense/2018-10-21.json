{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Well you have to do just as much planning for the way up the mountain as we have to do for the way down the mountain so the way down the mountain is what we call ... preservation and distribution\nYou spend on strategy so you have to have a definitive plan\nBoth going up and coming down so\nIn one we create that planned for coming down\nWell you know we have to be thinking of that longevity peace so that we're not planning for the short term because if we're only planning for Fifteen Years well you know what happens if you're here Fifteen Years in one day or sixteen Seventeen Twenty years you know we don't want that to negatively\nImpact your ability to continue to live a lifestyle\n[noise] well I think to a you know on that no I'm at least again in my personal experience I've always sort of had this\n... Social Security so I'll take care of me and I'm sure a Medicare I'll be All right you know and I guess a lot of people are that way but when you really kind of peel the layers of the ... on the back you've got to take a closer look how\nAre you do because you know Social Security going to be enough for most people to live on and retirement\nProbably not I mean the you know we certainly have some clients and we certainly come across people who are able to live on a Social Security benefits alone\nBut you know what what happened was was you know they were pretty diligent savers and they lived a pretty simple lifestyle and for most people by the time you come into retirement you don't just adopt them ... lifestyle you continue to\nYou know you know they just their lifestyle was set up in such a way where you know they were able to but for most people\nYou know a Social Security is only going to replace maybe twenty thirty forty percent at the most of their\nWorking income so there's going to be a big gap that they're going to need to make up from their own savings or if they have a pension or whatever it is so\nFor the majority of folks you know then they probably are not going to be able to live off of just Social Security so from that standpoint you can think about it but when you're thinking about it that really ... the thought should be okay that's only going to be a component\nMaybe a third to half or whatever it is of what I'm actually going to need to generate in retirement\n[noise] okay uh some of the other threats we discussed\nThe last one will just discuss because I Want to get to a couple of questions here is a you know you talked about in in ...\nIn in what we really have to think about their as as the purchasing power of the dollar [noise] so I've I've got kind of a an example here so [noise] but she was Fifteen thousand does as an example today\nWell in ten years that Fifteen thousand is only going to have the purchasing power of about eleven thousand\nIn Fifteen Years about nine thousand twenty five years a little over eight thousand in Thirty years it's only going to have the purchasing power of about six thousand dollars a little over six thousand dollars so when you think about it that's why inflation\nHas to be a component that we're thinking of up front\nAnd yes a lot of people do model inflation into their retirement plans and they you know most people as a general rule will factor in a three percent inflation adjustment and that but\nYou know we find the fact of the matter is people don't typically adjust their income in that manner every single year just not the way that most people do it\nSo yes you you know we certainly want to be making an adjustment but the other piece that we have to be thinking of is that\nFolks almost have an automatic inflation adjusted built into their retirement income\nBecause of the fact of the matter is is when people retire most people within the first seven to ten maybe a little bit longer years of retirement\nThey're going to do the majority of the travelling or replacing cars or whatever helping kids or whatever it may be and then life has a natural tendency of slowing down so they almost have a built in inflation hedge in there\nBut again you know when we think about the the purchasing power declining significantly over the next ten Fifteen twenty plus years and people living that much longer and retirement\nYou're looking at a fifty plus percent loss of purchasing power and your dollar over that period of time so inflation is certainly something that you have to be mindful love because you're not going to be able to create a budget today and that budget is going to last you always for your time\nOkay from the ostrich with his head in the sand would doesn't Social Security bridge that gap somehow with cost of living well\nThey attempt to that but you know as people have experienced there's been gosh I don't know three or so out of the last ten plus years where it's been zero\nUh there's been one percent has been point three percent so we know what the averages are but the average is just they don't keep up with the cost of inflation and that's one of the the ah reforms that they're talking about is changing the cost of living adjustment within Social Security so\nYou know is it going to keep up with that I think next year I think they finally have settled on I think it's going to be to point ... percent I Believe don't quote me on it but I Believe that's what it's going to be set for two thousand and Nineteen so yes you know you may get some years where you're going to have a couple of percentage point increase\nBut that's just on the Social Security these you know and and most people who have it on Social Security pension they do have an inflation adjusted built into the pension but\nIt's not for one hundred percent of the pension amount in other words like my wife has a teacher for teachers pension you're only going to get a cost of living adjustment on the first Thirteen fourteen Fifteen thousand dollars or so of the pension and then whatever the remaining balances isn't adjusted for inflation so [noise]\nYou know it it's not going to be the full amount so unfortunately again revert back to the burden on each individual to be able to afford the inflation adjusted on their own\n[noise] thirty

the Washington Post contributor was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia maintains that happened during a fistfight a narrative Senate Democrat Dick Durbin ... believes\nCoaxed people come back to the king ah more rendition them ... and they don't really have a history of killing people\nIf he dies because of harsh interrogation techniques let's just say that's just something pretty serious it's not like they\nProbably just trying to question this takes that step further and where's the body one of these people that apparently went in how to boost\nAnd so that's why they think that he was dismembered and the president has made that Saudi Arabia one of our allies in that area the reports are that Jared Kushner is very close friends with the crown prince also and you know they're trying to open up the area to business and things like that so I don't know if it would put a halt to it but it would really severely impact what's going on there\nAnd it was extraordinary and I'm I'm I'm being told oh that like inside idea right if people are a bit frustrated with it because they're saying the Saudis have stayed with the United states has so many different things we cooperate with them on every level why should this one\nGuy this one incident got all that and there's no indication of the ... to by any means and the relationship what I mean it's not even I don't think any administration would not tell you that over and over this\nBut you have to remember it's not just any other opinion writer jealous I mean that's that is very prominent he knew people many many people in the U. S. foreign policy community he wrote for a very powerful newspaper and also you know frankly like when it comes down to it often when you have a single face\nOr single name that often captured the imagination of the public for more than when you say a thousand people were killed today in this war you know [laughter] so it becomes very emotional issue I Know members of Congress are very very upset about this on both sides I mean they're really mad\nAbout this and we're still waiting for any type of evidence they're saying that turkey might have a lot of evidence but they're not sharing any of it just yes and the elderly works\nOr not the most reliable married ... editor of everything and\nA lot of people are making something out of a show jeeze apple watch saying that he set it up to record and it went back to the cloud and to his iPhone which is fiance had and there might be some type of recording of what that interrogation sounded like\nThat the other theory on that is that tricky one story out there because they don't want to admit that they had this study for wired\n... foreign affairs correspondent for Politico thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\nThere has been a ton of developments since that interview that we did with in the hall that kind of sets up with the whole story is about after that Turkish officials were leaking all sorts of stories to the media part of it was they said they had audio recordings of what happened inside the Saudi consulate\nThey said that Mr ... was dead within minutes and within two hours\nAll of the killers are gone there said there was a Fifteen person\nHit team that went in there Miranda tell us what some of these gruesome details or because\nIt plays like a spy movie all this secret shady stuff happening in these political constantly it's you know it it's crazy the secrecy that happens in there that they think that they can get away with this kind of stuff what are some of these details of how they say he died\nYeah and like you said there were Fifteen people waiting for him for hours to show up and they knew what they were going to do they have this all planned out from the beginning and like you said he was dead within minutes they severed his fingers and cut his head off\nAnd asked they cut off his head and dismembered his body there was a doctor a forensic who had been brought along so that he could assist with the deception and the disposal of some of the body parts and he had some advice for them including one was to listen to music as he put his own headphones on because that's what he like\nTo do to try to ease the tension when quote doing such work\nThey said that he was dead within minutes but how quick and fast the torture was you know I'm assuming well and what were those minute flight right exactly I'm assuming some of those minutes were spent cutting fingers off or wants to cut off your head that's kind of not seeing the end of it but yeah for the doctor\nTo want to be wearing these headphones and listening to music just so drawn up the craziness of what's going on in front of you is just ridiculous\nThere are reports that one of the members of the Fifteen Percent assassin team world in there with the bones are right that is going to make some at gross noises exactly you don't want to hear\nThis is turning to just a mess on the diplomatic side\nThe United states is struggling with how to respond to this the world is crying out that Saudi Arabia and the crown princes directly involved in this the Trump Administration wants to tread very lightly they are an ally we do a lot of business with them they buy a lot of weapons from us in the billions of dollars\nAnd the president doesn't want to endanger that President Trump spoke to reporters and acknowledge that it certainly looks as though he's dead now what else did the president saying how what else is going on in the administration\nIn addition to his comments that quote certainly looks as though\nHer show jazz dead he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis are found to have murdered him and before he spoke\nTreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin pulled out of a major upcoming Saturday investment conference Mike Pompeo has been over there interviewing people trying to figure out what's gone on and he he'd been advised that the Saudis should be given a few more days to finish and make public they're credible investigation before\nThe U.S decides how or if they want to respond\nTo give them a few more days to think about how they want to cover this I'm ... I mean there's still a lot of evidence now they're releasing video surveillance of this Fifteen Percent hit teams walking in to the consulate walking out you know with a huge briefcase will get into some of those details in just a minute\nWe never saw ... like you know and\nHe never walked out himself this investment conference that's happening there and a Steven Mnuchin pulling out there's all sorts of companies that have pulled out just saying we can't do business with you until we know what's happening nobody wants to do business with killers\nAnd this is a major blow to them because at this point with the crown prince coming into power very soon they're portraying him as a reformer he's very good friends with Jared Kushner he's trying to open up the country to a lot of new investment and this was just totally uh throwing a wrench into it\nMight sound pales telling him you need to have a credible investigation and a credible answer to all this or you're not going to be a credible king when your time comes\nAnd it's important that you bring up that Jared Kushner connection because he's one of those people who's a top aide to President Trump he's been in President Trump's ear and we can kind of hear that conversation that they've had when President Trump spoke to the media on Thursday about what's going on with the investigation because\nSo to get more on this we spoke to surface or she is a media reporter frack CEOs and we started off by talking about how younger viewers are ditching traditional TV\nNow is that a lot of younger people who are still you can get it all variants it where they can hit on a show they\nOr they can watch it without commercials like make here is that they're getting with regular anyway that they're really outdated commercial and there you have to wait for something to go through all sell you can't\nAfford it anymore and they'd rather pay for either what are called like any Fonda also just keep our version is a lot he can also something like that like what's his take an where they can pay like ten dollars on line fourteen dollars a month and you're in\nA TV shows and movies that they can watch in fish at their leisure\nSome of these numbers are interesting sixty percent of young adults in the U.S said that the primary way they watch television is through these streaming services on the Internet by comparison only thirty one percent say they watch it'd be a cable or satellite subscription that's twice the number that are using their phones and tablets and other things like that to consume the media\nAnd I think that's a distinction can be made and we had found that in a piece for X. dot com which is that you have people who look at the fragmented ... it and they say hey they're waiting for the younger kids don't like to watch as much money as 'cause their noses in their fun read what they want\nIf any are video that they can turn them on their mobile shot with vertical orientation for\nKids et cetera that are in that people are saying look\nI Know the young kids level video that at the end of the day a young kid why watch came up on or a new TV show than watch game of Thrones on their own they want us to and their living room and meet on a screen\nWe have two different strategies you had this cat and then the grounds of the world are trying to really when he won your phone\nAnd then that bigger companies like the eight years that HBO you still want to own you on your regular TV\nLet's talk about some of the big players on mobile then let's talk about some of the big players on all this subscription stuff Snapchat and Instagram YouTube obviously one of the biggest one that's been a huge for years\nThat they knew player that hadn't launched yet but everyone talking about this one called ... which\nIs being launched found a bunch of Hollywood that meant that kind of like a cat and then the other ones that are more streaming so get the types of things that can eat with like Netflix or Hulu is one of the\nThings that might Disney and that's the kind of late next year it'll be family friendly and they want I think that's beginning to gain traction or that people are beginning to talk a lot about it is now and they're even had a snake box under thirty at stake because Disney five bucks\nAn hour and then that you already have it so that will be interesting to see how that one of the again who really far behind ... who has something like twenty million subscribers now like ... million\nNetflix came on the scene and they were doing a lot of movies and have now transitioned into all sorts of original programming TV shows and movies you're going to have choices all over the place and it's going to be tearing you away from the traditional TV cable bundle\nNo the other thing for an end or is that for really long time there was a reluctant for TV network that own their content and gave it to themselves they want I think there should be that far and wide\nOn Netflix and Amazon because they figure well we didn't need them all laid out with ... Seinfeld or alter the content off of this I read that notice all of your favorite Fox does I no longer on that right as a reason for that they want to make sure that the way that they can undermine that competition is like keeping their intellectual property\nHe thinks they're kind of ... that\nThat if you want to work you can only go to that and and you know while a lot of people think that content like game of Thrones Breaking Bad it's like ... the whole family get that little can you really want that content so I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of\nFamilies and that and by that\nIs really interesting and but there will be no shortage of things to watch now so it's going to be crazy how it'll shakes out sir Fisher media reporter for ... thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nDon't forget to join us of social media at daily diving pod on Twitter\nAnd do the puck is on the\nComment it was raining and tells the story that you're interested in [noise]\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts [noise]\nI'm also rumors and this is the daily died because [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is the daily dived weekend edition\nI'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week\nAnd don't forget to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without\nThe noise [laughter]\nI think one of the stories is captured everybody's attention this week is that oh the lottery the mega millions jak part is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who'd be the first person you'd call\nA ... I think I called my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been insanely wealthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the ... maybe that leftover generations\nThat's funny but we are that you're going to say something like hey no I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter] I I mean I might say that the experts say the first person you should be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of ...\nStuff that you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lotta times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million on for ... for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and then ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo told her ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer for us and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call the lawyer towards winning big I spoke to a uh Jason Carlin he's an attorney based in union New York he's actually a self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleventh\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protected them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money as such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is\nStill a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jak off of the mega millions was also\nPretty large so people the the question that I Will get most frequently is\nCan I claim my jackpot anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged us to file what's called the public record request and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on the statewide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the or an entity to claim the prize Ryan James carry his his name the director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine and you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could ... your name coming out because the the trustworthy L L C might get first building a there is only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write when they're gonna announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news the media starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you ah you know all the details because everybody wants to know so you know some experts have said close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but\nPeople that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that will tend to reach out to jackpot winners they all digital ... but then there are a lot they're bogus that's what they think Carlin the lottery lawyer was telling me is\nYou know you kinda have to keep it
