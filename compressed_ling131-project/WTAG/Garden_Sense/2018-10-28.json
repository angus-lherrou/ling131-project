{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Creating that planet and being aware of whether or not you can actually stay permanently unemployed and retirement\nIs a big component of a lot of people's plans and why again putting that plan in place sooner rather than later from a peace of mind factor is going to be critically important because you don't want to get to the last minute and say okay I'm going to retire only to find out [noise]\nGosh you know I'm not going to be able to retire how am I going to be able to generate another ten Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year I I Can't do it for my savings the only way I can do is go back to work so you you know you want to know and and be aware of those circumstances certainly before you all to make the decision to retire great\nThings to think about and are turning now to uh some of your questions and again we really appreciate the interaction from ah the retirement security audience or send men via the website my retirement security dot com or you can also phone um and and what's the number there\nJeff or they can find them in eight seven seven four to one six seven\nThere are a hero okay Dr what's up\nCut a ... this one is interesting ah you know what happened here is that the person had sent in our email then the question and unfortunately we didn't get to it on the show but they have since come into the office so able to address it what them personally\nAnd the reason being is that there was some time crunch in there so the question was can you withdraw funds from your pension before fifty nine and a half\nAnd avoid the early withdrawal penalty so in this particular person's case what we found out was they were offered a buyout package or you know early retirement type package\nBut she was only fifty eight years old\nSo the issue became okay well\nAre you going to completely retire and that's it and now you have to use whatever your buyout packages and you have to use your uh four one K. and pension money from that standpoint to start generating income\nOr you're just going to retire and take that money and invest it and then go find another job so that's where the the question came in because\nIf your\nIf your below fifty nine and a half\nWhat happens is is the IRS imposes a ten percent penalty on you if you want to draw from your tax qualified accounts so if you just take a straight out distribution as an example from your four one K. in this case when she was fifty eight years old\nOr maybe she takes her pension as a lump sum in roles that into an IRA and now she wants to take distributions prior to fifty nine and a half [noise]\nShe's got to be faced with a ten percent penalty that the IRS imposes that's just a straight rule\nThat says you don't know how to plan around it\nThere are different ways that you can plan around avoiding that ten percent penalty but you have to know how to structure things appropriately to do so so that's really the crux of of that answer is if you find yourself I guess\nAnd the fortunate position to be able to retire prior to fifty nine and a half\nThan you really need to understand the ramifications of what happens if you\nNeed to start drawing from your retirement savings because you have to structure those retirement savings and something that's called a Seventy you know it's an eye arrest coke seventies duty where in other words you're going to take substantially equal payments for\nYou know the longer of a five year period of time I want you to reach fifty nine and a half and that allows you to get access to some of those retirement funds and avoid paying the ten percent penalty so it has to be structured appropriately you know there are some other um hardship waivers and that sort of thing along the way but\nYou know again if if you run aware of how to properly do it and you just say oh I'm retiring and I'm going to take money out or you know that's why some people take loans out of their foreign case during their working years versus taking the distribution because you're going to get hit with that temper somehow\nYou know it's interesting I hadn't heard that fifty nine and a half figure\nFor I don't think you during the history me doing the show I don't think we've ever really talked about that and I remember when I first open to four O. one K. whenever that was Twenty years ago\nI remember thinking fifty nine and a half you know walk along you know it's a long way away and now fifty nine and a half seems to me like way early start thinking about retirement extremely early so how\nDo I mean you know that scenario just happen to be somebody looking uh for you know whether or not they should take the the early retirement package on would affect them\nAnd how it would affect them but yeah you know your points up and you certainly need to know those rules and then what's lingering out there so that if you did you know if you're in your mid fifties and you want to take some money out to do whatever well you know the more\nPower to if you can bailout that early so if it's going to be over for dinner [laughter] you got to be something let's lingering so you just want to be aware of that so uh the next one we want to get\nTo is a a this is a from a listener who attended one of the workshops and it was a pretty interesting question here [noise] um [noise] and you know thought we should kind of address it through the through the program because it may be a situation that is the ... into a lot of people um but\nRight now uh she's currently separated but not divorced from her husband and she's gonna fire and this is in regards to Social Security so she's going to file for her own benefits at her full retirement age which is coming up and just another month or so\nBut her benefit is very low and what she really wants to do was filed for spousal benefits but she can't\nBecause he's only sixty four right now still working and you know real intention of filing so really you know what her options are or she has to wait to file for a spouse or benefits once her spouse actually files or just take her own benefit from that standpoint\nBut here's the nuances and the Social Security rules and regulations is\nThere's a big difference between being separated and being divorced so that was kind of a follow up question that she had was okay well what if we are divorced what options you know does that open up and we certainly\nNot sitting here and being ... you know yeah you know or proponents of people doing one thing or another but\nTheir personal situation was just such where they've already were separated and then for one reason or another they just hadn't gone ... of of getting divorced so again or you know we're not saying\nYou know we ... that this is an angle because we're we're ... certainly not proponents of that\nBut in her particular situation she just needed to know and understand what the differences of the rules are and for her yes there there was a big difference because if she did ultimately filed for divorce and she was divorced\nNow she has the opportunity even though she has not yet filed on now there's an opportunity for her to start collecting a divorce spouse benefit\nSo there's a big difference in the rules between those two types of scenarios whether it's a marriage situation where you're looking to collect the spousal benefits or now under the current rules one spouse has to be collecting that benefit\nWhereas in a divorce situation if the divorce is more than two years ago one spouse just otherwise needs to be eligible for Social Security benefits for the other to start collecting a divorce spouse benefits so [noise] you know ... to pretty drastic\nDifferences between spousal benefits and those regard so you know you just again you know we're not proponents of telling people to go out and get divorced to try and you know do one thing or the other but you know if you happen to find yourself in that situation because you know a lotta times what happens is is people\nYou know that they may be living as separated but they're doing it for financial reasons because maybe the sharing and bills or whatever it is and it makes more sense for that particular situation but when you're looking at the longevity from a financial standpoint and you've got to look at the income peace\nWell he certainly got to know what the rules are\nOkay we're running out of time here at my big question is did she filed for divorce\nOr I don't know the gay budget\nMy job was to simply pass on the information and then from there that you know it's it's up to them but\nAgain all the more reason why you do to educate yourself so that you know what the rules are so that you can properly planned for whatever your circumstance\nAnd a good place to start that education my retirement security dot com that's disparate group website my retirement security dot com check it out especially the nesting report there's a lot of those a lot of similar cases streets in there he is attorney Jeff ... from Pittsburgh group I'm ... will do it for this edition we'll see you next time\nYou've been listening to retirement security with Jeff moms that from Memphis burn through [noise]\n\nThese news radio five eighty Ninety four forty niner fan double duty AG bent double duty HGH Worcester and I are ... radio station\nFortunately in that one was hurt that authorities are still unsure of why these bombs seemingly it to be structured similarly to I found it didn't go off and now the question is whether that was because of their intention to simply incite fear and not harm or if there was a technical fly that prevented it from going up\nAnd because of the similarities all the with the packaging and the actual devices themselves they do believe they're all connected\nOr we don't know if it's a single person or group of people but\nThey're all connected that way I Know experts have said that\nBecause the device has been knocked off there is a treasure trove of forensic clues that they can look at anything from DNA fingerprints and that's obviously where the investigation is starting I mean they're even looking at video when the packages first made it into the postal system as a you know everything is tracked by video when it starts in the postal system so\nThey're trying to like retroactively go back to see where it started and if there's any video of a person maybe dropping an offer something\nIt's almost like they're trying to start from the end of the construction at the device and worked their way back\nSo for now the packages hop either a rise are still things than to Quantico the lab and Virginia and what they're going to try to do is traced this as it as that could include DNA or fibers found on the package as friends on the back of the\nStand or on the pay they'll be getting this assembling these packages and attempt to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to try and see whether the constructor of beans seem a little tight bond whether they left them sort of stagnant or whether they lack some sort of air any\nWiring and maybe that was sort of their traits that there are a lot of quit that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle had at that\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape they each had like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very new details that got the ... the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of being lied explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X\nRays at the explicit than are examining as an are going through the ants wiring and the battery aunts and overall material that these are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... as you said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresentative Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and critics of the president the administration how was the president been responding\nThat President has largely been hunting blame offices and self in his rhetoric and back onto the media so that we thought different Trump rally\nFrom his normal show on Wednesday night it was absent from the lock her up chants while he was speaking are fake news ... says he points\nBack at the end of the ... criticizes the media and the crowd the wild it did however at that rally\nCalls for them ... the country he also tweeted on a Thursday again blaming the media for that he said that have very big part of the anger at at least in our society is caused by basically fake\nNews and that it's gotten so bad that it beyond description so what we see here is something very standard of the president ah these days says that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that impact and in the mid term that works you will embrace that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his easiest targets which is the media\nYeah it's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing I Know details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have sent these out thank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt's election season and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this here for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not TV it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so you said robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial media can dial more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls and robots ... these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can since thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left and the riot problems like open sesame for us old you know but that's my right hustle loaded on the on the left to send these tax than it is actually building a a platform to do that at scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we all know that people can go and they can call and they have political candidates often a\nCommon space with other people supporters so it's not entirely unlike that in terms of\nBeing another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rape of like about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is a red within five minutes and I mean I think that is in St Louis we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nSo much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging that any way to break through the voters is a big deal for campaign and\nThis is the daily died we can edition we'll be right back with more about personalized political text messages and how to get them to stop it high adopt\nThe daily dive weekend edition let's continue our conversation with David McCain heck reporter for Axios about personalized political text messages [laughter]\nRight I mean we're glued to our phones and you tend to open a text message you hear that little paying you tend to open it right away almost as you said within five minutes a lot of times we're kind of conditioned all ready to\nIgnore a robocall or ignore a call that comes in from a suspicious number or an email you kind of already can see by the headline or something that it's spam or something like that but with these text messages you're really unclear about what it is so you have to open it\nBroadly speaking the text message inbox is a ... ad heavy spot for many\nPeople not everybody but I think generally speaking we see that the messaging after made really popular with people and and they have not been monetize in the same way as opposed to Facebook or Twitter where people are now more used to ads in the feed and messaging will probably be ...\nYeah and since it's a a person to person thing I mean obviously they're kind of sending them and massing all but campaigns are hoping for that interaction maybe it is something you're interested in you text back and you say hey where is that rally going to be or what's going on then it opens that line of communication and the campaign can interact directly with those voters\nI mean if it's raining and tell us the stories that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts mosque rumors and this is the daily diet and weaken the [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors were running down some of the top stories of the week don't get to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] for the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the\nCentral American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant care of and we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked tough on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think\nThe one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know under us El Salvador Guatemala\nThey're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there are so you know some military guys they put up a road blockade at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't going to be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting aid I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in turn Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and and and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere and four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't\nWant to do that on his own and these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give and Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the terms you know he's saying\nWhenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything to keep the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms and everything and he provides a little covered by being forceful but is\nThere not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now and only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think it is an issue that is really important to Republican voters and it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and less so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now\nWhether any of these proposals you know border wall flashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them\nThey really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House suppose the bills that had the most support so it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that the U.S Canada and Mexico work out some funding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce this type of migration\nThe presidents of the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly\nTo talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations and in some cases those are economic limitations of not having the funding to do it and that's I mentioned before with us funding is being cut towards and he's got a project so Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean I'm Doris in particular is an example where I'm the president there one Orlando Hernandez is a strong us ally but one\nNarrow reelection and it doesn't really have much of a mandate\nTo govern you definitely have different situations in each country in different capacities as to how they're able to address this\nTen has an immigration reporter for Politico thank you very much for joining us", "show_name": "Garden Sense", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "28"}
