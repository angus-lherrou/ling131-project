particular strategy is this is how much you can really quantify and look at those different scenarios to see really whether or not one way is that much more beneficial to you than another\nNow when when you're doing this I'm ... and you're looking at a a potential clients health or I hate to say it but wait or if he's a smoker I mean do all those things come into play\nI Do absolutely so you know we're constantly having those discussions with our clients and again you're having that discussion as of today and life just has a tendency of sneaking up on us so sometimes we can be planning one particular scenarios today because\nEveryone's healthy everyone's feeling good and then next thing you know six months a year later someone has a cancer scare or some other issue pops up and they say hey you know what\nEven know if things are looking good the outlook is looking good and you know this has really changed my focus so the new okay well then we you know re evaluate the plan and we make some adjustments if needed in in terms of one to apply so\nHowever the planning process goes and however we're looking at it [noise] we have to have that flexibility built in\nTo say okay well this may be the way that we're focusing on and this way may be the way that we're projecting that we're going to start plugging these pieces in the place but I guess what\nIf things happen along the way and we hit a road bomb okay do we have that flexibility can we fall back to plan B because you really need to have a plan a plan B in place so that way you know\nOkay if I don't work you know a lot of people come in and they'll say yeah you know what\nI'm feeling pretty good I'm sixty two sixty three and I certainly can work to Seventy I fully enjoy what I Do but I Can't tell you how many times a couple of years later now they come in sixty five or sixty six and they're like hey you know [laughter] you know it's not you know I'm not it's\nDoing it as much as I was a couple of years ago or you know a lot of times in today's day and age you know they've been working for what felt like a kind of a family business and you know everyone got along real bright and hey now there's this new regime in town and they're not operating it as a family business anymore and it's just not\nEnjoyable to get up every day and go to work and hey you know what I don't think we should be planning on age Seventy anymore maybe it's age sixty eight sixty seven or whatever it may be so you know that that's why we have to have that flexibility built in to be able to know okay\nWe can project out these different points in time and kind of plan for the worst and hope for the best type scenario so that\nWhen we get those ah you know comments from clients and we have\nThem wanting to re evaluate the plan that you know we've already done that homework to be able to tell them right then and there hey yeah you know what at sixty six yes you can do it you can't afford to retire then or hey you know what this is way it'd be at sixty six but if you can make it another year you're going to be even in a better position\nAt best possible scenario you know one of the other things to say speaking from personal experience and yes I'm right I'm right in your crosshairs as far as you know retirement age\nUm is unfortunately and not to get more of it but looking at the obituaries every day I mean you know more and more folks in my age group and my peers will suddenly\nFor whatever reason just passed away in at a you know you your own mortality I think you become much more acute\nUh with the passing years so I think that plays into it to a little bit sharper absolutely so ah is so what kind of wrapping up our whole discussion here on Social Security or any other nuggets are one thing I think I Want to bring forward is uh that fact that\nYou brought up many times about once you start taking your Social Security benefits\n... ... you know on average how long is it before you've actually gotten back and benefits what you put in over the working your\nStress so that statistics zip as you know I'm not pulling these numbers out of there but that statistic is released every year uh through the office of the actual when they come out with that trust fund report\nSo that statistic currently is around five years so in other words it's going to take the average a retiree approximately five years to get back out of the system what they themselves have contributed into the system so\nThat's another key point because some people come in and they'll sit down at the workshops and you know before we kinda get into everything they're really dejected and thinking gee I'm not going to get anything that says there's no value here you know they're probably gonna cut my benefit away\nAnd then once we start showing them that value and once we start going through some of these statistics you know you can kind of see a little sense of relief in some aspect from them when they say okay well here are even under these current long term projections\nI'm going to be way beyond that five year point I'm going to be into my eighties and nineties before they're potentially as any reduction in my Social Security benefits so that's why ah earlier on the show I said for baby boomers that their benefits and not likely to be affected by reform\nBecause those benefits projections the long term projections of when benefits may potentially be reduced\nTheir way off in the future for a lot of retirees today\nFinally bank error and our favorite X ray I'm you know and and that's another thing too I think that in general a ... a much like you know planning you know life insurance and final expenses and things like that\nUm when you really are facing retirement and crossing that threshold um I don't want to say they're tough questions but it there's a a reality factor kinda kicks in and and to try to\nUh you know for see all these things that could happen and without you know getting the for voting you know dejected look that sometimes you see at the beginning some of your workshops um you know you just kind of have to take action really sharp you know\nYeah I mean it was funny we stuck into someone after the workshop the other night and [noise] and he happened to be a state worker so he's going to be subject to the ... nation provision but his his opening comments to me when he was going to ask a question\nThey asked me if I had a far back as\nI got it you know in terms of what his individual situation is going to be in regards to the Social Security is so so it's kind of a don't shoot the messenger a type scenario but again it just goes to show that\nYou know you can have an idea of what the potential ramifications are but until you educate yourself on what the actual impacts are going to be for your particular scenario\nYou really aren't going to know and are you going to feel better by having that information beforehand rather than potentially be planning around benefit amounts that you're actually not going to receive because you didn't know the full impact them it's quite it's quite helpful to to do the homework at it\nAnd once again that's where a the disparate groups are free workshops really come in handy and again I Can't stress enough these are educational they're free or has there is no sales pitch involved and there are still a couple of uh availability for the Thursday night ...\nCorrect so the last workshop that we have availability for is this coming Thursday October eleventh six

getting new meaning to the mid term elections the November vote largely viewed as a referendum on President Trump's first two years in office who also reflect this struggle surrounding the future of the Supreme Court\nThe time of mixing there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it which they called the decision information distribution system the ... device and what this was is it something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick in the seventies\nBasically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warning set from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody'd be watching the same program informing you of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their homes\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to bust your phone\nWhenever he wants to just to clarify if not the president's sitting in his office and saying I'm going to say now this alert no ... there was a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's gonna be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how they use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nIn the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so I didn't talk was half forgot about that there's a long strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda think he wants to go and\nYou're listening to the daily diving weekend edition I'm Oscar remembers and we'll be right back

daily dive weekend edition\nNext step is my favorite story of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies it takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story\nHe won the lottery hit it big one Nineteen million dollars and then blew through all of it he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nSanta Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was this peachy cruiser ban that it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him the P. T. crews are bad at it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the bags to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking her who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim Hayes\nOh Jim have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one night the million dollar and the California state lottery and then\nOver the course of the next decade sort of amazingly and managed\nTo lose it all and then after losing it all came out\nPretty accessible bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he wouldn't then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking for ten years in prison now and writing letter so he kinda ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had gotten her pour his lawyer then told me you know I\n... going to be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story so why don't you send him a letter in prison and a clean up for it he had already pled guilty I think it was waiting for\nSentencing hearing at the point that eye contact with him so he basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been sentenced in case anything and the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nHey I Am fascinated by what I've read about you know I Want to know more can we talk can we can we had to be pen pals and ... and then I send them all that stuff like five or six questions from whom I get back and he brought me back\nTo the play really amazingly like up paying letter with\nLike a really good sense of humor and like a lot a lot of exclamation points just not what I expected at all like in terms of tone right so I was like oh man now I'm even more fascinated by it because they don't seem to be\nFound out about the fact that now you're doing ... almost ... years in federal prison it kind of had this happy go lucky even now kind of attitude which\nAfter everything you've been through ... well let's start with some of the good stuff and so he won Nineteen million dollars in the lottery I was actually Thirteen point seven million wants taxes were taken out a climate of its own so you got a shortage about five million dollars out of that\nHe said that the port Taylor was right at a central casting she looked like a librarian and was terrified and it's that where do you never forget your first and that was his first\nRussian thrill and it worked and he started doing research to keep it going to be obviously had a drug problem with that point he went from pain killers to heroin and he needed to feed that habit and this is what he was doing and he had a pretty good success he hit nine out of ten banks\nTen out of eleven but still he with honor roll and all of it you have to kind of remember this is on the heels of ... not long after\nHe got hooked on pain pills the condo that he was managing completely burnt down and he lost all of his possessions [noise] so it's kind of weird which from oh hey I have so much good luck in my life\nYou everything is going wrong I'm now I have\nI'm addicted to heroin and I can't have\nAccess to the money that I have to get so easily every year he's kind of feeling sorry for himself that way and it's not hard for him to justify and then his brain thank victimless crime rare that you know he doesn't hurt anyone he doesn't have a gun\nAnd he was never violent with anybody he never even had a gun he told people he did but he never had one so I mean I think that helped later on dissent in saying\nThey called them the P. T. crews are banned it and I I live in the LA area so I remember this a couple of years ago when this was going on seeing it in the news and following his bank robbers have always fascinated me so he bought that the tea crews are with the money that he had been stealing and that was his getaway car how did have the FBI\nActually catch him like when did things turn I Know\nOne of the things was a huge mistake he hit the same bank twice\nOnce successfully and then he is kicking himself for this now but then went back not too long later hit the same bag but I tell her recognize him that were there before\nSo he fled without any money at that point and the lead investigator who kind of starting to get on there and at that point said All right he gets failed I Know he's going to hit again and I know from that now that I've gone out that I have\nA pretty good hunch that he located all along with same thoroughfare because here where all the thing that connects all these bank so after\nThat failed robbery and they set up\nA camera along a highway and basically we're just looking for that knowing that he was probably going to strike and knowing what his vehicle was set it up and then we'll\nWin and evidently he hit again and I don't think it it wasn't too much later in terms of the timeline and it was definitely less than a month and knowing that he hit again just think that up with Ryan line and when the bank had occurred and then went through the camera footage they got a\nA help from a tip you know the bust at his house was very dramatic is walking out of the garage and they wanted him with a arts if teams and clock pistols and got him in boom that he was arrested in it'd be sentenced to thirty three months in prison three years of supervised release after that you know when he would get out\nAnd he had to pay back the money in restitution his release date is February twenty third twenty twenty so he still has a little bit of time in there what does he been doing with his time there and what are his plans after he gets released\nHe's been making art in prison in trying every letter that he sent me had like some sort of elaborate picture on it like one hadn't Garfield on that he was a cat\nOh you have some of those on Twitter or something I've been you know people get\nHe wants to publish a book at the end of this right\nHe's working on a on a book I Know that he's like playing softball Ethan exercising and that is kind of like tapped into his horse ... side he has a funny like a ... view of all of it now and they said like look I'm clean and sober now yeah kind of like fourth day talks\nFor the better he even said himself that it helped him more so than the money ever did and that's what I mean I Love the stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest of highs to being so desperate that you have to turn to a bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it now do we O'Neill contributor for

medicine physiology or medicine that went to two people Dr James Alison and to a Sudoku on Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs immuno therapy quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to\nLoft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who were these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ... both of them of specialized\nImmunology studying the body's immune system this turned out to be a critical part of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective and are effective in certain situations but\nThey can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells in the body along with cancer cells and so that causes that causes all sorts of complications going back about Fifteen Twenty years\nThere was another advance in cancer treatment and that was
