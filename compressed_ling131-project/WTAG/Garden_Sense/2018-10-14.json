{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "So in in general for the planning models we use a three percent inflation an annual inflation adjusted\nAnnual ... is that Fifteen Percent over five years was correct which is which is pretty significant really\nIt is but again when you think about it you know are the costs of goods and services going to be\nThat much cheaper than they are today are they going to continue on uh the trend as they are so\nEverything that we want to do everything that we consume a all over extra curricular activities entertainment everything like that automobiles those sorts of things they ... they're going to be chugging along with it as well so what might seem like\nA big number in reality isn't going to be a that much because you you need is you know the cost of living that's going along and\nWhen you think about from Social Security well you know the odds are you may not be getting a cost of living adjustment that's adequate with your Social Security so yes you may have to rely on more of your savings for that inflation\nAdjusted historically speaking I'm there has been a cost of living adjustment was Social Security when in again in general what does that usually\nWell I mean it it's tough to say it averages out maybe around two and a half percent little over two and a half percent or so but annually annually but for retirees who have been collecting Social Security as an example uh three out of the last ten years it's been zero\nHas been a point three percent a year or one percent year so you know we can say on average it's been a little over two and a half percent annually but\nYou know you get the eight percent and you get to zero percent all averages out but you know what happens when you get those zero years in terms of your cost of living adjustment and Social Security and you need a little bit more income now you're relying on your own retirement savings for that inflation\nAdjustment a and you know once again those are good friend Uncle Sam arrive at that you know why would there be as zero\nYear well because it's all based off of the economy and how the economy is growing and so they're looking at all these different segments in components of the economy\nTo gauge where's inflation moving from that standpoint to see how much are we going to adjust the cost of living so there is a a formula and there are indexes that they look at you know in regards to the economy so it's not just\nWilling you know in an arbitrary type of thing that they do but again it you know whether or not it's going to be a true cost of living adjustment is is a completely different animal\nAgain I think ah you know kind of goes back to what we talked about earlier in the show today is er during your working years that's how sort of figure it out for you as you've got your head down and your truck in a way to work every day and then suddenly when you become fixed income\nAll you know the smallest increments make a huge difference especially you know person it out over several years\nRight I I think it equates zip like anything else um that's relative to you personally that's when all of a sudden how is it affecting me today okay now I ...\nThey have to start paying attention to her versus\nFor me as an example and I'm forty four and you're almost sixty five so yes it's going to be more important to you to kind of figure out the significance of Social Security and how those adjustments are going to be made because you're going to be closer it's going to be impacting you now for me\nI you know it's it's useless for me to concern myself at you know because it's going to be so different for me in Twenty years when I'm potentially going to be thinking about it\nSo it's not going to impact me so I'm not going to pay much attention to those different uh pieces of it but\nYou know it's it's just the way that the world works I Believe in you know until you know yes you have some people who are advocates for a surge in particular a circumstance and they're going to be advocates lifelong advocates from that situation\nBut for most people yeah they may be paying some attention to it but it's not until they get closer to the time or it's directly going to impact them that they're going to start paying attention and figuring out okay and you know what do I have to do or you know what are those inflation adjustments how they'd been or\nIn a war of ... what am I available a you know in terms of resources and one of the benefits and what are the Medicaid Medicare plans and all these different things that\nWe did have to think about because we were getting health insurance from our employer or we didn't think about much in in regards to retirement accounts because we were just telling our employer hey listen\nHave seven ten percent whatever it is withheld from my income direct deposit it into my retirement our and yeah and that's it you weren't thinking about it now the focus becomes okay this is what I have\nAnd I'm not working anymore I'm not contributing to these accounts anymore and now I really have to focus in on how this nest egg is going to supplement me\nFor retirement and not only that they're going to tell you when you got to take it out and how much tax they're going to take out of it which is something that for whatever reason I just\nI knew there were there were taxes involved and retired but it it I just always had this perception that for some reason they go easy on the old folks which is just not true\nNo it's not because from that standpoint you know the simple question to ask you saw that a lot of people get caught off guard and they say well okay I Want to be in a much better position when I retire because I'm going to be in a lower tax bracket and that sort of thing but guess what that's not always the case and for the vast majority of people that's not always the case because\nHey you're not going to have any of the actions that you've been taking all along for the most part no more dependence and mortgage interest and everything else\nAnd be they keep changing the tax laws on so if you think taxes are going to be higher or lower than they are today in the future so all those things combined you know we certainly have to be paying attention to the tax implications as well\nOkay we're starting to run a short on time Arab we got a case history you want to talk about or\nMaybe it will carry that over because I just want to mention the last couple a component so we can kind of get through this so\nWe talked about income we talked about inflation the next one is to have an adequate emergency fund that is critically important so you want to have some funds segregated so that if you do have a those unexpected happened you have a place to go to so you want to have a plan around that\nYou want to be thinking of income for the surviving spouse that's another another critical components often overlooked in regards to Social Security planning that we pay attention to\nA long term care planning what happens God Forbid if you have a long term care need hardy of first and foremost protect yourself\nHow to protect a spouse at home if you're married significant other highly potentially protect that legacy that you want to pass on that that is an absolute critical component that we have to be at least talking about up front\nAnd then the last thing I just want to mention real quickly is having a properly designed a state plan\nBecause we can talk about having in creating your financial plan\nBut having and equally comprehensive estate plant is just as critical because if we need to be addressing care needs if we need to be addressing the distribution of your assets and how you want to control the distribution of your assets upon death\nWell we have to have both legal and financial plan more importantly we have to make sure the both of those plants are going to work together\nI mean it seems like there's an awful lot of planning goes into resting and peace and uh I've\nBeen to some good stuff really great to thought starters or this week Jeff as always maybe next week to week into those last couple of things we talked about being touch back on them in a dig into them a little bit more as far as a long term health care 'cause I Know you've said in the past that\nIt doesn't always make sense for you to carry high premium\nAround you know massive you know we're we're all of your health care is taking care of ... not in every situation so\nWere worth discussing once again the disparate group ... my retirement security dot com check it out especially the nest egg report because of the dresses all of the topics that we talk about to each and every week here including\nA lot of the stuff we discuss today and we'll see the next time around for attorney Jeff ... and the rest of his colleagues at the ... will talk to him next week you've been listening to retirement security with Jeff moms that from this bird group [noise]\n\nCall eight seven seven forty one six seven hundred or visit my retirement security dot com that's eight seven seven

stronger or expected to seem more high end hurt\nSo you might have you or hurricane season but a bigger percentage of them is going to be a cap for five now that matters a lot because the the cat for ... five storms because most of the ...\nWith both Florence and with the current storm you had both storms go through periods of rapid intensification that mean that it intensified by about thirty five miles an hour or greater in twenty four hours this far exceeded\nThat baseline definition of what we think we made\nIt and I say we meaning the climate community and as somebody who covers the community I Am I'm a way but really\nIt's the scientists who are doing the work and they're saying to me we think we might be seeing a trend towards more frequent rapid and I'm a kitchen that's a real forecast challenge because if that's going to be happening more frequently you could go to sleep\nThinking you're going to get hit by a category one and wake up\nThe hit by a category for a real nightmare with this storm\nAndrew Freedman science editor for Axios extreme weather expert thank you for joining us thank you for having me\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOne of the other huge stories of the week was this surreal moment in the Trump Administration when rapper Kanye West went to the oval office he had a meeting with the president\nAnd in true ... fashion he just had this dream of consciousness rent it provided a lot of lives a lot of question marks nobody knew what he was going for sometimes Miranda you're a big fan of ... yes what did you think of it\nI have not yet and brought myself to watch the full video ready because I still want to continue being a fan of panic [laughter] he's made it very challenging because I don't often agree with President Trump he talked about the hat\nAnd how was the Superman Cape for him we actually have a little portion of that let's play ... at the oval office uh\nI think it's the way that helps you to day life you know they try to scare me to not where this had my own friends but this has it gives me it gives me the power in a way it was so to put\nOff it made me feel like Superman made from it was hot and humid for ... for me also got a list\nOf Arab guy nonpolitical\nKnowing what's going to be on it how we want to do it by the way and just go ahead and get it done\nThe president just smiling politely at the end he said hey you know what that was very impressive\nAnd you know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost he feels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia ... she's a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when ... was there with the president's a we spoke to her about her impressions of that\nAnd then she was also part of a bigger story that happened early in the week she had a private press conference with the president\nMike Pence Mike Pompeo chief of staff John Kelly and that also was another surreal moment it was the closest thing you'd ever get to being a fly on the wall so when we come back from the break we'll get into the full interview with Olivia new to this is the daily dive weekend edition [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] we'll come back to the daily died weekend edition but jumping tore interview with Olivia knew the she's Washington correspondent for New York magazine we're talking about the interview with President Trump but we started off with the whole ... story and asking why he was there in the first place\n[laughter] little ostensibly\nHe was there to talk about criminal justice reform remember his life Kamkar dashing less influence the president back in early June to commute the sentence for a woman who had been in prison since like Nineteen Ninety six on a drug charge\nAnd the president did that and I got a lot of positive press for that you have that\nKind of one of these rare non controversial good things that he did and I think that he is acceptable to ... months good press and that's probably cynically part of why he want to continue doing this sort of thing and his son in law Jared Kushner who's the top White House advisor that's made criminal justice reform wanted his\nCentral issues and so it gets reported earlier this week that Congress should be coming in to speak to the president and that was like main topic that they were supposed to be covering but horse ... has been out there very controversial early very openly supporting Donald Trump over the last month\nAnd booth recently on ESPN Now wearing a make\nAmerica great again hat wearing it everywhere and he was wearing it today and it it's really funny in the oval office I just kept thinking\nThis is so unusual because a Donald Trump is not the most puzzling figure sitting here in the oval office today he rode out the most talkative person in the oval office if it's sort of a monologue from Kanye West he was also not the one marrying the make America great again hat so it's very weird\nIt was so interesting watching the video because the president sitting behind a desk and he has his hands class and he's just looking at ... go off yeah president was just like quietly nodding his head like you said\nShe was a stray and yeah you have the more outlandish character in their ... just went off and it was very much like the ... of passwords stream of consciousness and he's just going on and and he\nSort of out Trump yeah from and I mean the president speaks that way too though where he speaks in the stream of consciousness he touches on all different topics I mean I had as you mentioned before firsthand experience with that earlier this week with a lot of it\nBut I had a better view of the president whereas standing in the oval and I get a con game but I I could see them both and it was just so interesting to watch\nSet up and yeah\nAnd he kept saying you know look I'm so happy we could all be here we didn't plan that the main thing is that and you know I'm not like a detective but when someone says that over and over it kind of things like that up\nI have two more questions about this surreal experience one\nDid you notice any type of chaos as you said it's ... times it seemed like this was kind of coordinated almost um and you know his interactions with chief of staff John Kelly and all the other players in did you get a sense of there's some craziness going on or did everybody just seem to get along even\nSo for step the end that that would be walking out sheet of staff John Kelly and Mick air somebody who I did to reporting on because I heard that he was a possible replacement for John Kelly had been offered John Kelly's job they hug each other and they called out to me and I turn\nYou around the eight and ... and they were like they basically I think John Kelly that this is my friends to Nick airs that and he's mind\nI Would never imagined General John Kelly hugging another guy like that or you know making the display hey we're buddies you know that's what I mean\nIt was just so theatrical and strange but I it was so awkward and anytime I think you have an outsider like a reporter in the next it's probably you know the performance but in this case it really really felt like a performance\nThen everybody had been ... at that\nAnd everyone still get French all to the pet him which I think\nThat's been any president by the way that it works with Trump is probably get for it I mean he asked John Kelly he said well do you think of the president and and the third person and John Kelly said he'd like very great or something like that you know as if he wasn't just speaking to you the president right it was just weird the whole thing that we're\nIn the in the last question I have for you 'cause we spoke about Kanye and kind of a stream of consciousness thing and just kind of how he's all over the place\nThe president in speeches and everything I meet at rallies he displays some of those same type of things so how is it sitting in the room trying to ask them questions and him just interrupting jumping all over the place how do you wrap your head around that\nIn real time I didn't find it to be difficult but when I was confronted with how to liking David ... her\nI just thought it would almost be a misrepresentation\nTo try to can can any of his clothes\nAnd make them easier to digest are more focused because that's just how he talks he did not speak in a clear and concise way and I think ... if he is never taken out of context\nAnd I don't mean that at like an insult your reporter is the way that people say taking a contract that anytime that hits close are chopped up so that they can be clearer I think it\nKind of an accurate in LA and I find it very interesting I was on CNN last night and a Republican operative who was on with me on the air she said that she had been at dinner earlier that night and somebody who was in my piece that she wouldn't say who but it's a small group of people she bumped into him at dinner and he said that the White House but\nReally cleats my piece and they really liked it and it kind of it's very fair and quote the opposite of fake news\nYou know and I left I didn't do anything because\nIt it's not the night the heat in the world but I think that\nTrump is probably satisfied\nYou see his quotations printed in fall I think he would the times that he feels depressed as being unfair is probably a lot of the time when it's cold it's chopped up and ... people try to interpret what he's saying rather than just\nPutting it out there and so I'm sure people are going to give me some shit about pushing a full transcript basically of what he said but I think that's\nJust the only way to really understand what he was saying\nI agree with you completely the article is great it's the closest thing to being a fly on the wall in the room thing to to just kind of see what's going on you know and\nAnd as you say it's time to ... might have seen like a production or whatever but you know that's the way it seems like it goes in there and and I love the way you wrote it out ... as it happened chronologically as you said\nThe times he interrupted you it was just amazing so I had a great job on that piece and you know it's just great that you were able to be there for these two big moments or just this week uh Olivia knew the Washington correspondent for New York magazine thank you very much for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nDon't forget to join us on social media daily diets pod on Twitter and anytime caps on the [noise] the comic it was raining and tells the story that your interest [noise]\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts by moslem heirs and this is the daily died in the [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] this was the daily dive weekend edition time Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nOne of the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space X and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIs the only link that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nWas the flight was this other woman astronaut when USS not one cause ... the space station there in the Soyuz spacecraft which also writes about Iraq and the same name\nThat was going up or they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the\nSpace station to we're going to come back though the space station always has the story was capsule attached up there just in case so that's or get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official seal of approval on that for coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew\nOr not it didn't\nSo apparently what happened is made it through about two minutes of flight ... staging per se the second stage or what I can tell if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally up of drugs they drink but it's been a long time since I've looked at the pills or there might have been something going on with\nWhat are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either the engine built to admit it or what I've read more recently is that the first stage the drug free properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nOther rockets designed to be able to do that or they all have been since the early space food woke on our side than the ... the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Garden Sense", "city": "Worcester", "day": "14"}
