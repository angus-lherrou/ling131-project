changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think\nSome of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil cases are good men was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official word a confirmed that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to\nGo after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg ...\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I ... and\nAnd yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton\nRussia collusion she had on her payroll British spy a who is using Russian sources and now we've learned through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed to him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nA shoe you know this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated a federal regulations are very clear you may not submit the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated and yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and specter general has a has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant you know the basis of bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the unverified\nAre uncorroborated dot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those that I mean that was and he has to be held accountable for that well\nLet's wait and see when the documents that declassified but the answer to your question does of course\nUh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated\nBut I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing and it doesn't have to be one or they did not necessarily linked\nWould they would he have an obligation did this is what frustrates me I think that the the mandate was so broad that we ended up going into people's you know main bank loan applications from years gone by to me is just ridiculous the considering where it was supposed to start and where it was supposed to go\nUh what do not lead to an important issue especially of Russian lives were paid for and disseminated to the American people to purposely lied to them before an election and worse than that used to use them five by the applications to spy on an opposition party candidate and then use later to destroy a presidential\nUh a president who was duly elected\nWell a hundred percent and if those things are verified the people involved should be held responsible criminally but I'm saying that the bowler investigation of itself\nCan conclude by showing the president didn't do anything wrong one of the dangers of a special counselor or a special prosecutor is they have only one case so they're on a mission\nBusinesses expect in today's hiring market which has changed a lot in the last two years\nWill Sean this spring was the first time in nearly Twenty years at the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people with this we're seeing some creative benefits being offered to alert top talent\nAnd what can job seekers look for in this market\nWhere we did a survey of our franchise owners in film a top for ... in attracting and retaining workers were wages in bonuses naturally family benefits education in training in workplace culture\nWhat about business owners or managers can you share examples of some of these initiatives\nBusinesses or expanding leave and benefit policies to include elder care and offering flexibility to address things such as child care and transportation also wages are increasing as well including raises in sign on bonuses\nSo it really sounds like a job seekers market right now what else can you share\nCompanies are looking for ways to offer growth and development within the business versus having employees seek advancement opportunities elsewhere and this could mean offering training and educational systems not just for the job there isn't but for a future career auction\nMakes sense invest in your workforce and they'll invest in your business\nThat's right Sean and an investment isn't always financial from a simple insincere thank you to a recognition program to celebrate employees now is the time to express appreciation for a job well done and if you need help

and express employment professionals as you support the growth of business and provide many job opportunities\nThank you Sean [noise] have you\nAs we can bring Garrett and John sale and All right so Rod Rosenstein why would even be\nIn the mix considering we now know and have ... Greg Jared that he was saying you know ... what do you want me to wear a wire around the president\nWell he has a lot to answer for and the president I'm sure I spoke to him about it on air force one today did did you really try to get people to secretly record may ... ... did you recruit people\nTo invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment to me from office now we know Rosenstein is going to not to deny it whenever he's caught a engaging in illicit if not illegal activity she claims his words were\nMisinterpreted over and over again we've seen examples of that a threat to the intelligence committee staff threats to Devon newness\nOh I'm just misunderstood Rosenstein must be the most misunderstood man in Washington DC but it would be imprudent politically for the president\nTo fire him he has no intention of doing show son\nYou know must receive Mueller's report and I think the president wants to see how that will play out and I think it's beginning to wind down many of the people on Miller's staff of already left and returned their jobs at the department of justice so I I think that is reaching a conclusion I agree with John\nNo collusion no structure and a and then let's launch a serious\nInvestigation with a grand jury and the people at the department of justice and the FBI\nWho engaged in this what I Believe to be an illicit illegal scheme to frame Donald Trump\nWill take a break here but we got to say goodbye to Greg\nJared John Sayles thank you both for being with us eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number this was going to be a huge story\nAnd it's
