Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed\nThese voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans are

now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but off your ...\nAnd you can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs that I'm going to leave the house which right there is a lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate

think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were common old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while they are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nGet a white ... ... ... ... ... that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time after them that the cause of what she's\nBeen taught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the one hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine\nHook up at a ride by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like\nThat isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women women on

I I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people um it it could take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat is now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible part is an organization you know it it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo hear your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYet it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on that that\nJudge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to\nBe watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but I but it\nUp you know the parents who bought a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning and the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself\nPrior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that\nBut for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your habits very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them there's what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave instructing page but\nThe FBI is is ... ... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn\nGeneral Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talked to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look hit companies coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to live the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're\nGetting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't as it is how much they kept force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nDon't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my prediction\nUndemocratic IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer

said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I mean ... or even count as a credible allegation but you know what\nGo for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to make a whole new ones and they don't make any recommendations they're just going to give very handover the

and none of the fork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey we really can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so

things that people want to block now but um [noise] in any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation\nNumber one for so where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect but there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witnesses being coaxed July\nPeople being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the problems we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita Roberts FBI investigation\nThey don't want any of these things because it's not

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of the third grade meant what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not and he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is an expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway as senator Hirono now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar and so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff lakes going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nWe're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the way he was treated\nAt the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump with say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain well\nI mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state ... state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that I doubt\nIf they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and\nSeventeen would create a patient registry for researchers cancer and LS had a message researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease for more information on this bipartisan bill visit I save team dot org that's eyes save team\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG\nNewsroom ...

I I I saw him getting rent fellow cops to quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch that when the malls or the bunch comparison [laughter]\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by by their friends who remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that and we have we haven't heard from us friends so I'm asking why they're people alive today I had a party and there are people that know about that time he's\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall that Julie sweating it another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute ... how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago it would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic\nParty culture where almost every week at that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite while this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does that how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been writing is a lot of columns about this not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she is now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on this going to be the thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds\nA war on on the basis of their lack of evidence and uh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a but due to the news networks are saying about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this problem or a good correct or at least where you can see what I think where it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just wasn't nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one hit the writer who she was on the other was deceased and good answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker or the New York times couldn't print the story and and they

I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but\nThese numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nAll that it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap does as closed almost two dead even halt and you see Republicans and important Senate races now a dead heat\nIn all of the states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans\nAnd there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me\nI just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever a division of nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor before there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything forensic league that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe that they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about having a Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful um he he makes comments like that\nI mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many camps\nAims are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience what this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat and if our side does show up in both\nI think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush\nTo oil behind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they are either going to seek ... happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\n[noise]\n\nThe house Newt Gingrich now I I Will say this if we allow this to get rewarded and they get power as a result of this or what but we're not going to know till Saturday of impact judge Kavanaugh is confirmed and\nYou know I I Hope Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are satisfied I Know who Susan Collins so she was satisfied with the FBI report and Jeff Flake said the same thing I don't know where Lisa Murkowski is he has not spoken publicly as of now but I Hope we don't reward this behavior because if we do\nTo me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this\nAnd anybody that the Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing slandering that goes on and I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show and this is the absence of malice how do you proven absence of malice\nIt's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach\nWhich is why people like you and me whatever with people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure looked like when I'm learning to shake I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior and I think you've seen it now and the kind of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved\nVery significantly in the last week and it's in reaction to just pick up all\nAre and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats and they brought this on themselves and I think that they're not going to reap whirlwind\nOr I
