that she's going to get that cattle back is through California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when\nOrange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting 'cause most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in and which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can ...\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment at forty nine years that you know in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living a America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nTo where you had over regulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds a history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people ... and you're\nA state and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free healthcare for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats have thirty nine and found it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies whip them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThat unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats than in tight races\nAnd one other article came out and said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district a and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power and if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these\nYou're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nKnow fun
