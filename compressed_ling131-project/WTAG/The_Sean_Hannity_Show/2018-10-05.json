Democrats in an uproar angry that lashing out at the FBI\nWhat would they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say hyper Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has\nA good heart but I really feel like it's getting late here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or started down sounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a\nFew good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nThink the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes\nSo when he when he actually admitted when asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the same\nGuy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you know look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related I think it for three or four generations back a great great grandfather was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yesterday on my record with really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator ... like I'm not that hard because the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations\nAnd they're not going to offer opinions here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what it was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\nThou shalt not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a\nMedia hysteria that that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people within your window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh\nThey do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that that come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say\nWhen you look at these things you look at the polls seem to try to just to sing understood of what's in people's minds it's really hard to put it all together\nAnd how we should all be thinking or the not us a but how would you should be thinking of ah\nPeople not being angry\nThat the people that gave us more welfare less respect and dignity as human beings no matter what color you are are are less opportunity to get your family on a poverty\nHow could you not be in favor of of the people that's delivered that\n\nOh is that shallow oh is that lazy\n\nNot to understand that the bottle brush with the illegal immigration and other issues that are being addressed that won't be addressed by the Democratic party\n\nAnd I wish there were a moderate Democrats they could come out in and go away from this horrendous suicide mission that's an Iran that believes that the government more government is better job\nI Wish there were more moderate Democrats out there and I I really think it's time for multiple parties in this country to organize\n\nMaybe an ideological lines I don't know maybe we need a socialist party that's fine maybe we need a democratic parties that are real Democrats go back to the real Democrats\nMaybe we need a conservative ... just fine maybe where they don't look on the Republican Party though there are moderates and understand the philosophies of how to get jobs and how to create jobs and going to have a pro business philosophy and and wouldn't be so adamant about where they are\n\nYou know Independence Party of\nOh I don't need government potty to tell me how to get up in the morning and what to eat\nGod gave me a brain and I really know how to use the best of my ability anyway\nThat's kind of party I I think we kinda need a whole bunch of all because our system is really broke\nSystems totally broke\nWhat'd you have Democrats represent and how do they represent Republicans represent is there a\nClear line of of who who you are and who do you represent and why or who you're going to vote for and why is it is a singular I mean do you really going to vote for someone for seeing your issue a single issue is that is that it\nTo me to issue wacky eyes matter issue\n\nI think it's much more comprehensive than that there's a lot of pasta this puzzle a lot of pots still simplistic is people want to make it just isn't it's\nNot do you want social issues but don't you want social was was what will socialism\nJudy what\nWill be the end of it what would be the answer to it how will you how will you function\nAs a as a man or a woman as a father or mother or in a job place with children how will your own life be better\nIf we go to a more government more socialism to really believe there's going to be income

what she said she went through every aspect\nOf of the dialogue and we've been listening to this ragtag bunch of of garbage now for a week after week after week and she was able to sit down analyze the whole thing and maybe thirty minutes a describe every single thing she walked through to get to her\nA decision making process on the most damning as families with a speech that I've heard as I

I Believe Dr Ford something\nI don't believe facts show that it was a cat and all but I Believe something happen\nWith someone else who did it I think something happened to her it was no way no way all that we're in the ... what do you say to women who watched this process unfold her doctor for a story\nThat I haven't I haven't found any way even though they have and\nI've had people come forward I mean just so that is the lead her trauma the mom\nAnd my sympathy and they are here and I used to have\nAdequate FBI investigation\nInto having an informant for the phone from you know based on what you see it for the FBI was do you want them into the I think there's always was done I guess I looked at me and I make a\nDecision based on what you see that at a photo investigation but they have it was from my family was\nAlive so the people that I was concerned about how they said what they say how they did it by many places in the priority for you know I'm just a West Virginia was up for reelection a difficult race are you concerned debate\nAbout in which is why\nWe have from at all I Know that Bob the Thursday you bother me about the new law\n[noise]\nAll right that is the um [noise]\nWell that's the party of Nancy Pelosi if in thirty two day she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and all the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know party that is willing to put all\nDue process aside fundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with the guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments was in the beginning of of senator Collins speech today and how she rightly pointed out there was opposition\nFrom day one Chuck Schumer was one of them there was nobody that President Trump that was that was going to be nominated that was ever going to pass the get many Democrats from the get go and I do believe that that\nJoe Manchin probably a shortage reelection with this decision today but I don't really ... I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what he's saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today uh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society\nOr even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you had the same reaction I did I was I was done that I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant ah with with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a come Halloween legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins can damn outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination\nBackfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said uh was re counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThat even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard\nFor considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there there were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was very little probably the most impressive but I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I've said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a a serious response from the Republicans and I'm often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion\nAnd Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that Collins each wrote some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know the student to Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagree on some issues but it was\nHe thinks and that same vein you're absolutely right what she said was critically important again it emphasized the language of article ... section to a presidential have the power\nWith the advice and content that's what's been lost and all of this also critically important that she emphasized the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental American principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegation and a man or woman has built up a career is guilty was important for that\nUm I

speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen it was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was bought full it was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that for you to our beloved audience because it was something that I wanted everybody\nTo hear this is a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country\nCannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhen I really realized today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody I've interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect the the systematic\nBe she walked every American through her decision making\nProcess and frankly it was flawless it was spectacular\nNothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she followed every single
