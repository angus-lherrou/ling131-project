point\nThere is going to be a change people are getting used to these techniques and or we're going to live in a society where it's\nMore I got all the ... project baritone dot com Hannity dot com huh All right we'll be looking forward to to Mars tape as well and we'll continue our our airing of these things to a James O'Keefe we appreciate it seven days to go to election day [noise]\n\n\n\nThe [noise]\n\n\nAmy's swab\nThis is Sean Hannity show that this once or twice but it bears repeating\n[noise] and you can keep your plan if you're satisfied when if you like to play in your hair you can keep it if you like your plan\nAnd you like your doctor you won't have to do a thing you keep your plan if you like your health care where you'll be able to keep your health care plan if you've got health insurance you can keep it if you like your health care plan you'll keep your plan\nIf you got out insurance you like your doctor your like your plan you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan\nIf you have insurance that you would like Ben you will be able to keep that insurance if you like your doctor or health care plan you can keep it if you like your health care plan you can he keep your health care plan\nSo if you like your\nAnd you can keep your plan\nTo play if you like your current insurance you will keep your current insurance if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you're happy with what you got nobody is changing\nAnd if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and if you like if you want to pay less you can pay less\nThe truth and the reality is tens of millions of Americans lost their doctors lost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of the lie the big promise of Obamacare what is fascinating as we now head into the\nFinal week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program had project berets house dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's now been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat in North Dakota\nKirsten Sinema the Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are being honest with the people in their respective states they don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California\nOn top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I got to tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that\nPeople with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well where we're going to where\nWe support health care of preexisting conditions\nWhile the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the\nNarrow lie that Republicans want you to die\nRepublicans want dirty or water dirty air\nThey want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff\nOf course they're racist or sexist massaging as they can Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump so even though the guy that shot up the synagogue he's hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum\nAnd I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress and the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states which smart governors\nAnd little kids want to be what they want to be and with taking away their innocence\n\nFor kid wants to be kept in America you're going to tell them no because there is a a\n\nThere is a a anti American feeling out there you can't be Captain America is American or isn't just the greatest country and that's not politically correct to be a you know let's make America great again hat you imagine going trick or treating with a Donald Trump pat on tonight\nI'll look at like Donald Trump costume was All right to make masks of every president that was politically correct you could do that you learn is Brock Obama wherever Obama ... bye mum I never Trump mass\n\nThen as the animated features like of Disney's Mona setting ... Asian and Pixar's Coco which centers on a Mexican boy named make well in his family\nDoes they pulled the costume based on the character of the mowing voice Dwayne Johnson\nWho was included in a brown body suit with Polynesian tattoos and phone grass current husband was putting off to have a child with the skin of another race so your work costume and there was a brown skin costume\nAnd because you were not brown skin you could not where the cost and Disney pull that out of their movie that's one way of cutting today that's where we've come we have traveled a long way\nIn reverse [noise] so I Hope everyone has a safe Halloween out the other day and I hope your cultural appropriation has become part of who you are\nI Hope you sat down and analyzed every move you've made for your child\nAnd made sure that your child did not insult anybody made sure the child was politically correct make sure that you and your husband if you have a husband though you and your wife if you have a wife or you and your self has the conversation and make sure your child's offended nobody\nAnd also make sure that your child did not get more candy than any other child\nBecause if you're chop chop was more candy than any other child in any of the neighborhoods you went trick or treating and then you have to take that candy and distributed equally to every other child\nBecause that's what socialism is all about political correctness is part of it and then you have to share his Arizona's it didn't cost that much candy and there is now being denied\nFor kids but\nI'm Glad I was around when I was around [noise] we'll be back\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] is that Jordan let me show it's simple you'll have a right to be an anti Semite we just have a right to

know you couldn't show those it today you don't do it that way you could do it in a historical perspective but you couldn't do it today I wouldn't be accepted am I going to scientists and okay Bach\nAnd and you know I get it I mean I understand\nBut that that was it that was the culture doesn't make it right didn't make it right\nOf course it was wrong that black people couldn't eat in a restroom with white people cautious terrible the awful on you but the way people were treated in are treated today in this world and for many of us we close our eyes and and don't want to see it of course it's awful\nBut you can't hold a people responsible for actions that they did Seventy five or eighty years ago when that was the norm and that was the culture I mean we've come a long way thank God and yet we've reversed ourselves in a lot in a long way I mean when we were just\nWe were better off in a lot of ways I talked about the innocence of children\nI mean there are no board or go to the park and play\nYou go over there and I'm gods now in the box\nThere no more they can be going out and and uh where are you going and going out\nA record across the street and play in the school yard\nCan't do that anymore first of all is posted you can't go there and the second point no no mother a father to it on the kid go out there by themselves anymore so we better off\nBecause kids sit home now and then my traumatic media and and Google a guy goes through their eyes meet in the middle and they're trying to games and they talk to each other on the phones are they catch to each other or we better off we really better off when kids would just innocent and maybe said some stupid things that we just weren't very educated\nI don't know I don't know I think the purity of life was a lot different\nAnd it was a time that kids really with fewer and they just with kids it was a time that you could really just play and use your imagination were simple popsicle sticks or a pipe coming from my father could become an animal\nYep pipe commanders taken from my father and I'd make animals out of all\nThose were the innocent days now didn't give it a kid a pipe Clinton I first of all it's not politically correct that you shouldn't be smoking a pipe I don't even know if they have pipe commanders anymore anyway\nJust what it is so stay well be safe so they'd be careful about the other kids are out there trick or treating some goals small and watch out for and they'll be in dot map pants their outfits she'll be very careful state while I'm very nice day for another job well done and we'll see you tomorrow [noise] don't worry just be happy is uh\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nFor the synagogue shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTara for in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nThem if you got to stop the main things about me I'll stop and signing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether\nThe president knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated what Trump\nIs doing is stoking inciting\nFor the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his named anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality\nBetween these events and he ... he was dishonest\nAs they are blind I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that as being ... by the president of the United states for some\nReason was to manage them I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in in just a matter of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not it's in it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is it is what it is\nThe biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media is universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east one super all because of\nThe threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance was unsinkable maybe just the number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think it's just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about what they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nFinally admitting that year old white fashion list and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures uh that\nAre are linking George Soros and these anti Semitic threats\nTo the caravan Fox News talking about small pox and leprosy coming up it is I I'm Sorry I have a I won't say specifically what regime this is out of but go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and Jews\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not leaving ... biggest terror threats\nIn this country is white men most of them radicalized for up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them there's no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy banned [noise] so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be hearing in\nOn the two pillars of the media\nContinuing hit the trail attacks against and migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you things on the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms and invaders and\nInvasion these tragedies working at cross purposes right narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified gang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joyous pay heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also times got along with them as as his own all even\nJust like I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh he's in New York character he's not Republican or Democrat he's just an anarchist and [noise] and I don't mean that an ad hominem wet [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they are ...\nBut there are three scenarios as I said for election night will be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results\nBut I Do know this I Do see the er at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that the election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white flash it'll against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not it is they end up back in their head really fear you\nThe American people and what your going to decide\nEvery race matters there's four hundred and thirty five house races your vote for any Democrat or you stay home\nYou're voting for below sea as the next speaker all these important Senate races Florida Tennessee Texas Ted Cruz a Claire McCaskill a Josh Hawley Missouri Nevada\nOr

that and I'll get to that in a second but now with a poll numbers tagging going into the last week of the campaign now Claire McCaskill is getting more desperate\nNow she's begging Missouri voters to believe her when she says\nI support President Trump a hundred percent on securing the border\nWell that's odd because I don't think I've ever heard Claire McCaskill ever chant or talk about building that wall even once\nAnyway she told the fake news CNN that she supports the president a hundred percent to do what it takes to secure the border quote the impression he's given Missourians there's ... ... I had a cousin from Missouri Missouri what\nDoes that people say Missouri others say Missouri Laura\nI well you don't count because you have a language of your own which is called the ... which is called Philly street talk that added flavor of New York kill outcome um I support the president a hundred percent oh that desperation\nThat's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what a what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happen to vote the wrong way every single time for the last two years\nA we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied\nFlorida is the one state I'm worried about in terms of both the Senate and\nI don't understand this obsession with Gillum by the way he stuck taxpayers apparently with travel causes of fundraising about who's getting a lot of money from a we oh that's right we have breaking news on Gillum tonight don't we owe\nUndercover tape ...

Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and I actually look at the different levels you have a man named as one of the parents on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nGuilt or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I in some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll to having to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else and help them get back into New Jersey because we're over there you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great there see you know very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have may well\nBetween his own bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez if they just stay home\nThat many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure it out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out one voted to end up not having to buy election they do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats\nAnd about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning the bottom of about two oh one which would mean Pelosi where speakers and hiring them around to Twenty one to two thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up with speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think I Am ... and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for him and she should be no one should kids themselves if you do not want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd they're hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you then again she was smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services to 'em and she'd go down to less than you think to yourself\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all he don't like them or a senator or I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a half a vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you both for reticent in Tennessee\n... you're you're voting for humor and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims or a moderate Democrat hands for the poor for a leader can say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course and went on from that she was you know I sort of have to do that fine\nDefeat them there are a level if they say to you oh I'm really kind of a moderate Democrats you know I got to vote for Schumer defeat them I mean who's killing health care\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence that this is a team sport 'cause the radical end of the Democratic party is in control of their quality that their leadership or his kiss orderly
