things liberal all things democratic you know something they've never told the story of the eight failed years of Obama that's why in twenty two days three weeks from tomorrow you got to know something if you are in the states if you're in Montana North Dakota\nIf you're in Indiana if you're in Missouri\nYou're in Nevada Arizona Florida at Texas where Ted Cruz's running I'm actually going

be in a bracelet charm tie\nTie a scholarship and across the world you slapped a lot of Paris fifty billion dollars going into my life have you tried any way\nIt goes on from there I mean was it is just the typical thing that you'd expect um are we got a lot on the program we got this election and we're going to talk about it in detail we have the riots over the weekend in New York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd followed them into the department stores and restaurants and gas stations what do you think it's going to happen\nWhen those types of things are set and I look at the end of the day people who are responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this was going to look back here have Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed and all of this\nAnd we'll get a look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened to her and secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about oh other things like uh oh Sarah Sanders in our family and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife\nI mean at some point someplace somewhere something's gonna happen and if you didn't see it this weekend\nI mean you had a demonstration billed as a march for law and order in the streets of Portland descending into\nChaos as yet rival political factions now breaking into a bloody brawls downtown Portland on Saturday Night yet members of some group called the Patriot prayer\nI've never heard of them and their their black clad adversaries known as antifa using bear spray ... thrashing each other outside what's known as Kelly's Olympia that's a popular bar in southwest Washington street\nThat may laid which lasted you know fairly long period of time ... riot cops rushed in firing pepper ... sprays it the street fighters Portland police bureau reported seeing the protests\nAnd counter protests participants outfitted in with hard a narco gloves knives firearms earlier in the evening why didn't they do something about it\nWell he said to make one arrest Saturday Night not one but they're investigating this scene is unfolding amid tensions among both groups are fueled by impart uh some national news stories you had the marching in Portland against the police were brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's\nYou know they had a hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which was caught on tape that outrage many including\nUs some leader of this group out there patriot prayer in any way of viral law video surfaced showing in New York City members of the group which I also never heard of Proud Boys some type of male chauvinist\nOrganization a beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at a Republican headquarters\nThe way you have is you know I Know the media has been reporting that they were a group of white supremacist I don't I don't know anything about them\nBut there was a a hate rally at Republican headquarters in New York City anyway where you know the way the media is portraying it I just have no idea 'cause I don't have it but of courting to the Daily Caller and people are members actually vandalized\nFor ... and Republican club in New York I had a an appearance of\nThis group Proud Boys prompting an outbreak of violence they're fascinating that Andrew Cuomo the governor up for re election in New York is not going to have any trouble my opinion sadly he's blaming it on Donald Trump he blamed the president after ... attacked the Republican headquarters in New York City\nUm the Southern Poverty Law Center has a history of of smearing Republican organizations as white supremacists neo Nazis they labeled this group I hate group what did they call an ...\nYou know remember if you go back in twenty six team the same so called watchdog group put housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson on its extremist watch list Ben Carson\nBecause he supports traditional marriage um anyway Sarah quarter reported that the night before\nThe ancestry dot com I did a long time ago and you just give them some of your DNA some of your saliva think hair I forgot what I did anyway um and I turned out I was a hundred percent British child in other words Irish I had known all for my grandparents that come from Ireland a hundred percent is kind of rare but whatever\nUm anyway so loaded with Warren has released a DNA test that provide strong evidence that she had a Native American and her family dating back six to ten generations\nNow what it means is if you interpret it if our great great great grandmother was Native American that would put her at one\nThirty second American indian\nBut the report includes the possibility that he's only won five hundred and twelve\nNative American up the ancestor goes back ... generations you know this apparently done by Carlos boost the Monday from Stanford University professor expert in the field narrowly won some big twenty ten MacArthur Fellowship known as a um\nYou know a genius grant for his work on tracking population migration with DNA Analysis you know he said that the vast majority of warns ancestry is European the problem is is that when she was at Harvard the time that she was there and I believe one of the University She was teaching at is she was\nListed as Native American and that that's how they you know promoted her\nAs they're not that she got hired that way there was one report that said Harvard says they didn't hire because I've been in other words they're billing her as a better term\nAs Native American and if it's one in five hundred and twelve he's not really Native American\nAnd she let that go on for ever and ever and ever now maybe in an effort to get rid of the issue before her run for president and twenty twenty I guess that might be one of the reasons\nI'm All right when we come back we're going to go over all the

have said disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have said now I've seen the hurricane situations\nI changed my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhat and when I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back and we're talking about that and they said that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael ... says that they say I mean they say the ... what about the scientists say it's worse than I ever\nA show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda like camp during this just also have a political agenda\nWhere was it angle of the the altered climate change data it's science\nWas as Al Gore and others would tell you but it was so surely perfect there's no disagreement than the scientific community it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back at that time\nBy the way the job of started listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind or am I why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation led by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I've heard but\nYou know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoyed you I Know right off of all of my my interviews the ... she went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted a debate\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had\nNear record snow fall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold periods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties\nAnd nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal snowfall and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking high about five six years ago then they came down below and they're back you know normal now let me let me say this\nThe president answer the question perfectly here's why up until now climate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now\nOr you know whether they're going to anybody else better than anyone else I mean okay but when you look back at the earth temperature as it go out and cooler and then warmer in the warmer in the cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me get Leslie for\nIf if she lets thing if you are listening motive for examples intensified more rapidly that Michael right off the top of my head Nineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame a lemon David Cross the Atlantic is a tropical wave forty eight hours later a category five hurricane fill your with a hundred and eighty mile an hour wind gusts Corpus Christi went from a hurricane a category one to a category four in the twenty four hours coming into Corpus Christi Nineteen Seventy\nIn Nineteen sixty nine went over there in the pocket like shift for the hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds\nThirty six hours before fifty mile an hour tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless\nExamples of rapid feedback development it was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes of people say how did this happen how to ... it's right out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies\nThat you know the new rock star of the Democratic party ... got something like sixty million dollars he's thrown a Ted Cruz but Ted Cruz is still up by eight I'm

has been saying about people in our own state whenever she travels abroad or if you look at some of these other you know districts it's very very tight I honestly can't tell you what's going to happen in twenty six states like a twenty to twenty two days I Can't tell you\nBut I Will tell you you got to personalize this election I mean Nancy Pelosi look at her is that's who you're voting for be voting for a Democrat that say if you vote for senator that's a Democrat you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nAnd there are radical left agenda you know if you if you want to know what it's between lower taxes less government intervention\nYou know there's a fascinating piece on the Drudge Report what\nDo you think just in the top of your mind the top one what is it one thousand if I can find a four hundred and nine taxpayers the richest one thousand four hundred and nine taxpayers and America\nWell guess what that that one thousand four hundred nine taxpayers pay more taxes\nThan the bottom Seventy million Americans\nThe top three this according latest information coming from a Bloomberg\nAnd it's a year twenty sixteen\nBut individual taxes are paid by thinking about this the top three percent pay the majority of everything the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes and literally than the bottom Ninety percent one percent pays more than Ninety percent\nThe top fifty percent paid all the taxes Ninety seven percent we have redistribution\nThe bottom fifty percent of Americans only pay three percent of the bill that's it\nThe individual income tax system is designed to be progress if it is it is redistribution of wealth we already have the system and then when you get a little bit of your ... back because the ... the only ones that are getting problems back or people that pay you know but for the\nMiddle class that's a lot of money one and two thousand dollars and they say you want the crumbs back is ridiculous\nSo there's a lot going on this election and twenty two days\nNow I Would argue that what your tax savings is on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot are great comeback is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kids jobs in future is on the ballot your wages and for one case that's on the ballot your business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nIn all the biggest challenge is who's in charge of the future

Fox News President Trump and the first lady touring areas of Florida and Georgia torn apart by hurricane Michael\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia ... broke in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the dossier\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state\nWe have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is mark Elias market why it was ... he was ... for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nAnd it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former French and telling them to get them to uh get him in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not ...\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael with us Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue any subpoenas for we now know that the FBI or\nAm I fix and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was in fact conversations George Papadopoulos were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court you\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these things go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe

get some somebody without a ... to ... in the Justice Department they can do a criminal investigation there's also criminal civil litigation it's possible\nFor example Carter Page that discovery in a case that Carter Page Pickering would open up all kinds of information about what what\nHow long would that discovery take 'cause I Know Carter Page is moving forward with the lawsuit\n[noise] well it it just depends on the judge ... where you where you filed the case are there it's a slow docket or rocket rocket docket but none of this Shawn without that could have pushed the cooperation of the media without those journalistic with David Corn and Mike is a cost\nCutting out the information just regurgitate the information that they receive from uh the people who were doing this behind the

bed in a in a mosque out Ritz Carlton for example that's all being leaked even by high members within our intelligence community for the purposes of influence in the election with a with a series of lies and propaganda\nThen the same information is used again to create a special counsel and to really deal legitimize and hopefully dismantled the presidency of Donald Trump that's when it came down to\nWell there's no doubt about it a shot on that but as Victoria and I have been saying now for Eighteen months there was a brace a plot\nOf brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally in debt if she lost the election to frame Donald Trump and that is exactly what they did these people were motivated by an Anna this\nCourt Donald Trump which led them to fabricate evidence to use foreign intelligence services fabricate evidence to wiretap Americans ... and and when they found exculpatory evidence for example\nThat would have paper George Papadopoulos they hit it from the by the court there is no doubt\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and that Jeff Sessions\nAnd ride roses I cannot figure out a way to do this
