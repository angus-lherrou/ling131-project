at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting and history\nOf the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now\nRetired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments\nIt's usually by the time they get there it's it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not our big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely\nAnd even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because\nPeople obviously know nothing about me\nThey know nothing about you know they don't take the time they either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to the program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is cotton we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have been his his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot you know if\nYou see these cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow the inter restaurants and the department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\n... how is that going to end well told the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again Blumenthal\nWhen I was coming out there who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation\nI invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there that we have you\nKnow all these bombs that are sent out the first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life and even if it's being spent to silence made you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nPresident Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at the time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box\nBut you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch\nThe Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you\n... you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they lie and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter this guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times it'll Trump's surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a\nYou know bad word of a quote in ... infestation but despite those facts you have people you know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words\nMatter silences complicity what is he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part speaking sarcastically\nKrugman tweeting all linked to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do a Trump oh no\nIt's unbelievable how they now believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in the Daily Caller today and he's been a a passionate\nDefender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with Farrakhan for Khan one of the greatest purveyor of anti some medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nPittsburgh massacre comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism as well\nYou know there's there's rarely bashing Trump Peter Linder SARS store after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh where hearing where new calls to have a national conversation\nWell as long as we don't overlooked some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some of the ... the history now with the Democratic party that don't seem to be the supporters of Israel they once were and it's not limited just the Farrakhan you know yeah Palestinian activists Linda source shore well known that\nYou know she was a a lead organizer of the anti Trump woman's march where Madonna's said she'd dreamed an awful lot about blowing up the White House was not so well known as the association that many prominent elected Democrats have what's our store\nYou know and and just the last year she's been campaigning alongside some of the Democratic party's most celebrated a rising star alec Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez no wonder Cortez has adopted many of our shores well radical positions and it was ... brand herself introduced at a rally by source store and last week Ted Lieu reiterated his support for Linda is our store\nAnd she's been campaigning for Michigan house a candidate Rashida ... vows to vote to slash aid to Israel when she gets in Congress in August Bernie Sanders was campaigning weather and we are beginning to see something here is democratic candidates increasingly\nYou know they're they're being team with the most radical types of if it was if it was Trump I can assure you there'd be a lot of people speaking out All right we have a lot more to talk about we'll talk about how you know Fox is under fire ... fire house never Trump or is it just so bitter and angry\nIs too big facts getting in the way all the Republican Party rejects anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a room with Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about as anti Semitism and his racism\nThe shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently\nIt you know as Ron ... rightfully said uh this weekend on Fox News that you know these very all an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will seek their destruction\nIs standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism you know Sarah Sanders\nPointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever and what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised it never did it and making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel\n[noise] anyway we're going to get to all of that at Fox News similarly under attack I've got all the latest

relevant\nIt's getting scary\nWe had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police

two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard but possible people in New Jersey clearly\nFed up with an end us then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Guillaume ... got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic\nJob as governor and it'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh

the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all this as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows of plugged in Pittsburgh, PA along friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rose a very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes me my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning I mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's cuts and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt says you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nAny person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nI'll get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate is that bomb a nation what climate is he a way to sort of press releases about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ...\nPraises resume or day uh terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a brand she hasn't praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter and those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expected\nAll the way that I Would ever she would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with ... shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism and any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a rate their Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find me here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hand they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if you were influence\nAnd they said you're the factory ear you're working your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls from listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all that bend the artist that your listeners now\nNot representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group I'm a very progressive chase\nAnd they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everyone David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscure\nThat evil with courage and the sacrifice and and and that is truly are Americans and when they play the blame game on the media makes me sick because we knew what the story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he\nSaid that bullet hole church in numerous to count that we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been hearing one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be that said that Sean effectively are and ... as a nation I Know you agree that we aren't the nation we are

dead heat and that's both for Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and run the census was a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle you got a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back\nTowards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and we have British ... team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on and then he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers per Bredesen calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out the vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against the pony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically is just like Obama but she too like Brett as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota's down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have in a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat the only the only factor\nThere that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat\nHeld her seat in Nevada right
