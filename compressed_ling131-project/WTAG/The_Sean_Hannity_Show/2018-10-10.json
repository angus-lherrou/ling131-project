to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in adolescence MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick in a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor\nYeah All right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when they were having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are fucking back with able to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida have the ... county health are plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles to access some ... some ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWhy don't we ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price process two hundred and twenty dollars while using her were commercial insurance we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for

the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic planet if for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much with one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them an originality just throwing

which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this was a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher ... over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if the telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this is one of those times\nAs bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved and think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony rushing dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense\nSweat and in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre also saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nHe's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... you know that it was an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness and if they're wrong there's consequences\nWe all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just pay and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in ... when the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially of fights application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million to zero and then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified as we head into\nMay nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there is no there there\nBut anyway then they started ... media league strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may\nIn twenty Seventeen then they appoint rod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller but there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation\nThe whole house of cards the corruption those failing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate a judiciary committee's Iowa sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ... especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a raft musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think

knows new sitting running up against his business guy by the name of what was his first name John Cox\nDon ... and and Cox is now in a five point almost within the margin race against Gavin Newsom and one of the biggest issues to emerge as not only the sanctuary cities status of the whole state but\nThe proposal of gab a nuisance to provide free health care to anybody does it matter is you know rather than California citizen non citizen does it matter everybody gets free health care\nLook I look I Would ask everybody listening when I was just just close your eyes and think about ... don't do

better off than we were two years ago by a long shot\nWell that's what's amazing about the moment this moment in time as you know 'cause you know with the president last week and now we're we're we're talking with a guy\nWho has kept his word and deregulation kept his word and just kept his word and cutting taxes kept his word on getting better trade deals and you look at the results you think yourself\nLowest African American unemployment in history blow us Latino unemployment in history I think that down to what Nineteen sixty nine is the last time we were just good for everybody in general you know this\nThis is really working and that's what is that it's like this year was ... and resistance and the president is focused on results and the Democrats are focused on assistance\nYou know I think that that we have an opportunity here I just hope the American people are awake to what is at stake here and um you know I go through what the democratic agenda is and it is very dire to me endless investigation they want to impeach the president\nThey want the the higher taxes even though Americans will see in a thousand two thousand dollar extra dollars in their pocket every year that's real money for real people we're seeing manufacturing jobs coming back jobs we were told would never coming back\nWe see the the mid west growth now beginning a comeback that
