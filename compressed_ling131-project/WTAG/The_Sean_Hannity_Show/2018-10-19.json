years in the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the sent for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it real\nIs it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country and I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us I joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government that hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that as you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo I bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roads called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey have been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over ... only to be turn out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now\nWe see in in just the last two weeks oh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here doesn't have time to testify under oath\nLens Simpson has pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for thinking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone both defies the court and otherwise and government you hit the\nProbably the most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good let's work as the vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talk about this Ninety nine page report\nOn fire the court the abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law they they're here by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet and that's a fight the quarter review\nThere is a court that sit above the five to ... it will also under their rule for considered procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you are right now that that just ... percent telling talented different circuits maybe maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the plate in the form for a motion to review what's going on in the fight the court also\nJust remembering you have in the five support efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges a fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information\nTo spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach Collyer though because I think judge and the fifth corps envious judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime the most sensitive area of our government probably because it's a part a application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nNo you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival start with you to get your reaction considering you\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as\nOf now have you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled and not just basically a I don't know chink in the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about\nThey use phony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies in the federal government Solomon points out that should be immune to special interest schmoozing the the OJ as premier law enforcement agencies like the FBI\nThe DEA the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential to their success in the trust the American public puts in them but\nThis week the D.

allowed hundreds of their employees to accept free travel\nLodging food from special interests across the blood globe and I'm looking at it this and I'm saying you know\nReally you've got to be kidding me because if anybody else did this\nThat would be called influence peddling and on top of the list we got a guy by the name of Andrew Weissmann new accepted apparently more than a dozen free trips your reaction Carter\nSean you know this goes back to sort of the crux of the matter in terms of my case and all the abuses that happened around day it's not about me and it's not about any ah any you know specifics in terms of myself it's really about our country and I think what you see in terms of some of these ah actions\nThat they were doing I'm against the rules and potentially against the law that really reflects you know people just looking out for themselves and yeah it's like President Trump always said as a candidate or it's not about me it's about us and you know\nWhen

of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they were just that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels\nYou can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using in this I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him so they'll fly from Mexico\nInto the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map\nOut where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful or the president while he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done\nThat in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and\nAny sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws and\nWe know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI

fascinating anyway we'll just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that reticent has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona or by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha ... Sally\nIs fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott is always there was an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out\nIs our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think\nYou played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up on me and when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the ... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're\nThey're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the chili and I've seen guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between\n... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up in the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is if the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go away because of his eight\nOperationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek while I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at it yeah it was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty six team\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated vets are coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ... if you stay home it's I have a vote for below sea and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know Brett is and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn and you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep a bomb a care that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we were told me a bit of a leading Indiana is say a key pie you say go to wall and he's saying no impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out at the Joe Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but\nHe was running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were factors party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we could go in a lot better I think you're probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me\n... all one word answer on that one is money\nSo she'd raising enough money\nYeah ...\nThat's what it's all about and and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national poll that there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want to ask you plug shoe speaker done only twenty three percent of all voters should yes fifty six percent said no\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know the chapter\nThat these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or a woman oh their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so think\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you it for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans\nThe Democrats are pouring millions of dollars or to the races right now\nWhat in the patio and he's ...
