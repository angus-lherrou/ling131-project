now but um [noise] in any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation\nA number one for so where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witnesses being coaxed July people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the problems we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think you look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd

I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to ... to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she works at that at every Democrat that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing\nTwo weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets ... and many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but anyway this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they spoke to fourteen different times they've found now they've indicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be\nWatching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but but it\nUp you know the parents who bought a reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm\nSomebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to\nLie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't as ... as well make that cap force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted a former your classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why puppet he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it sounds so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of

I Can't be who I really am\nA ... well that's the problem you're basically admitting that you're fraud\nExcept that now that you're you're ... you're losing the burden or read yourself but the burden of facing the voters well now you're going to be who you really are that's what it sounds to me which kind of as a mission that you've been dishonest the whole time and so I have a suggestion if this is a trial balloon and he's thinking about running for president\n... ... ... in the game go run you know there's a way to get Supreme Court\nThrough and that is you could become the president then you can pick your own person you can do what you think is best then you can be\nAs boring as you want to be is president every single day and maybe yeah maybe President Trump has more personality but you notice the style it's always comes down to style\nYou cannot argue with the results is what the media is fixated on his what never Trump is fixated on there is an anger at the president's iconoclastic you know bombastic at times you know style that's what it's about a eight hundred diaper when Sean a toll free telephone numbers we continue our nation's capital\nAnd they Sean Hannity

the Democrats\nAnd the senator from Hawaii that once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigate and nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated in every case there's no ... operation\nAll none and and multiple changes and\nStories at least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and this lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it even saying that well she gave us for names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is\nAnd the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack on a story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously re Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus have the audacity to make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court\n... hair his righteous indignation his his to our rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact\nTo preserve his position right to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would have to have that kind of\nIntimate Cairo how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused to react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're greed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nOr individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\n... garden at ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself and robotic if\nHe doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially legal she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself and it was a mashable reporter because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is\nUnfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the\nAmerican people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in\nHigh school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement saying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying\nIn fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the interview which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick\n... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term here the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing\nEither way and the people know that what they've done is way except that uh and pernicious\nAnd I think that the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory and and the Democrats had they acted the way they have than a loss in them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for it's\n... wedding and we we always blame our
