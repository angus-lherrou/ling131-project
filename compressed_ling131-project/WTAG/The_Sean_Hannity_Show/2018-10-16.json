Iran I don't like what happened in return money one use radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine FM double duty AG\nOur\n\nThis is Glen Winfrey another McCaskill campaign staffer the way he details a plan for impeachment of President Trump is revealing so here's\n\nThe moderate [noise]\nWhat do we know the modern redrawn than men hammer\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd all of you know\nThat\n\nWe discovered that McCaskill is receiving money from democratic US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nAnd they get money from marijuana to our lungs pack okay another one of those things where we get the money and mine you know even on the deal yeah I was in a flash honoring or\nI think the money [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they asked to unless they specifically asking voting for the wall we shouldn't let them do what they need to think so I think she's on the wall and they don't ask me then let them think that\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment gesture shop about uh we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course you would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know in our staff is saying well we'll wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now with you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAn Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn now by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us he's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by fumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all of a staffer Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey wanna McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is that the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views no I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so we're doing is exposing\nYou don't want you to be honest I agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win and ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses in play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIf you both for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when I came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffer the staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is honest because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so tiny very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week\nBritish and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well in all these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program or later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing um you know the one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in this video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban we asked her staff or what type of ban is that it's semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nI again I think that you're rocking the world of big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying in explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that help them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies that conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then ...\nThere to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice they're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes\nI think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people are already\nWe've got we've gotten request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have gotten more missions if I ... but they're you know it's people are already early voting and some of these states and they get the the bigger issue is\nLike I said to you last week or the few days ago about don't lie to the people I ask this guy next roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to lie y y ers or politics so broken that that becomes a condition you having to win the honest because voters aren't going to\nAnd Tennessee this guy just lost there's a new poll out New York times poll and he's down fourteen points after video\nPeople find that stuff out but some of these senators Sean only going to run for one term so they say like Heidi Heitkamp\nWas his name was ... ... yeah they said well I mean that's the point the lie to get the one term and stay right there James O'Keefe\nAh project Vera ... dot com you can see the videos we've linked it on Hannity dot com\nUm and the big question I'm going to ask him when we get back is is they're going to be more\nUm when we come back to at the bottom of the half hour we're going to compare the Obamacare act versus direct primary care and what is the answer to the to the big problem of health care and we're going to look at the the media corruption as it relates to\nEvery year millions of Americans use ... to manage pain\nPain can be unrelenting overwhelming and all consuming\nWhy so many of us
