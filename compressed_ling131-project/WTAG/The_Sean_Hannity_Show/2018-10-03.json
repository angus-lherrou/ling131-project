I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct and so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredible lead\nIncredible lead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalposts Geoff oh did you sing committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in its scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the\nGreat senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that fell bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ...\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party\nAbandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump with say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a damn ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kavanaugh\nBut they have on them is that this was the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years if you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a

matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nNow I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today\nForgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nTo the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights\nFundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nThat have covering the cabin okay is because it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people\nThey found out Mr Ramirez was actually no she didn't know herself\nIf it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him well that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had\nBeen in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Michael I have a nominee alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drug ... almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties\nBut as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week\nPrior how does that become news and yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well\nThey weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some collaboration\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe Felice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just falling falling for someone who sent U.S Supreme court [noise]\nVery glad we need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves bringing in drug\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight

October twelfth\nAll right they've had the FBI investigation\nNow we know that we can have an up or down vote in the Senate so who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party that in every single case even though there's no core operation\nEven though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know a data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis to rape girls are winding up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups\nThat's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is\nFor every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window Newt Gingrich is with us a former

how are you\nI'm doing well I think you know\nYou can't have shame if you're only interest is Rob power and that's what we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power of the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil\nBest raw power or the kind of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in that that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've\nSeen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh they're lonely do it I Believe of impact is enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week it most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I've been I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been\nA smear treated with a vicious personal attack all those things I think mean that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper\nUnderlying lesson to all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that pass and Republican for the most part with a few bumps\nPickups in the road have been in power since um how to Republicans\nNow I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi opium Minnesota he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you weren't resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president has set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks telling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence said like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not push of a lot of work to do but we're coming back and now we have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be you want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to shave our children from MS Thirteen gangs professional and promote\nThe death or you prepare to be part of a chain ones constitutional judges not radicals I think we got campaign could be ... and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear a optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly and Indiana a a a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power they're\nShown course now that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six change should we shall I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nDon't want radicals who are we running and then finally a president's brilliant speeches the United nations laid out what's going to be one of the great issues by two thousand plenty do you want to government and American job\nWorries about Americans or do you want an American government your words were globalism and international bureaucrats and I think the Democrats are so committed\nTo basically spending America propping up international bureaucracy that to the gap there's going to be so huge that somebody's you\nKnow I think these are at times unlike any other you know what's exciting is we are on the verge fourteen states record low unemployment record low unemployment Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans sixty five year low unemployment women in the workforce youth unemployment fifty year a fifty five year low this is such\nAn opportunity ending burdensome regulation new trade deals that's all of this means that Americans have an opportunity now the forgotten men and women during the Obama years to prosper more than they ever have\nNice cars nice home safe neighborhood vacations to Disney ... that dream is within every buddies reached with the proper plan for economic growth\nMatch right hand everybody likes the direction we're going again everybody who watch more jobs everybody who wants to be sure that we're safe from illegal criminals and drugs\nEverybody wants to have a system the practical and worked out that got to go I mean that's not only be the key because elections come down to who shows up and who votes\nOr we're going to leave it right there Mr Speaker thank you so much for being with us we're pretty sure that we'll see on Hannity tonight on our said we've got some breaking news and new developments we have one story on the deep state obviously we're watching now very closely with the closing now\nOr in the near end here of the FBI investigation scheduled vote in the U.S Senate there'll be very interesting to watch\nMay want to call your Senate switch board has to be a senator too old to two to four thirty one Twenty one too old to two to four thirty one Twenty one [noise]\n\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nThis guy is evening temperatures will be in the mid fifties ...
