Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nAnd it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send your talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take that said and I don't care if they're not going to\nUm ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about seeing as you said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss that Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom which we the Congress has it and ... issue any subpoenas for we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information was in fact conversations George ...\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those conversations they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had\nNo evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district call me as relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe

Hillary Clinton you can't be civil and kick 'em and\nGetting you know follow them into a department stores and gas stations you know maybe on the heels of nobody in the Democratic party condemning what happened up Pam Bondi here's the Nielsen the secretary of homeland security or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant or Mitch McConnell at an airport\nYou know it's just play a little bit of uh some of the marching orders\nYou cannot be careful with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the [laughter] ... he can start to get\nYour body cabinet\nBilling thank\n[noise]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today

their face ... crowd push back you're not welcome here anymore follow them into the gas stations department stores et cetera\nYeah up in their face wow I condemned the violence on all sides here I I don't ... patriot prayer proud boy I don't care who you are this is\nThis is the United states of America this is not you know some banana republic where people are out there killing each other on the streets everyday\nI invited on somebody that I disagree with strongly politically but I think makes a good point and condemns all of those with me\nOr Sally cone she's a a super hard left wing or ... you don't mind me saying so the all through the book the opposite of hate and the host of a state of resistance a podcast\nOr do you tell people to follow Pam\nBondi and and Sarah Sanders family and and secretary Nielsen into restaurants and getting their faces and confront them and great a crowd and push back in ... that advice you give people\nSee you know Sean this is one where I first of all Hi nice to hear your voice and\nDoes he hates when she has never agree with me and she's going to now like\nI'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer because uh when I was an organizer you know before when I met I was ... when I used to organize protests like Sina are going to people's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right which are that's where the people's business is supposedly down but we're talking\nPeople's lawns cetera um you know I support and a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and these protests those sorts of protest now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against\nA you know going up to you know across the people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera I Do think you are\nI I Love you say you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been wrapped up or you know that that if we can talk about\nViolent rhetoric and we're going to look I think it's all bad but like ...\nRhetoric is now the tax or the the heart of the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write you use to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correctly yes why would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in a house because I kind of a rule leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't met maybe maybe today that second one I don't know maybe it'll be accused of being\nSome of those policymakers might be winning so leave the husbands children alone to where the partners whatever again I'm not saying it a ... or some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because I ... on that has changed\nBut we'll hire hearing out regularly ... these sounds to me like marching orders creator crowd push back followed them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm not hearing the Republican side and my point to you is this look I think it's very hard to try I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now hunger is\nGet to walk the halls without\nWhat is now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone in that are\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ... and they\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents\nAnd I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear\nWhat I don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again look\nFirst of all you're ignoring them of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you're if you're going to be ignoring examples of Donald Trump only\nWhen people stood up protecting him saying I've got to hurt him if you know I'll send you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent\nGas stations department stores what do you think is going to happen what lightly scenario if they listen to her\nI don't know what

into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisor was brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan Hoffman Fox News contributors thirty or CIA up operations officer\nA doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the visit ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThe new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate\nThis man was a journalist wasn't and Americans that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common pay ... you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of factor the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um the ... of the twenty first century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil roof brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day that Chris Yogi entered and we know he just show again never exited the costs\nAre we do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... the one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly this numbering\n... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to do that they report posts for to\nThose are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the facts emphasize that the ... issue of rape is a concern to us\nWe'll get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters\nI Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power with poison back in March British home secretary said they needed a voice speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would highlight is that well\nThey say it was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh and the other in a central or in in ... probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shows\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics or self domestically it is the author of the possible must be a over the perfect\nI'm On the truth fish or we have a lot of a matter of rich or with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very good ties through a and B has been found them and uh with uh those relationships are not going to be tested but this is a nation\nPartly sunny the forecast for Sunday no chance of morning show ... much cooler
