I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations of businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your poetry to raise taxes take what you've got take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has a fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has a fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to the house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit his looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races\nNow that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite as far\nAnd I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction of Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do\nI think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York uh I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing stayed even a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got\nI got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me in the end of it stems cells are the streaming service or write to\nMe it was it that they are because that's who they are they the conservative state so you notice that it's not a\nSimple number one Hans within a sad life oh no one can\nI'm a I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no places for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina in South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be I Know you governor governor the you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nWhen I went off as you would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nSpot Johnny Williams will you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nI I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\n... it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them\nThat the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country\nI Know you're not exactly run for the Supreme Court but if if you check out\nThose are the half of my junior junior and senior year I was tending bar till four thirty in the morning a lot of night then\nYou know I was just tell you I didn't show up half the time so that's probably a good thing people don't even recognize that I went there with lots of witnesses yeah I'm sure there as well we'll dig 'em up somewhere from forty years ago uh All right John McLaughlin and a dog show and thank you both for being with us [noise]\n\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nClass guys this evening temperatures will be in the lower ... for Saturday mostly cloudy maybe a chance of rain much cooler with highs around fifty degrees said that I mostly we'll lose drop in the mid thirties every Sunday sunny with ... you can get your forecast anytime a W ... dot com keyword weather\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe use of Maryland or terrifying attractions one location designed to scare\nThe American advertising federation presents an ad week DC\nAn annual conference for area marketing advertising in communications professional this year's Avengers brands like Mars National Geographic envy ... such as box Daily Caller in CNN speakers from agency said just over will be adamant in whatever way if you're a member of the marketing and advertising community there's no better\nPlace to further your education and providing\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them right for\nCall today and we'll get started\n...

kind of a convention or festival or some such thing\nNew Yorker reporter Jane Mayer suggested that in an interview that\nShe and her Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told him Elle magazine her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this the first story\nThat was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from all the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Avon ladies client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting\nYeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your or high\nThey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments at a ... liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quoted came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility for Barbara ... and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his and brushing barbarism I just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a Barbara's ...\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nIt seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more thing that\nThink it was before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time there they see a\nIssue was a labor laws and um when\nYou know what purpose\n... my ... the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means\nMy point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nAlready know about it in the paper tomorrow ... be

I'm In a real well we've got thirty seconds in our time to get into another subject carrier Mr Mr Horwitz I'm appreciated that but I Do think it's interesting that you had you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away and like all the other text messages we had to wait until the final report\nRight our to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the D. OJ face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage that Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council\nMember James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue\nSo Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI I remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but\nMaking those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the O. J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell rag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... Lisa Page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the ... well it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd they got rid of all it was was the dot CA recycled the different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so it would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director if it's allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from just after market may they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump or fire read that investigation he gets fired\nAnd what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that roses have a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he gets something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove that confident and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with ... with the ... I'm sure record talking about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI to eating a crime here that\nIn fact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nSays that job for the FBI the twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know it was so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials that the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent who are what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing\nTheir power and the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nAccording to most slug voice to re development authority approved to your point handle throws funding of five hundred forty five thousand six hundred fifty dollars for the initial phase of ...\nAmong others suspended Massachusetts state trooper previously used ...

you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have this conversation\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles to access in Turkey and we're ... the phone ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWater we ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody shock Gavin Newsom ... who is now offering free health care for everybody it whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nOff for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family of dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household ah the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's where we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ...\nYou know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well I'm a care made that illegal\nAh so it's ... just brought box or expanded access to these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more\nSimple than that I have a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the caution and asked the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nBeen but goes in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate the model around

just thirty second you know your heart rate them it's normal pork atrium ...\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics and he's a Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections uses a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility well\nI think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise] um and you know we just don't know that but\nYou're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American Pie\nIt's written Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on\nA on a regular basis for Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and then teach math to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that the toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic or the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people\nOther ah why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nDoesn't wanna transcribed interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does this leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr ... let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein words ally as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a faults in misleading statement of Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the ... which is why this is so critically important\nOr they've got to do and they shot a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have given but I don't let your books or do they write great job Greg Jared congrats on the successor the rush of hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempted sabotage that Donald Trump\nThat soon to be a best seller thank you ... appreciate you both being with us when we come back whether bell dot coms job of starting we'll update us next [noise]\nWhen we come back more of the best of the Sean Hannity shows they do [noise]\n\nSo with your back against the wall and her birthday or anniversaries just days away who do you trust one eight hundred flowers dot com right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses\nTwenty nine Ninety nine a one eight hundred flowers dot com we'll give you another doesn't end up vase absolutely free choice between gorgeous red or multi colored roses is absolutely yours one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon but in my last name Hannity one eight hundred flowers dot com promote Hannity this offer ends on friday\nHigh ... one of the biggest outrageous I've reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now\nHow the woman goes into a company comes down and there's no police report and\nI helped expose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not to divorce in the ... amazing Cormac God's smell is perhaps the most politically through the look of American bring friends and family who do not want to leak opportunity to change hearts and minds about\nAbortion ... rabid PG Thirteen out from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast to\nClear this evening and overnight very cold with Lowes in the mid thirties so for us to budge were you in effect from one to nine on Sunday Morning\nWe'll see some of these guys on Sunday with high temperatures in the upper fifties Sunday night mostly clear not so cold is lows over in the lower forties on Monday show or is likely ... sixty you can get whether any time twenty four seven\nW E a G dot com\n\n\nYou\nAre listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show\nThem out on the show and the answer one else does America deserves the truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable to a thriving and vibrant society [noise] she'll citizens from government overreaching and arbitrary ...\nPursuing truth means always yielding to the fact [noise] even if they run counter to our house [noise] in a courtroom truth about credible evidence [laughter]\nStrong opinions\nAbout me a lot of talk about ... ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out anything incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed ... David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and I'm from Detroit well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys an application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for\n... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony and he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where\nThere's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nAh as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "13"}
