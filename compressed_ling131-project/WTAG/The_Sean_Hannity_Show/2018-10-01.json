I had one of the thing is ... ...\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG and double duty ADHD Worcester and I argue radio station [noise]\nAnticipates complaints from Democrat but the Senate majority leader says to find a deadline for the FBI to complete their investigation of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stance from Fox News can't help it live on Capitol Hill and\nInvestigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people\nIn an attempt to corroborate her story that couldn't find one person was first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said this is a credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them\nLast week 'cause they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally\nThat there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations here look if as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people I mean that's just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this first six long weeks she had this packing job why\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nA professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein and they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety\nAnd this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart\nAn all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brett Kavanaugh on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F a wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at under the you know that one of your perjury I mean ... ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they all agreed that ... that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified and eye witness to the event that eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements that ... there's nothing else really left for them to do\nPlease use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say\nI mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come forward please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow it's turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and\nSo they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to uh blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just the norm is you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so he got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today and he said that he was a pollster was the Clintons poster\nAnd he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America as a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has [noise]\nIt it diminishes any chance they have but getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at

investigation\nWhat does it have to do is read I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is the kind of but I Know but how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit late I think that anybody ever trick or treat deal will pass through Congress her a I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots\nOther alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair which is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustrial opposite our country loves it if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the\nProgram well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nThe FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they now want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI had\nTo do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of the left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remember Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now we got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron York ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not\nKevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly at an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be\nDo you really want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults as I said really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as can be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe something while he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that but what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge how\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H meaner cheat I mean when you when you have when you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women [noise] who break into\nA an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules to get what they want and I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me in a plane historian from it because\nI spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example you're getting one Blumenthal who as the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't know suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than\nPlainly state it is the you will destroy the government\nUnless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruin and all events close quote I the reason I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not cake she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them and the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at ... at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nUm right when you are but the point is\nI think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people\nBecause if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is nobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever or not we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son I mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication\nTrent over a year or is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation they they don't think the truth matters what matters is power\nAnd I think people need to understand\nThis election is a choice about which America we're going to become much make a choice and just the president this was literally about are we going to reward people or just destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\nAnd insist on people frankly are getting us results and if you think of this was an option of results versus resistance look at today's news about Canada and Mexico once again the president as a breakthrough once again something is being done\nLife isn't always go as planned divorce child custody even
