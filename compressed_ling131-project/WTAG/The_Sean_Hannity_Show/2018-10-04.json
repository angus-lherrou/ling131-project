{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "A really good guy by the name of Lin wood uh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job uh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe for the same reason he's the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job opening up the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out their wealth discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nGovernor out I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and wears Jeff snowflake gonna vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to three I mean mixed McConnell I had been a real war here and pushing for actual churning graphically not ... and I've gotten a crap you're exactly right but then it gets a week ago if we would have had\nLike Harvard or calcium or San I think he here that we might not ... ... ... and I said I have not because I had any faith and Democrats\nThat'd be ... they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or\nThirty percent margin that people want to see an confirmed by thirty percent margin that people have North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr high can't or match or don't you're not vote for the nominee energy that people get their humor lack God that they might get out of their own political okay\nA coup Beckley right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and end flake or or Murkowski inflate\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean I was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah I mean [laughter]\nDon't come into real does wrong principle is man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's a conscious of the conservative ... and if you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter]\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right that is the thank you both for being with us he couldn't get Fifteen votes I I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state\nRace it off to the northeast New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and nobody's interested in the guy that says though I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again oh so every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick a break we'll come back coming up we're Victoria

Fox News five officers in Florence County South Carolina gunned down toxicity Rapaport has more line\nOf something and it gets printed by the New Yorker and the New York times of all places well they spend an entire week calling dozens of people and they learn that the accuser is calling former classmates asking them if they remembered what happen because the accuser saying to them well she's not really sure what\nHappened then you've got the whole well\nWere putting drugs and they were drug in girls almost on a weekend basis I went to Penn of these parties myself and and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train raped as they were lying in the hall and they're not balls into while I saw him near the posts\nBowl and and I saw him give red solo cups the people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top\nAnd the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration not the case of professor Ford not the case of Mr ... Ramirez and not in the case of Julie sweating it know co-op corroboration\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing\nWelcome both have you back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rapes somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody I mean that's that's what the media's going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's uh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers to help it you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chains do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz who was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this\nI Know that we have now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nYeah well I think um what has happened\nWith Julie sweating it is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself a publicity is very very important that ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story there is most of the education for Mrs Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied I was like her lawyers did not tell her that\nThe committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who\nOr whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I ... there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats cats by the way who said well\nPaula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the\nCase of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know I mean we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world I\nI may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense\nAny victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know\nThat there are real evil predators there are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now I push this so far\nInto a ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably\n... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent shot us than happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and picking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned the music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to yourself in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys and it just turn the music ups and one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down so many flaws in what she said\nI just

testimony that will ... innocent voice that seem cannot match or professional standing\nI look I don't want to go into it to me that the ... ... it's not even relevant to the issue I that's my honest take here's what we do know that matters facts truth matters serious allegations it's not about how it's presented it's whether or not it is credible\nAnd what we have is in the case of professor Ford no location how did she get to and from the where the alleged ... events took place\nMisconduct allegations et cetera et cetera um remember no corroborating evidence no location there is no forensic evidence there is no one that backs up or claim\nThe people that she identified at this at this house where this alleged incident happened nobody corroborate that the one I witnessed she says in the

radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG mentality and this is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG and double duty AG HD Worcester and I argue radio station in Washington\nAs the Senate prepares for a procedural vote tomorrow morning that will pave the way for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nVote a large Kandahar\nAlleged assault had occurred\nAnd they did their due diligence and they interviewed the four people and under the penalty of a felony all four people went on the record\nAnd some didn't remember the party in any way shape or form including professor fourth one of our best friends\nAnd professor forwarded identified mark judge who's the one guy that would have been an eye witness to this alleged assault back thirty six years ago he said absolutely positively did not happen\nAnd then when the Democrats you know and you have senator snowflake going along with senator Coons that all we just need a limited just limited in scope just a quick short investigation FBI they should be able to wrap it up well in this case and we'll talk about the other cases as well\nWell in this particular case we don't have a place we don't have the time we don't have a location we don't know the house we don't even know the exact year to be honest\nAnyways so they had very limited\nRoom to to corroborate professor Ford store\nAnd what the the only available venue for them or avenue for them to pursue this case remember they were never going to make conclusions are recommendations that's what we learn from Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One anyway they sprung into action they went out we had already had professor forwards\nA testimony now multiple points you know even though there was some inconsistencies between her testimony before the Senate and our test and the account that she had given to the Washington Post and her attorney failing to hand over any evidence as regards in regards to how the polygraph was\nAdministered or any of the therapy notes that they willingly handed over to the Washington Post without hand that over to the FBI so\nDeborah cats who was the liberal activist attorney for professor Ford has donated tens of thousands of dollars to liberal causes and candidates and she's the one that set off Paula Jones ... come on I was only ten twelve minutes I mean that doesn't constitute\nAny type of work for sexual harassment well that shows she's not consistent on the issue that was the person recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nWho's making the recommendation while she's meeting privately with judge Kavanaugh and not telling him a thing that any of this is going on that's the left wing activists lawyer though that professor porn I or don't blame her I mean Dianne Feinstein was the one that suggested at all\nAnyway so the only avenue for the FBI to pursue in the case professor Ford was to ask\nBefore people that are ready testified under the penalty a felony the same questions that you would normally asked were you there do you have a recollection no no no no no and mark judge you eat your supposedly an eye witness did you see this behavior this account of professor reports happened\nNo and after that I don't see any other area where the FBI has any investigative tool available to them to go down and discuss\nThe story that already been told by judge Kavanaugh as his passionate denial and the story been told and varying accounts and the Washington Post and when professor Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt wasn't that hard a job for the FBI Democrat says oh now the fixes it what are you talking about\nWhat what else can they do at that point\nWhat other investigative tools they have\nIf somebody makes a serious allegation about a a serious crime committed\nAnd they identify an eye witness in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the eye witness denies it the person that is accused denies it\nThere's no other venue avenue of of investigation that they need to go into what\nThey went further even though the New York times had well a lot of problems with Mrs Ramirez his story this is the\nThis is the case that happened that was printed by the New Yorker remember that particular case and in the ... case she was claiming well back in the first year when he was a freshman in college said he exposed himself to me\nWell after the New Yorker piece came out then the New York times they went out for over a week interviewing their words not mine dozens of people all in an attempt to corroborate the story of Mr ... New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody\nYour time says like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr\nCab and all was the one who exposed himself\nWell I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add\nTo it her own admission achieve quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories\nAnd of course we've got door number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweat Nick\nAs soon as the woman that as being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News because she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of them or they wouldn't respond one is dead and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and you had an ex boyfriend that had found a restraining order against her and I I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence of what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend\nAnd well anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go\nFrom here I remember Mr wet neck was claiming that on a regular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis that these boys including Brett\nKavanaugh as a teenager in high school that they were regularly happened often almost every weekend she was a time of the parties that they were literally drug in girls against their will making sure they got an ... capacity hated and that they would line\nUp in the halls of the boys and the boys would then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well I don't know if he's spike the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl and\nLining up in the home I I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a hall\nIs is not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison and number two guy at the DNC always\nNow thinking of resigning his position as the number two guy at the DNC not one person not one Democrat angry today that the FBI investigation didn't go on and in perpetuity\nAnd that we're going to get a vote finally on Saturday up or down if if judge Kavanaugh's if we if this stands what they have done here\nWithout any corroboration in any case and I'm not even talking about the outright lies that we're told and stories that were created and pushed into the media\nBut if you if we're now going to convict people based on\nAccusation guilt by accusation or is Spartacus Cory Booker said well I

of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I don't care

special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think this could be\nOne of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush\nTo

real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a dismal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the

will go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their
