{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "And those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from\nBut some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting\nFor quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday this week we're going to issue a subpoena\nTo the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but not far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the roof or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back the man that's in the middle of all of this and I\nSaid do you know what the news is tomorrow do getting bits and pieces of information about what's\nHappened there ... there we have people that know that were there that don't understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in the scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence CIA up guys absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy to share\nInsights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that food does have a network\nOf of their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that well\nIn terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the\nDNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're\nPaying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this and first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about\nThe intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had this buys a war against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within a ... just a couple of days of oil and the uh first Pfizer weren't\nWhich I think first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's when we said wait a minute there's a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there again because it's all\nAbout you know media perception what are they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything\nThere's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah it's basically everything I've done\nCarter Page thanks for being with us we always

Know it's hard to get people motivated for mid term elections I Hope this wakes you up I Hope this motivate you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nNow we know Harry yet another institution I'm broke and and the kind of try to frame ... Supreme Court is heading into a crisis of legitimacy\nAnd uh and when when not half when judge Kavanaugh helps them to chip away at civil rights voting rights women's rights abortion rights or I don't think it's very very well with the country he promised that he'd be a hardcore partisan and he will be that the one thing he didn't lie about it on the road\nLess hedge survivor Dr Ford has one we don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you because we're forced to read that there is no indication\nLet's not forget means people would go to church and then go to the mention the clothing themselves and morality and that's what we're seeing today\nOr let's get to let's say Hi to Dan is in Charleston Dan Hi how are you glad you called sir\nI'm doing great show and thanks for taking my call hey thank you how\nThe uh the the O. J. last Thursday indicted or seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as much places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys\nWere named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt there's no doubt\nAt all that the bladder\n... in the hospital regime of Russia be him being the hostile actor that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and the constantly cite cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point\nWe've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nYou know much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's same ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known\nOh Julian Assange is what it is mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D\nThat's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have an hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we got to look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh the OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her\nCan't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it's damning and you're right but you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty sixteen\nNow every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we don't have any doubt that foreign services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously\nYou know it was extremely difficult because I was fighting hands off and on the whole time you know I remember one year or the idea during spring break and my parents helped me a lot they sometimes would come\nAnd get me through flair and a lot of them and of course they get an opera treatment because without it I I wouldn't have done it all and there's no way\nMm folks if you want to talk to any of our guests on the phone number to call into his five a week seven five five zero zero five eight and Irish I Know that you've just got a few more minutes because you've got a clash tonight I'm as you look back on your on your journey so far what tells you about your block tells about you're dreaming piano blogging while you put that together\nWell I started at ducking twenty fourteen right when we were really getting serious about trying to get a diagnosis when nothing with working from I think there's any more and everything I was reading about and just talk about his ...\nUh I couldn't find as much about adults and so [noise] I also I wanted to read something from the first person perspective for someone who's been through it because I wanted to know the enemy okay [noise]\nAnd I realized that that that wasn't out there and I thought well if I have to go through something that that maybe I can make something good come out of the different changes are\nMhm [noise] so you're kinda like um you been injured in a car accident and you're helping somebody else who's injured worse I mean is that yeah I loved it I don't know if that's a good analogy or anything I'm just anything you want to ask her why no just um\nYou know you describe your your your symptoms and is it just seems like an old like sits right I mean and you talk about auto immune and how it affects the the information in it causes that fuzzy and it's just odd I mean we've seen like he when there's a flare up by our children can't cause you can't do math\nThey can't you know the their handwriting goes down it and so it all sex each other so\nYou know again that she's able to um to to overcome that and in in in more college college to successfully it's it's kinda hopeful for problems Irish won ...\nGo ahead and say I think it's great that you're you're going to help people who are our office that thing than that 'cause a lot of parents that are advocating and supporting each other but to have someone that's going to let themselves be there to advocate and help others in\nThe ... ... when you were going through your your use the term flavors um did your voice changed your eyes changed your physical appearance change did you notice any of that\nUh well I didn't notice that is what the people who are close to me say that I just kind of stuck down the light goes from my eyes I usually I'm overly hobby horse and a and I just\nMy own pocket change is on foreign over there is a dark cloud around me\nBut you know if you don't look at me and I think you wouldn't necessarily know that\nI went to ... I was so I Can't tell if I'm not\nI think it really takes that parents and teachers I've been a strong advocate for teachers watching closely because they spend a large majority of time with these children um our students and can see that subtle changes that happen and then um\nMm especially when you're comparing craft the class and you know kind of what the baseline of their skin and you can quickly the when a change in behavior kind of about\n... I was just that but we just have a minute left with you before you gonna run off the class but I'm kind of summarize what you'd like to see happen for the treatment of this disorder in the in the coming weeks months and years\nWell we do we need more awareness or a family and I do because\nHe must leader theater talked about children this order and some of the kids grew up but now they're adult hip hop on perpetuating the net but it only makes it even harder to get a diagnosis when you've been on for so many years\nSo that's something that I think it's really important and all Dr ... wherever we want and two hundred so every\nDoctor has multiple people would panic in their practice whether in order not\nInteresting interesting Irish we promise we would have you off the phone by five fifty is just about that time right now and a Kevin why don't we take our break right now and when we come back I see we have some callers that will take the call and Jim stay with us and Jeff you\nGet to talk further and this is the door and let me show my name's John to be sure we're talking about ... and ... and we'll be back to wrap it up after these words\nHe's been Jordan let\nMe show Iran didn't really care about ... they want as long as you say for the rest of your many to choose which in the middle east says\nOne use radio five eighty and Ninety boy boy ... double duty AG\n\nThey might run by major any more\nThan double duty AG why after denying it for years with ...\nWith Warren stay in Holyoke she's going to take a hard look to the November election at running for president in twenty twenty\n\nWell the two worst Cory Booker he's getting all the national attention from the Kavanaugh hearings smart adjust and she doesn't want democratic voters to forget about both gone to\nPut [noise] seven [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back in ... thanks or engineer Kevin who's um manning the staffing the phones get their meaning the phone to your um\nBecause we've got so many calls you and then all want to get on it was going on a short period of time but I'm a\nDuty you there [noise] [noise] yes I'm right here Judy I'm\nSay what you want to say and um I've got a gym is on the phone with us as well and Jeff I'm but go ahead Judy we've talked to you before and you're you're\nA concerned parent [noise]\nYes [noise] Hi John I'm as you know I have a son who has um can't can't as she can and he was diagnosed at the age of Seventeen\nNow twenty and I just want to tell you is rarely a wonderful herring I with this story\nAnd um I just wanted her to know that when Michael was first diagnosed\nUm there was little awareness and the the area the city of star\nAnd now it's been two and a half that he has had this on that than I feel like the um awareness of the ... thing and spreading fear is still people we meet that given I Know what can Kansas is but there for people now than before\nThat no one can ... so I Am with her with trying to spread out we ended up front especially on Ken Kansas Day\nIn Judy you did so much when you went public with that was the magazine's story a couple of years ago and um you were the one that that got us aware of this\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher\nFor weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot are new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall\nHe hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a ... bill today to fully fund the wall but he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now have record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nThe last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York\nMets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to presidents kept his promises\nOn ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness\nAnd we just let it sit there and we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration a Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered than all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Donald Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dusty a when push came\nShow up in an inner August ... Great Britain but anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside and anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney Perkins who a law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals censor directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in effect you know its application then for the size of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dusty aid that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe ... the application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D. OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes is she was on with Maria birds aroma on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice we're doing the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the buys a warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's embalming here\nThere wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or dusty a on Trump\nWe wouldn't be living through his second year of endless Trump Russia investigation with no evidence whatsoever because Democrats cynically launched the whole thing to ruin Donald Trump's presidency and set 'em up for impeachment\nPlease come and see the commercial side here he takes care of and feed the act we have an engine fast gee [noise]\nThough the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the cabinet issue but the bigger bomb that come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicled by both\nThe deputy director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that's Peters drugs boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was\nIt was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\nMany of you listening today are most likely nearing retirement age and if you haven't thought deeply about planning for your retirement type ... as a method for you that will help you through the process\nMany of you are listening to talk for years um illegal extremes radio program nobody's expert an elder law mistake claiming so if you were just starting or into the retirement process you're going to watch your trust documents to be prepared properly so who's your assets are protected from a nursing home\nIt takes five years to secure the protection and you need to make sure that you aren't wasting your time and your money on legal documents that don't work\nThis month taught has written a brand new guy ... income only irrevocably trust the ... the specific language but must be included and more importantly language that must be avoided and your trust in order to protect your assets from a nursing home\nDid yours for free by calling eight six six eight forty five six nine eight six six eight forty five six nine nine don't delay gave your guy today at eight six six eight for a five six nine nine\nOr downloaded right now from our website legal exchange showed dot com\n[noise]\n\nRain in the swamp ... at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nI twenty five of the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three a and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined\nFort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings of all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told is the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cake if they're in November believe it or not have Ninety eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially at that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hits a North Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was wrong with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting

O. J. face consequences regarding fight that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself\nAnd then when he was talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nI remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel as soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from just after market may they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that roses have a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he gets something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove that confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with ... with the ... I'm sure record talking about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft correct look at this we have the FBI to eating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a pay\nAs well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that drama the FBI the twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to deposed the sitting president the United states is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing\nTheir power and the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker who was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence\nIn support of it ah Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThe weekend comes around [noise] we got the experts to help you hang onto

abuse of power a scandal in American history one\nHas to do with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein member he recommended the firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she'd say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set at Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe use ... pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've guy by the name of Michael ... Smith directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer Warren wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications Sean Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nGreg Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was\nHillary Clinton Russian collusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nTwisting the long ... his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele who had compose this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with the dial aiding investigation\nTo damage Trump and then they violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information\nTo gain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen and they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application and he had known new evidence ...\nBack to the ... the I I Will take a
