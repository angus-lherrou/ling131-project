five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG and double duty ADHD ... this is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG men double duty ADHD Worcester and I urge radio station and\nHigh profile Democrat and CNN the New York headquarters boxes ... has the latest lined\nRepeatedly\nSomeone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious\nPackages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love the show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nCrap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces bidding it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this was a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud or the\nVideo of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal and these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant\nHave the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying\nOut loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob and then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face you know it's an amazing thing that they\nKeep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're\nDoing he's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is\nAnd throws the guy's food out in the street and then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying\nFeinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump calls\nThe news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should've seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list and his policies\nOf the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just just proportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city\nPeople are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nYou know it ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states\nYou want to avoid confrontations\nLike this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chaplain claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package Santa Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus yet in their face holder kick them they go low we pick up\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had\nSimilar incidences of security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent\nThe Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax\nThat was sent don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you\nKnow that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and\nYou know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story but if you go back to three weeks ago how many ... do you even\nKnow that race in letters deadly rice and letters were\nActually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and\nOther top officials in fact that story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin ... heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that ... had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism\nIt was amazing but you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skull leases shooter happen to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know he can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction\nTo this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting lead partisan it just they're so quick to blame ... President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter said that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as\nDoesn't reflect our values spreads fear that doesn't need to be there\nWeren't comments were made friday night during a debate\nSecurity will be tight for the world series extra patrols will be in place in neighborhoods near Fenway Park it's believed a lightning strike sparked a seven alarmed fire that destroyed a historic church in Wakefield last night flames around it any one hundred and fifty year old First Baptist church around seven PM\nAnd

till the all important midterm elections and of course our top story today and we have other issues we're going to get too including new tape that has been a shot undercover that really exposes Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nLiterally the ... she's quote she'll be a super liberal every elected\n[noise] that's what they're caught saying on tape\nYou know she's she'd be bolder if she's reelected and everything else just like Brett ascending Tennessee just like Claire McCaskill in Missouri now we got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people\nIn the states I'm you know it's a and what other things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have these\nThe what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this is going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing a van at the White House\nAnd uh he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice presidents or comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as media outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians\nThey getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that if this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and ... just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt though Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day\nAnd not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen stop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMay have been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they were alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we\nWill spare no resources or expense in this effort and I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning they agree just threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for\nOver a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this what I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative\nOr Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been ... tone deaf and silent to what has

Worcester and I are ... radio station and I argue radio station [noise]\nReport suspicious behavior I leave till the Fox news the highest priority for the FBI that's what director Christopher Wray is saying about the theory the homemade bombs and what's in the high profile Democrats including former Presidents Clinton and Obama and Congress and Maxine Waters of California\nAnd the same with Ted Cruz and his wife we saw it over the weekend with Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao and we saw Boulder being thrown through speaker or or house majority leader Kevin McCarthy office window\nWe told you that last night we've been showing you into the absolute insanity that's been breaking out around the country and we've been playing the rhetoric Corey Spartacus book or get in their face\nHillary Clinton you can't be civil Eric Holder pick them Maxine Waters repeatedly you know create a crowd confront them in restaurants department stores gas stations and I want it anywhere anymore\nAnd now today the media is quite does well let's talk Radio's fault it's Fox News's Paul this is Trump's fault no it would be you know the rhetoric on the left and all these incidents on or you're a single person speak out ever\nWe you know here's a fact nobody right now knows anything about who's responsible for and whether or not these are actual bombs that's not even been confirmed yet\nMaybe they're meant to look like bombs maybe the white powder was meant to look like rice and or or some type of other you know poison we don't know yet we knew that we knew know three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to President Trump\nSecretary of defense Mattis FBI Director race CIA director Gina Haspel that we know anyway former NYPD Commissioner a Bernie ... book by the way it's phenomenal\nThe grave above the grave commissioner of the police department of New York I call him commission\nA dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent his best selling book is out now is called Spygate welcome both of you to the program today the president condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized you know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare and how to an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether anthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case we saw that a lot after nine eleven\nYou know what's on it this kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary a after nine eleven we actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got it a a B. C. N. D. C. I remember get a call from Tom Brokaw she's producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices says and they got them without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie\n[noise] well ... when you detonate stuff or you know you blow to pieces gets harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs took a machine right so now you have a package it's so uh the mail or the the stamps were writing the device little side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to mind the Unabomber remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages ... who's a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the Amazon gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIncentivize as violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs\nAnd there'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually developed\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs to get it was very difficult with this they're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was may have done this\nSo it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that police Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out to John Brennan and then you know an NBC comedies not a CNN country of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were ... enough of the Savage and an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come\nIn rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you out a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City\nWhen you got ... just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false waters of the next two weeks so we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think we can a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here\nUm that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and\nI've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could it be and were Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engage them this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based I going to have an obviously haven't analyze these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be\nA very amateurish devices as the foremost somewhat either\nDidn't know what they were doing a march sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God war\nThey somehow wanted to get caught like we saw on that bombing in ... in Austin but you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost warrant even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre uh this whole cases very bizarre even looked Sean even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversized typing and the pictures the media is put out about these devices I mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff\nDon't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\n[laughter] I mean I'm asking do you agree with that\nWas simple question\nAnd goes no answer because he hung up to harder question Craig you have thirty seconds Greg\nGo\nAhead Greg real quick oh hey Sean great cast to listen to a ... big big honor um I was blessed enough to go to the rally\nOut here in Houston and it was just amazing to hear President Trump speaking person a skinny so much hope because my sister brought my little nephew and a Thirteen year old kid hung on every single word that are present
