category ... storm uprooting trees and downed power lines at least one person has died in the store\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics when he's in Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back to work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to flee the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day well\nI'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility well\nI think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks um and you know we just don't know that but\nYou're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they've built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is written and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish stay just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever ... name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... the psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability\nBlack rifle coffee dot com slash

of fact I I you know and and my dad used to always say to me see if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually is that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks\nThe first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming it could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know yeah right right on the show and\nYou could see the pattern setting up everything got together and that's why you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective I guess is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile camp I that I can find on

I Hope that people are Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that race pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well he's a what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing\nAnd I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee she'd been a longtime friend of this program and recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television and we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nHonestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know isn't iconoclast I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power\nTo turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nGuy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over it\nThe the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world you know they got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in a room that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today and an interview with\nSavannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be several with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nAll over my wife went really tiny scare me [laughter] it was showing you know when they go low we go low we read\n[noise] was just reading about\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and during that ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be several of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick them out Michelle Obama said\nFears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid of the neighbors and you want the main greedy one\nDimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist moms and they are moms\nAnd this this is Rand Paul point out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allowed us to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the ... so called leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nGo on to your friends and neighbors to the doctor whether they're independent or whether they're Republican

strategy that existed\nJust before it leaves a page that nobody had any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter Struck said that there is no there there at all but now we know what the insurance policy was they had immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had\nWhen in fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt or whatever Eighteen months\nThe biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty I used to manipulate not only by the court judges and committed fraud on them\nBut that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lives in the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez the hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like this guy\nAnd then it got used again and again and again they weaponize what turned out to be nothing but at the bumped set of documents that its own author won't stand by\nAnyway why won't Rod Rosenstein now pure under oath before the committees with Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte where's the

districts that is a very very tough but winnable district if you're in what\nDistrict you in ... in the commonwealth her seventh seventh district Sean ... if you're in the seventh district\nAnd the commonwealth of Virginia let me tell you something we need Dave Brat as part of the Freedom Caucus within that's the only group that's been out there fighting to keep the promises that the Republicans made\nYou know for the last seven years and he's been fighting hard every day he's taken a lot of heat for it and now they're thrown tons of money to get him to feed it\nIf you're in the seventh district in Virginia I Hope you go out and vote for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you cut and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein Rona\nHow many ... there there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsked you to come in and testify in this case the chairman of the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to use that remember Rod Rosenstein it and it can from when he goes through his confirmation process you get asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress's question when called is it true that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... ... actually\nA account of someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he's in front of us and if you're not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nThat you're it's hurt both committed perjury under oath or the your your maybe he's the guy who is an apartment and understand the timeline on late night\nKobe is fired based on the Rosenstein memo on basic faith is when he has this conversation with these the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn may sixteen and of course may seventeenth is with Bob ... was named special counsel constantly on what what else happened on his ...\nThey were able to put the ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happened to that as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever knew that there are no we'll get signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline and what we what it's all you want to bring you been asked questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this eh but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by name\nSee below sea and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't went on to pile up the yet the healthcare immigration pact or my opponent is a clerk you're liberal and we're putting the word out but it's like you said are pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and Derek ... big time in doing the right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle\nAnd that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nI should really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just riding on the resistance and out and do vote and that that's why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court ... captain that Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the lap I think the er the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there\nWas an if people want the full list of the the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that ...\nTheir congressmen or a woman who's in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman tried\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply capitalistic when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never got great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who support the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary Nielsen\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the Web has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nList is phenomenal did this the other day show but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced economy going for quaint two percent lowest unemployment ... years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage the ... and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we get up that way\nAnd twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do the things to make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together that they have no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understand that he's not campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein an acting FBI directed his after the firing of coal me Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein in the end McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves with the Russia investigation as as hell are sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYou know I just go back to the way you framed it you on the dot com it's all like you're in Iran over its like specific but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee saying no to the American people and he when he just sat in your remarks\nThat the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that precedent is not good and I'll let him go on with the so it's\nYeah it's not so ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Muller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with\nHis his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nFor why Kobe's should be fired one of the things Miller is looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me you've gotta be kidding me so that guy's gonna oversee this so they both are complex and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other and like you both right neither one of you should be involved in this special counsel any type of over ...\nI don't

really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does exist\nI've talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people to understand their wrapped their arms around the fact that how is it possible that you know communism fascism in in this case that he was writing about not the ...\nIn the last century a hundred million humans souls destroyed\nNow I couldn't put the book down as it tells the entire story of the\nPost war manhunt for these Nazi war criminals that even takes us to modern day and then it's

and it is nice to talk to you welcome back to have you very a very troubling economies we're living in absolutely\nAnd I'm following you closely on TV and radio\nAnd I wrote this book partly because

see people walking into schools gunning down children you've seen thousands shot on the streets in Chicago by drug gangs\nI mean evil is everywhere and we turn away is the Germans prior to World War two we're going to be in for big big trouble here\nWell you know there was a moment and I mean the real history and heroes World War two somebody like you know you compare the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain with the heroic understanding of evil in his time what Winston Churchill\nAnd Winston Churchill and the leader whose warning everybody you've got to pay attention read this book is this man is maniacal murderer and it took him in and I think one of the most courageous stories in history as when Winston Churchill\nDuring the bombing of Britain walking amongst the people of London
