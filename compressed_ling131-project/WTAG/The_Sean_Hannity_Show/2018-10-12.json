chops and never come back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking

know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that has created a tax incentive for business\nTo build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight

deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a big given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to me I agree with you we can find those people you\nAlso talked

uh what do we do strategically when Newt Gingrich no better strategist in the Republican Party is coming up next also project very tosses James O'Keefe while he blew the tendency Senate candidate out of the water with this\nA ship as terrible as it was at least one that was over he's now sitting on the Supreme Court so\nYou know what it man I was just listening to think it was once again as you did with Obama way back in two thousand eight it was Hillary I think you just cut through something really important I think we should describe this year the mask came off\nYeah I think it is I I I I think what's interesting\nI don't know I I definitely feel momentum the polls are showing momentum we now have if we go through all the states is a very tight race how old is up by two out in Arizona Mick Sally believe it or not is now what by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe is definitely going to hurt\nIn the case of of course in cinema\nMarsha Blackburn is up by eight in Tennessee that is such an important race Ted Cruz's rebounded in spite of all the hype of the bed or working all the money that prone against Ted Cruz that it's such an important seat Claire McCaskill is down Heidi Heitkamp is down Joe Donnelly is down\nAnd I think tester is vulnerable in Manhattan I think there's a lot of Senate races\nThat are ... really winnable in this atmosphere where we just watched the Senate all stand in line but for Joe Manchin and follow Chuck Schumer is lead\nAnd remember if if you have that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nAnd the the the the same voters at the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that I think's really important and again I'm I'm thinking out loud to you so because you you trigger the reporting you're doing is triggered this in my own thinking I think our folks do to start shifting towards humor [laughter]\nI I really mean is I think you could take you know I've been here I Am I'm I'm throwing is hard to punch is like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight and then you had any just put your foot off the gas and tell a joke\nNo no no no I once you put your foot on the gas even more but remember as Reagan often proved sometime humor is more devastating that anger he's right\nNow so for example in practice and I I really think marshes attitude Olympic ... it's okay well I understand you're a liberal well understand you're going to vote for humor but don't don't be ashamed of it it's All right\nFor it to you really are and again I think I think it's just something that I learned\nThis in part from from ... great coverage oh John F. Kennedy and in Queens New York in Nineteen sixty or can anyone in this rough but we can before the election just just ripping the Republicans but it was all funny\nIt was all humorous I mean I think my salary for example to take all of these crazy things that are up on her said weave them together into an eight or ten minutes fish will be like a vaudeville act\nIt's OK what can you say in the memory\nBut all of the of the of the world and and\nThe people at Arizona are crazy I I ... I Can't ... I should be over now\nBut think about it a shot in the first thing we should say ... why would you want to be the senator from the capital of the world I mean if you believe the stuff he said why would you want to represent people are crazy what what's wrong with you\nIn life you know and I totally I think I think\nWe should we should accept they really are who they are\nI accept that and I also another thing that the there is no more moderation\nYou know the history of relationships even Tip O'Neill and Reagan I mean those days are long long gone and the era of moderation or a scoop Jackson Democrat or even Joe Lieberman got thrown out of the party Mr Speaker that pretty much says at all\nThat was one of the nicest human beings ever\nYou cannot be a moderate Democrat today in survive a and B because it's getting more and more and more isolated I mean I thought it was very telling that the votes on Kavanaugh you have people\nWho might have had a better chance of getting re elected but they couldn't break with their caucus\nOnly want to do with their donors only one person\nAnd none of that and give them credit Joe mansion ... probably don't managing a you know I'm sure he got the help me out of 'em by Chuck Schumer and company\nThey were desperate for him to not vote because they didn't want it to be bipartisan and that's what his voted\nWell I mean I guess that means he's strong and he's like you're not going to ruin my career because you because of your radical left his agenda maybe even think about becoming a Republican to be wins and that is the one seat that seems safer red state Democrats the only one at this point\nI think that's right I think and and it really even if you watch the even when he voted for governor the numbers narrow the race was closer today than it was a week ago because I think\nWhat's happened is people hooked up suddenly realized what a team sport dishes that you got two teams and then there's a really simple question forever so called moderate and I'd say this I Would also says to mention is he going it was really going to vote for humor\nSome fair question everybody needs to be asked that question that the Democrat\n'cause if it's going to vote for ... why would why would West Virginians send somebody to Washington to take power away from Mitch McConnell in the neighboring state McConnell least understands West Virginia\n[noise] humor as contempt for West Virginia as Hillary Clinton has contempt as just raised tuition go you know you add I'm Nancy Pelosi saying things that were contemptible although ... is a question I'll be opposed to ... why are you able to running\nI Know I go to vote for him or why run\nYou know when you look at things that have been said and I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be civil or\nJoe Biden saying in September of the Trump voters of the ... society\nOr era de mobile deplorable ... or ... or a bitter people\nClinging to their God guns bibles in religion I mean it's pretty obvious where these people are you you haven't had a chance you have to see the bread is an office beat the undercover video project ... I don't know if you saw it on my show last night but\nIt reveals a deep deep contempt they literally calling the people at Tennessee within the office of the Senate candidate from Tennessee they're calling the people's stupid ignorant now I Would say it's over\nMarsha Blackburn will be the next senator from the great state of Tennessee as well Martha ... be the next senator from the great state of Arizona\nI think guys are very high that the way it was starting to build now and ironically it's going to be a red wave not a blue wave you and I only believe that\nI'm not sure that there's enough psycho analyst available for the New York times in the Washington Post and CNN to deal with this if this election comes out the way I think it's going to come out every single one of those uh channels is going to be in such okay trouble psychologically what\nAbout these Republicans in these important house seats to prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker what do you say to those candidates as they now go into their final stretch twenty five days\nI say I'm looking at and it's very similar you know I wrote a paper or would you you kind of have to point out to the Amazon or the two guys need to you know actually pretty straightforward this election is about the future of America One side wants to deliver results and by the way with the with the release of the pasture in Turkey\nToday President Trump is once again delivered for American delivered for religious liberty and for human rights another victory for him and for America or the other side basically just wants to resist and then I take it to a very specific issues I think Kevin McCarthy is in the introduction\nOf a bill to control the southern border that will be voted on in December is really important\nAnd I always say the other side how can you tolerate that much Thirteen and our neighborhoods how can you tolerate fence and all and and opioids fifty four Seventy four thousand drug overdose deaths last year more people we lost an entire Vietnam\nWar how can you tolerate this how can you tolerate sanctuary cities have\nToo many ... John Cox on later I never thought of or Republican would be within ... striking distance in California Gavin Newsom now not only a sanctuary said we talk about it the other day now he wants a free healthcare for everybody you know resident of California non resident legal illegal doesn't matter to go to California free health care for anyone\nBut I think you point out that it didn't quite put it thought about it he said it not only not only has ... willing to take care of everybody who's sick on the entire planet\nBut that also is a great signal for every governor in the state to have a little medicate strip that says by the way if you get sick or your your your your one way airfare to California they would love to take care of you for free\nOr you might have solved forty nine states Medicaid problem in terms of their budgets by just law\nYou know allowing them to send everybody to California I mean there was some plan\nIs worthy of a former mayor of San Francisco it is literally
