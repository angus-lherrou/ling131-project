G. W. Ga Ga HD Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nGiving them the benefit of the doubt I'm Lisa like Sarah Fox news the president saying he spoke with the Saudi king crown prince and they continue to deny any involvement in the disappearance of journalist your market show ...\n... critic of the monarchy went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month a five routine paperwork related to his upcoming marriage and hasn't been seen since\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity outcome that people can use and you also see it Christ in cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject merits house with the tape that they released Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened a governor governor reticent and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important seated in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and and the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response and that's to hurricanes and I remember that that have hit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going\nTo the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama 'cause remember Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday I said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nA fence around her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at at that one one thousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it but her she literally personally changed\nHerself who minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nRight and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then we're going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ... particularly when ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are ready at Trump rallies and twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that\nSo yeah ... gets hurt him to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a girl born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategist they're prepared the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps the\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent\nUnemployment below four percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer loving missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with capital as well even the CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters members\nOf al ... who was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America\nGreat again or keep America great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like it did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate that can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to

it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call radio a warmth medium\n... you're exactly right you're exactly right look shutting the reason that cop was that was on your program yet they fight a clip from Hillary Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility\nIn this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion selling us telling the American people\nThe only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up if Democrats\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nSince the day Donald Trump\nWon the left in this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them\nYou know wanted anywhere anymore okay\nWell that sounds like you want something bad to happen and the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOf ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters ... said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because then you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it's\nSad that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian toss the a ... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThis is who they are there's nothing that they're running on the tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said that we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe it maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when maybe they lose the house you lose the house\nThen all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeach but\nThat's the agenda that's it\nThere's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... and so there's a lot of states [noise]\nI think the ... the healthier within the media and I don't think it's just the United states but I think it's around the world\nThat the meteor overall wherever it is is under attack and are there a ... a former governor there called the fourth estate or they don't like this is recorded in the constitution\nAnd the the threat to the media I think is a threat to our democracy and I think the media both I listen to a bar sensibly and I listen to all the others and they've all been mostly in agreement\nThat this is the threat of a threat to the media in any form shave a tray perform is a threat to a an ability to report what goes on around the world and and the film in our country and democracy is a threat to democracy\nSo I don't think it has much to do with um a or anything else I think the media is aligned themselves around the issue out of fear for their own lives when they go into countries of a report story and we don't ever want to have the address diminished we may not agree with what the president saying ah they may be a lot of bias now in our own country\nBut that without depressed I think it would be a total destruction of democracy\nBut why Paul's and if you if you write a new very well may be because there's an interesting take a but if you are right why isn't this getting the same attention all over the world that is getting in the United states\nWhy are they getting the same attention yeah because I think for the\nSame reason I think that it that caught the you've got to remember where the most powerful nation in the world\nBut it's not getting the same attention in Europe\nYes it is if you live and as I have apparently the the ... the massive amount of media attention from all over the world covering this story from what I have a hearing and I say I want it to the on a daily basis\nAnd people were saying people say is being fed by the Muslim Brotherhood [noise]\nWell I I haven't heard much about the Muslim Brotherhood involved\nThe basic foundation of this or he is the that threat and the attack on the media and the man that's a very good things on Donald Trump admitted abundantly clear them to voice is the most powerful voice in the world that the ... the enemy of the building that I'm\nA circle the author of the ... as as a as worth his music the area\nRight take ... very good input I appreciate it was very very much is\nNice to have another take on this thing

Ga Ga HD Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nFirst he managed to after visiting the consulate he had lived in Saudi Arabia he's not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council and it can be hurt on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate this I'm only telling you what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday a head of a plant search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe into ... disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show ... but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nThe source told the site that his death took seven minutes runs a physician doctor Salah Muhammad al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president hairdo on and the Turkish foreign minister\nAfter ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts adapt to the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman Solomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time I\nAm a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception to the ... who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nAnd I think what's happened clearly is the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saturday constantly wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka\nFormer White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending\nThe feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contribute a Thirty Years' CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis\nAssassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions\nOr I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between\nTwo nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate\nThis man was a journalist wasn't and Americans that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common pay ... you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Bruce Bruce brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the consulate\nUm we do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly this numbering ... body after he was killed or what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and we gave them the orders and then to prove that they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concerns what will get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they\nNeeded a void speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary if I'm paying with needing enjoying its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the rainy and had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean if you don't make perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like on a fixture self domestically it is the author of the ... the uh over the perfect on on the truth is short we have a lot of a matter of rich or with

you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and
