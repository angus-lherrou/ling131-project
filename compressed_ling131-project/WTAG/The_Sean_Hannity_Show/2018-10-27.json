these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess a spacious devices because we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe going to make sure that that's been confirmed 'cause they when they said they had powder I'm assuming that was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot to chart a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him well\nIt's a different tact than you hearing from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um that bomb threats what I'm concerned about is\nAs he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the stick to the jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Arlen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between now is that the vigilance could there be more than one person involved in this whole\nScenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the Tom family was threatened as well\nAs it and I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of ... I've I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having strong political views it's it really is unfortunate\nUm but that's why I think\nWhat we should be able to be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and apparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place\nOn this man this guy this background we have to find out if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together or people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you\nOr we can yeah well we ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters and China I Want to say one other thing to do with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting reported much it's how many people are sick and we have children dying\nFrom early on like illnesses now so what talk in the brain and that's another issue I you know I'm concerned about [noise]\nWell look we got we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have some brilliant scientists and doctors that work endlessly out a long hours every day that the save us\nAll right we've got to take a break hey listen I Will tell you that my pillow changed my life it just works I Love it I Can't be without it I fall asleep faster I I stay\nEarn your degree on line from her\nRenovations breach\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoins secure innovations for cocktails and conversation with just dumped on Baltimore's championship feeding as limited reserve yours today on secure innovations Facebook page\nLet's get back to our busy bones eight hundred nine four one\nSean as a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program Jim is in Nebraska and Jim do you feel like I Do that I felt conned supporting Ben Sasse and and I think ... the people in Nebraska um how do you feel about you live there\nYeah I'm not real happy with that uh when he was campaigning he\nYou know if I remember correctly you know Ted Cruz came out was campaigning with him in a ... maybe even Sarah pale and I don't remember for sure but you know everything he sounded like everything that he believed in was exactly what Donald Trump is doing his very best to try to accomplish and it seems like\nIf he had his way we wouldn't have any success that we've had the last two years but because he was never Trump or and you\nKnow now he writes a book any devotes twenty pages of is failing book against me and you know lo and behold nobody wants to buy his book as I predicted and I just think it's amazing because when he was running he was begging us to put them on the air as often as we could and we even put an audio out of him praising me\nAt the almost daily so I guess\nYou know he says now I'm Bad for America but I was pretty good for Ben Sasse in America at the time that he wanted to use these airwaves every day to get his message out\nYeah and you know I'll tell you at least in my district which ... which is about a three quarters of the west end of the state of Nebraska I'm that's Adrian ... district I'm Ben Sasse is not real popular right at the moment I'll just put it that way\nYeah well look I I personally feel like on a level doesn't happen to me ... very often he said everything that I thought would would make a great senator and lead the great people the ... and all I've seen since ... you know a guy go to Washington get full of themselves\nVery arrogant ... are very angry guy with a very quick temporary confronted me once but anyway I'll give you the last word go ahead what's what else is on your mind well\nI'm with the package bombs\nDevices are I think this is kind of um something that a showman the media and some on the left have kind of been wanting to happen um with their insightful language or Cory Booker telling people to get in Congress many spaces\nI'm Nancy Pelosi she comes out and she says if there is a collateral damage on the side of those who are against us well then so be it I'm In ... bomber himself when he was telling a people are killed her to get in their families in Britain spaces\nAnd let them know what about\nAll I got to run here but Logan let you go thank you so much for your call eight hundred number one Sean is our number if you want to be a part of the program quick break right back uh will continue a lot more news to get to straight ahead\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nGuy seeming temperatures will be in the mid thirties for Saturday rain likely all day with high in the mid forties said you know the rain continues temperatures drop into the lower ...

don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others they say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and emulate it so you know they said well we don't like that some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you\nSay they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message\nJust rent cream tell him as a message to let them in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor it would do with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because just starting to see that this was a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN MSNBC that's starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this or we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we\nHad an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the left is authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political corps you and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're

the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate has gone I mean ... ... all all

thousands of families\nWill be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the ... of American businesses will lose hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them as the president is Americans don't want to do the work wage jobs can't buy American workers to do the work was the president that is a crime in many instances that's just not true in\nMy view from a citizen and\nThe DACA program or some eight hundred thousand young people in the crew and most ugly presidential are in the modern just three of this country I cannot

at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of this uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing\nTowards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us in a way of horrible people uh especially when the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico and Mexico obviously didn't have the will lower desire to do anything in this case\nAnyway appreciate the call eight

outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out up on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the Caribbean

and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicting so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we've got a very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the ... President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says they're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get\nA you know ... on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse so you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody ... charm ... will get their answer possible\nDon't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by ...\nThe measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages about five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months that is a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind went to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nSean short list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot just ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela like that\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success [noise] many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America the hardest African American\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I don't know if Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built these this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is

background or experiences pretty unbelievable here also watching an Arizona this caravan are headed right towards our southern border has become well a big big issue we have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back I'm\nKristin ... calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake yeah\nThat blind shake involved in the ... the what the bombings that America\nUm she's had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha mix Sally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked be asked to stay at home moms ... off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home leech off their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do a bike too uh but uh I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that you're opposed to going to go higher\nThan well ... it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and your extreme as on so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are are turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona\nValues and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step\nPast this qualifying statement you know compared to me serving twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had\nSix deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolutely honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse than send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's

amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nAt speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in the battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this is what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the
