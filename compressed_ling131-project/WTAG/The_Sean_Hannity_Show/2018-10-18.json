a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American\nLineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts slant solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want or lack of somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a

beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think I think he is the fourth\nA cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments oh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nI think that's right and it's partly because if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly\nThat they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and Carol than I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators incentive meetings\nI think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein\nBut Lucy San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost\nTwenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala only four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on Romney distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of illegality the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nState or data and ... and this nationwide contests and bills to two hundred two hundred\nI
