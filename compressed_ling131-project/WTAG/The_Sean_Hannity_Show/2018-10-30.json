president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nUh a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special\nConsideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis ... senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column both my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question on the Mark I'm in the actually that's a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the mark\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad in our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a ... mountain seemed to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come in according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are affected really don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nWhat I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their families that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people\nAnd

the reason why I'm calling and I appreciate your taking my call but the reason why I'm calling is I I think you Rush Limbaugh and went back down playing this red wage I don't think it's the right way and I think it's a rich nominee Democrats are getting fed up with the lives and they ended up just the deception\nOr you know okay Larry and all that and that's really getting sicker than ... uh like didn't mean Trump so I think they just they just want to silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats ... if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota\nFlorida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house\nAnd that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and win at all what are the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that\nFor the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight

five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians dissent among can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exact even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santa's is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe leaders stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mansion is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing as very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners\nFor Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue is to me are simple what we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascend in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and when the media had two snares out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president we have the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterms think about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease it regularly watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent goes to talk about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to ... some people in November six\nI don't care what nationality and religion you are a color you are a but I also understand that there are people out there that are sick and whether they're sick because of their um that uh you know a a psychiatrist can help 'em or a or their\nThe difference between me mentally ill and being dangerously mentally ill is not knowing what you're doing\nA basically that's probably not a very good explanation but\nWhen you're arrested in or you name or a lawyer claims that you are mentally ill ah your defense has to prove that you don't know the difference between right and wrong and if you know the difference between right and wrong then even your mental illness is not in the shoes for your actions\nSkies they killed these people in the city argued Pittsburgh\nWas not mentally ill and if he's mentally ill he knew the division right wrong 'cause he knowingly went into this and they got to kill Jews\nHe said she'll be for research so afterwards he's such a with his writings such orders a traumatic media he knew exactly where to go he knew exactly what he was going so the difference is you know the difference between right and wrong not whether you can control yourself\nOh you're in danger to yourself and other people know that most people don't live in a Unabomber up a cabin in the middle of Oregon somewhere when nobody knows you exist\nMost people that are committed mass murders up people who neighbors have seen on things going on the Florida no a nightclub shooting neighbors sausage going on in the garage\nBoxers coming in people coming in people that didn't look like they belong there nobody bother calling the Assad regime is nobody wants to get involved\nMaybe just maybe if someone took a time to call a hotline or ... or ... just maybe someone with a fall when it up maybe some and whatnot but maybe that could have been avoided\n\nThe Adam Lanza thing people knew he was sick\nNo it was a danger to himself no he had to go into an institution but the system was so broken the show and and it in malfunction so badly by the time you try to get someone put in under custody of the costs\nBecause we're so confined in our mind you was it was was rights but how about the victims the potential victims so now you have victims nobody supports them\nWhen are we going to reverse that somewhat and just understand that we have to do some things to uh to protect us and Iran palatable things you know I remember when uh we were attacked on September eleventh two thousand and one\nAnd the Patriot act came in and and are under George Bush and it was passed by the Congress I had tremendous reservations to the Patriot act I really didn't like it at all I didn't like that I had to give up some of my freedom\nBut I was willing to swallow the bitter pill\nIn order to stay alive my families stay alive in for this country to do what it has to do\nShall we gave up a little bit for me to have him on\nThe right to live in freedom without fear and trepidation we've got to start looking at those things we did not taking away our rights\nBut justice asked it moved swiftly and people have to start getting involved not driving\nBy the scene of the action was stopping at the action\nBefore the action curse maybe authorities have to look at these types of people if someone would just make the phone call that someone's asking very strange\nYou know I I was out what is this guy the other night and all they did was talk about Jews Jewish Jewish how we hate Jews and how Jews ought to be killed and just maybe a knock on the door by the authorities no there's no law against you ...\nYou can have me there was no are against that you can be an anti Semite there's no law against that but if I if you hear me threatening and I'm going to do something a phone call may have just way that this guy from taking any action maybe not\nMaybe they would have found out this guy had the money oh gosh\nMaybe not but maybe\nIf we decide that we're going to be part of this community instead of being outside\nAnd not want it to get involved going home at night hitting the buzz on\nThe door opens up in your garage you drive your car and you put the bus down you put down your shades your mock all you're doing is three locks you sent your mom and you don't know what's going on around you\nYou don't talk to your neighbors you don't know who they are and you don't want to get involved was long as we have that kind of an attitude ... for these types of attacks will be back\nJordan and let me show you just sit in your right hand towels postulate on you lie about what the real world's all about\nTaste the real world a little bit on Youth Radio five eighty and Ninety four boys ... W E a G [noise]\nHave my friends joy and love it here for Jordan's turkeys in ... and not my church east and it's not my turkey for its Jordan was Turkey's though and it's a fifth generation family run ... right here in our backyard and Roman\nNothing says family tradition more than sitting at the Thanksgiving table with the best turkey over has I promise you will be its lean is tender as juicy and best of all fresh turkeys ... faster so sleep all new\nOkay you know if we get up early and while you're artery or Jordan jury you don't forget you can order fresh baked pies breads roles and gravy one stop shopping is giving at Jordan's turkeys in Rodman you haven't tried one of the turkeys yeah no no what you miss it\nNow is a time for you to audio find fresh turkey today I'm joined us turkeys in Rodman ... eight eight six to five nine five or on line that Jordan turkey is not top\nThis Thanksgiving enjoy your farm fresh turkey from Jordan turkeys in ... in front\nOf my friends we are back you just got a couple of civility before we wrap in Damascus will be tomorrow when I Wish him well you have to have a little\nProcedure but he'll be back with us a whole meal friday but no later than Monday show 'em but he's doing real good and um [noise] so um\nI don't want to oversimplify these things that we that we've been talking about because they're not easy answers nobody has an easy answer there are no easy answers but doing nothing is not an answer\nAnd that's what we've been doing doing nothing we have done nothing sides on your on this side you're on that side how 'bout the how about the right side the right side would be the side of the people inside of not flip the coin\nSo although this immigration is is it is a problem um the ah anti Semitism is a problem uh the violence is a problem none of these are easily fix\nBut all of them can be fixed\nAll of them can be fixed if we just decided to do things differently than we do we not because what we're doing now is nothing thrown a heads up on the air all yelling and screaming about it\nHow long we've been talking about the migrants marching from El Salvador and yet we don't have a plan at the border yet because of\nFive six hundred troops are nine hundred truth whatever five thousand troops that's all we got we don't have a plan now maybe they have a plan and I tell her about but there's gotta be a point I Would be telling them ... those people with a plan\nI Would tell them that it's going to get arrested and I go to go into a village of tents and they go to stay there on their prosecuted then they called me back to where they came from\n\nMaybe there'll be thinking of scratching their head when they're in Mexico saying well if that's going to happen to us when we hit the United states and they've got the manpower at the border to do this and they've already built the tents\nA congressional candidates and very important districts it's interesting all up there are four hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple of seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations\nAnd one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think anyone I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you\nStill have a job to do and if you want to ... to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics as the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican rock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue you get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only are they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans have been set up because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe experts such a short us a hundred percent certainty and twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four teams\nIn terms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it\nWith a nine feet Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we\nThought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media\nAnd they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea you\nShould do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're\nGoing to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is all white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe GOP claimed they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats\nThat's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing laws but Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nProtected so that when it's time for you to retire your assets\nCan be there to work for you retirees have to worry about a lot of things will your money

American companies are unaffiliated\n[noise] [noise]\n\nHi one week from today the results come in but I just going back to Nineteen days before the Republican Senate landslide in twenty four teams what Nate Silver is five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much if Democrats eked out victories in those states\nAnd picked up the seat in Kansas they can control fifty seats and keep their majority Democrats also pick up seats from the G O P in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but far from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't win a single state according to the polls John Kerry was going to be president because of the polls\nNow I don't have a crystal ball and\nI just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district check out my website see if you're in one of those key pivotal\nTip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every

Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida\nAnd I'd love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is that a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release where that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York y'all get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of happy now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that would never reported what you need to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks so CYA so it'll be interesting to\nReport it at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and in in a response to the subpoena uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do that\nSaying if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago it was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently\nIt's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark and er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum pick this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah\nGillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a free tax to be able to do a disproportionate response of\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organizations that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said to us as the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed\nBy Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me there's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... and the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them out of government single plan so it really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose businesses and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nThey'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and they also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish men a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background that looks like almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate\nUm they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents that release after he lied in the debate last Sunday or the media is kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just weren't Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery of thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the pan handle so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want a vote in this election but this loners they're home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot\nYou know the bad news is that you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend a which we weren't sure could happen that quickly\nUm and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm a ... the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah look I mean it it's got to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm going to have to deal with it and take off were request off I Will say though\nUm had that gone forty miles west of the population would have been much bigger\nI'm so there is damage and its extensive damage\nBut I think can damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple areas that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I will be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force base Iran is an important not active duty ... so I'm really pleased that that is going to be fixed\nI got to take a quick break we'll come back more with Florida gubernatorial candidate Congressman Ron dissent this on the other side might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nLot of money I was trying to find an alternative to smoking I think one of the tech magazines wrote an article on

evening temperatures will be in the lowest thirties for Wednesday mostly sunny with a high around sixty degrees when she had the clouds coming Los dropping to the upper forties EPA Thursday mostly comedy maybe a chance of rain with high in the lower sixties you can get your forecast anytime a W Gigi dot com keyboard weather\nOh\nRight as we continue with former congressman now gubernatorial candidate the all important state of Florida Rhonda Santa's going up against radical leftist Bernie supporter Andrew Gillum just as a way of background you did go to Harvard how many years did you serve the country\nI was active duty for five years in a U.S navy\nYeah um you know I I look at Florida they'll they had a little bit of a red tide problem is not something that happens sickle ugly over long periods of time occasionally\nIt got its natural I think the issue we've had is Lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges\nFeminist polluted water into the rivers and so I write who's the ... river goes into the area where you where you live in South Florida and I think what happened with some of those nutrients mix with the red tide and exacerbated so we we got it bad that was already got a really really bad\nSo I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that stopping to discharge it got in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnership I'll be able to do that you'll and wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that I think any of those problems we had an eye on her\nGo but I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess the early part of the spring and summer of this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I'm not quite frankly Michael watched I'm a bit um you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two mile stretch there in South Florida where\nPeople were just getting hammered it was in that ... that there were fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we need to do whatever we can but a lot of it as a fault you know the federal government are discharging you know all this water under the river\nA round the Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida a Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states as Florida always is I'm a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically but Florida\nI Hope people are waking up to the fact um and you are you how you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nOtherwise I think I'm On packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense but my friends and put out I got\nAnd I look I mean we're we're going to be squandering\nEven angry business taxes forty percent forget it I'm Out\nI now I Know now that's exactly right so we're going to get it done I think the folk to understand that and uh you know when I'm governor will be able to do about it I got her on track record year\nRound the Centers for governor of Florida thank you for being with us seven days to go until election day best election coverage continues

district and there's been an influx by the way uh he's been in office by the way since ... twenty Fifteen\nRunning against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill and a ton of money now we see millions and millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg\nWho is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job for the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat\nA Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted at a tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money is being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of hot sauce in New York City because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nOr that's not something my eye on it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nYou know what are your home that I think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now I kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can uh he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people getting wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male [noise] um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox [noise]\nNow do you have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are\nYou know we're putting on our message we're putting on our message on what I've done and ah how complex thanks for this district and people like that so\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen\nRight now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you liked the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about\nYou know what it matters or we're going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment we're\nGoing to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats are we going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned early is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like\nYou're the same people that ruined the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats to vote for ... polo see any Democratic Senate vote as a boat for Schumer\nThen we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program
