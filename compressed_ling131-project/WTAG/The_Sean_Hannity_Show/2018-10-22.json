Know you've got a counselor smarter than I\nDo get a city council meeting tomorrow night to hopefully they're going to have a recommendation back from the economic development committee about the ... district for the ballpark\nA that's an important piece to kind of put in place uh I'm actually going up Thursday to meet with four of the architects a lot of them are in the Boston area so I'm going to go meet in the studios and talk to them and really this is an important decision we want to make this decision very thoughtfully I'm so get a chance to do some of that\nUm [noise] and you know there's multiple fronts or in terms of economic development that we're working on I had a group and today talking about the main street project to\nUh the redesign they showed me the\nUm [noise] lay out for the Carol plaza in front of the Hanover theater a that's going to be a cool space that's not only going to be able to serve as some outside dining for the new restaurant Josephine so it's going in there there's going to be a water feature in a a a\nLight feature there that's going to be a piece of public are in and of itself so when you come to and from the theater\nAnd as part of our discussions with the end of a theater they're going to take the responsibility for\nThat really a newly designed space there's going to program that space out in front so they're going to have outside activities and events there when the theaters not happening so during the day or ... history dot stuff my diet and things like that that will really you know they have the conservancy next door so they get a lot of kids who are down there doing stuff\nSo activating that street skate that's really one of our big principles activate district get people's sitting outside eating get people outside watching a performance push carrots [noise]\nYou know all the stuff we've been trying to do on the common let's stretch that out mechanics class or a where the foothills there used to be a in front of the ah Hanover were\nAs part of the main street we're going to redesign the Space Needle mechanic saw eye to create more apt to space in front of the old AT and T. building we'd been working with them about a\nA R installation on the side of the building um that would really activate that space than if you're familiar with that this kind of a big\nKind of inlet there and that could be a really cool space or for some different plant things and some different activities so we're trying to be really thoughtful about every ... cranny and activate it how do we not have it just be a dead space but an act of\n... a lot of housing coming down ... percent of the of the canal district in Dallas and how he got a lot of people that are now with the neighborhoods expanding yep I'm and I'm a young vibrant of expansion and you know different ages there's something for everybody now you've got to get\nA retail activity and the other ... ... people can't find rest wrench coffee shops the editor\nOr just a nice stroll around ... or whatever that people were I had a different kind of venue that they like to go to our variations of venue\nSeeing less than a year the central building or will be filled up with people living their school or with retail on the first floor or some group just purchased the on what Adams building there doing housing upstairs and bringing retail back to the old elm what Adam ...\nThey ... they were just pawnshop building an adult version of that a lot of prop ... he he he has a very big portfolio now he's also our building or the Carol building the ...\nAnd then you've got a case in allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements that his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here is what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida and through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the census the thought of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nThe elements use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views is trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett us that and the project birds as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa season to fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Bredesen is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office\nSaying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but\nSome anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nOf the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to\nWhat we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes even his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate\nHave faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it meant treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have a top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom Perez was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi whereas her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nCan see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee\nBlack um ... Marshall mixed Martha\nSally wins in Arizona where we have Dean Heller holds the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian is siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nWhen Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know a crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nThe caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now services that sports that appears for the care of on as they're now battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah ... for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspaper say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others still wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers\nBecause you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appear it but they appear confident that this confrontation is going to come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans in stink to believe don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid for Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nBy the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to Martha ... much more straight ahead

estimates cited by L. universal a\nMexican newspapers says the caravan has now grown to fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others wage that's part of the story of the president now has alerted the military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S\nSouthern border I mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle mountain wrote a book years ago called invasion the American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is there a moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the Daily Caller has a piece\nOut saying that the majority of people in the ... not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above\nA caravan hers is comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know behind a chain link fence at the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to\nCross into Mexico and this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated\nBecause Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports as even helping the caravan or make their way to our southern border\nResident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there around you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and a report friday said that they met people from ... dash\nAre joining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating ... Mahler in Mexico the British has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders and Central America not as strong as the U. S. which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nOr said a ... on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country and yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to\nUnderstand here and there is a political thing having been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego helicopter horseback\nBoats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there I saw it in the entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me uh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that have that have been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nWallace this on our borders lawlessness\nWhich sanctuary cities and sanctuary states you know I sat through that briefing with Rick Perry weapon to see this weekend I

National Guard in order to make sure there's\nAlways what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now I it's almost like we're headed towards a major human confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty\nUm no I I think Democrats ally go in the back of their heads hoping this happens so all maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I prayed not\nYeah same here but I Will tell you one on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras who came here legally and when that lady comment is that the Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said\nI'm In I'm sick of this kind of stop she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd and motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem that we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront and either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now hearing Kissinger was shouted down and listen to some of this [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYou\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries\nYou know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you you clear the crowd you confront them\nYou do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country you know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is is wrong and they get this is not how not her eighty decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is did is to send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNot is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea that it will show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never left\nThis isn't new to this is the way it looks and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong\nAnd just let me ask you this and this great nation off or\nHow does the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing this this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that are mixed in with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safe is for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't want to see people the president doesn't want to see that\nBut you can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats once a quarter because I think deep down they want the politics of this you see they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them\nHow they're have their case it due to cater to that we can find out or they legitimate or they're really fling something are are are are they coming here to do harm are they part of the game what's their background each it takes some time to do that but it takes resources it takes people\nBut if the Democrats won't allow us to pass the legislation that would put all that in place so we can get a answers quickly are much much more in a in a much more quicker and better that we do today that's the problem so quit playing politics let's solve problems and let's do it in a way that's consistent with the rule of law\nOr we'll talk more about the election Jim Jordan is with us from Ohio he'd like to be the next speaker of the house also\nUh we'll get to that we do have some deep state news we haven't touched on yet Martha ... Sally use running against this radical Democrat Christ in cinema out in Arizona I mean every day there's a new revelation about how crazy she is\nUm meaning Christian cinema a Scaramucci is going to join us also go over some house races with you that are\nDefinitely in play as we now are Fifteen days out of an election have your like Lyndon you're Twenty years old and you go on a vacation of a lifetime and\nFirst major gas or watch where your vote will decide who went over twenty categories like crying comedy use force curiosity and more cash yourself and you're automatically qualified to join us in person for the first ever I heart radio ... live in Los Angeles January Eighteen now and I I tend to wars dot com\n[noise]\n\nAs we continue Jim Jordan is with US Congressman Ohio wants to be speaker why are you so confident that the Republicans hold the house I have a lot more confidence in the Senate I just can't get paid a post on motivated people are and the districts the Seventy districts that matter that\nWe had to buy the balance of power Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Minnesota Michigan Ohio where you are California of all places Minnesota of all places those congressional races seemed to be with a power imbalance will be kept\nYeah I mean I mean I have a a company that one I think Americans have common it they don't want to go with the the radical vision that left is offering I think a second we have good candidates\nTake Chicago a Peter Roskam district for Apple shot here's got Iraq that was one in two thousand and six year we actually lost a house he beat Tammy Duckworth and now us a senator from the state of Illinois he beat her in that election Peter Roskam knows how to win so we have good candidates across the country who I think know how to win and these top top climate\nBut again I think when you look at where the left wants to take this country I think most people with comet that's got to say I didn't sign up for that I'm going to keep Republican control and the great economic gains that we've seen under the leadership or the ...\nDo you think the cabinet and hearing the caravan the mobs um coupled with the president's success ... is is there a base out there that we're not hearing from the polls are picking up yet\n[noise] I think that's very likely I mean we haven't necessarily seen it we haven't really polled but when you anecdotally around talking with folks you sense that you feel that that people are in fact moving a in that direction and and were outraged by what they owe happened to a judge capital\nAnd what are the your house members it Freedom Caucus guys how's Dave Brat and doing it now we're going to actually talk to Scott Perry at the last half hour how are those guys do any of their in their new operations there\nThey are they're doing great but I'll give you the best examples by law it was down like twelve point three weeks ago he's now that it was in one point that's what happening because our guys are working hard good candidates working hard and the American people are waking up to the ridiculous positions that the left wants this country too\nRight Jim Jordan thanks for being with us when we come back we'll we'll check in with congressman Perry we'll get to some of your calls in the next hour Martha ...

term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of Pennsylvania's Supreme Court decision\nOr they decided read ... draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nAnd that's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting doesn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have obviously they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it a to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you kind of highlighted some of the things they're doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan and keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for messing it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but\nYou know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill out of a you know the ... the replacement for Obamacare 'cause if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know what and talk to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell let's all hardly they tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone and I mean ... ... all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law to habits or penalized if they
