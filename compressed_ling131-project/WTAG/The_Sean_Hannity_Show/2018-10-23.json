Sally is going up against Christians cinema Christian cinema seems to be floating out there of will get the state of the race has the best election coverage continues Fifteen days till election day

look groups would accuse us border patrol or the miracles groups\nAnd when ... was was a liberal for you to\nArizona and in that class [laughter] man for the state house in the Senate\nI left and your son is in the spring and\nMy mind to make Sally and I approve this message\nAre we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now blood you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour that was put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience was pretty unbelievable here also watching an Arizona this caravan are headed right towards our southern border has\nBecome well a big big issue we have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back come\nFirst instead of a once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake you know that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America\nUm she had no problem with Americans joining the Palo bond\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for reaching off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks for some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do it by too uh but uh I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christians send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nSon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona and your extremism on so many issues as being an earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values are you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know a huge served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron and combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground\nAnd defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban are nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way\nAs the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nSome people do something when they were elected and run on their record All right let's talk to Bill Bill\nUnknown Jordan Hawaiian bill I'm fine I Would question you may\nThey may pay for about Trump or lying about tax cuts when now now we're talking about middle class that isn't initiate it yet\nRight I said I and I said that I don't believe that will happen is what I said\nWell one person that go to the house\nLast year was asked me bill do I believe that Donald Trump's ten percent tax cut\nHe didn't say that I'm a if Congress passes this it'll happen he said the middle class and going to get ten percent tax cuts and I'm saying that I don't believe that's going to happen\nAnd I don't care what reason it is when the people don't vote for it or he doesn't have the house or doesn't have the Senate and you know he's chance to go out and make these statements unilaterally without a caviar that\nHe showed a politician on them and they're always nice so what's your problem that that that that not well I don't know why is it a lab what I said what is it\nIf if if it's a lie if you if you can't do it did have some I\nHow do you know we can't do it because you just said he could can overheat than a lot of really how's he going to do it\nWhile I'm not that you know I'm not a CPA here you know a show yet\nThat idea of what you get a deal with the deficit is right now\nUh yeah about ... trillion yeah\nIt went up in the last two years\nYeah well and and um it doubled to ...\nAnd that we're not talking about Obama bomb was gone was tonka out and and and it's talking about running much talking about Trump right now I'm all for this last or not at all I was on for the last couple of the tax\nCut didn't do it did not regenerate the cash back to pay down the deficit because you can't increase spending on the sides and pay down the deficit now that's one of the Trump that's just common sense\nBut some of that some of that are added on to the national debt because of the fence because our military with one down\nFrom what's really behind with you so you're gonna have you're going to have an increased deficit so at what point you at what point do you stop telling people that you're going to give them tax cuts and pay down the debt\nAh knowing him an audience economically you know I Believe the ten oh okay\nI Believe when you get when you when you find out how call me and let me know because I Want to notify me all my friends aren't a judge hold on we'll

two years ago well the fourteen states that now have record low unemployment I think I Would say the size decisively yes\nOr or record low record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets and youth unemployment\nAll setting record low numbers\nThat's great for the American people\nWe have better trade deals than we've ever had

about impeaching forty five\nI Would say if I had to guess my best after all this study and that I Do every single day and all the polls I look at every day\nI don't have a feel for which way the

are you\nI'm I'm doing great and uh I'm In Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you they are do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way Hillary Clinton\nWould have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump her now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation\nWith his own name on it alone that he sponsored sorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is the never Trump\nOr his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and idle and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he I mean yeah I talk to them at a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThen you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks them from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico and if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be a that Mexico that decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision you just have to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons\nAnd that block\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're gonna have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do what we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best foot plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans ended up with their own political reasons doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't cave what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact create or an effect on human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow than actually going to have what what could be but it down as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people 'cause they ask keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point we we have a real to send them and this is this is what Lincoln saying over and over again yeah ah you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union\nAnd he didn't say it happily he didn't say that excited Lee ... many of his key early speeches and this nostalgic sadness to them\nOr that we're bound together by the common core of mystique memory and that we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost pleading no don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nThe perfect crossroads to make the decision are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the end and people blocking U.S forces to cave\nIn guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like what you think of Nate Silver as a production and much more of a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is our guest eight hundred nine four one showing us a

agile drama midnight Texas returns for seat in too many central on NBC\nYour TV tipped off on my heart radio talk\n\nFormer speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is\nWith us they don't need silver didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans pick up seats in the Senate I don't have a spiel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona for shore North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nWhile the ... but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going ... um you know most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are well within about two points when the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not spending much money and I'm we're not campaigning and I'm when I'm making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied the generic ballot\nAnd and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter should two things happening you see this little bit with Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um\nAnd and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think you also\nMay drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because the Keith Ellison is just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where the whole what do you know for example when\nWe talk you know ten days ago you and I work but this was a race between jobs and marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and do you watch the Democrats\nTo ask you can you know they could you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out of there because it's the true important wherever fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets\nAnd you're either going to have great news all the way around maybe it's going to be a split decision or you're gonna have horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you've been shocked the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome I quit break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more

longer explanation us said Kavanaugh caravan are going to be the defining issues and the next fourteen days people will vote fourteen days from now\nI Would add to that caravan Kavanaugh\nThe mobs we now you saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy how say through a Boulder through the window I'm at you saw what they did the Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing league claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force to a former attorney general saying when the Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people ah and drive them out of public life or you can remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFor the banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house\nSo significant people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of\nThe legitimacy of of the modern of American government which the left passionately believes uh I I think that you're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment is\nThese aren't historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics\nHere was historic we're we're going to get a solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be smeared and parents were assassinated and lied and manipulated and brown beaten into backing down so that was that was a historic moment so we'll have an effect for the next forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers rightness or do you have to fourteen thousand\nIf this caravan can get into the United states how big is the next caravan and the shower then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event here the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion\nOr and if we don't trust me that it will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly where they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's where I go\nWell and remember because we we we shouldn't have to have a showdown about this there's no such thing as a ... state\nTo be a ... state you have to decide to your state can in fact imposed on the federal government activities which it cannot possibly impose and at some point we're going to have a big collusion with ... century stage because there are a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um\nI have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that the way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly in the cabinet case you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never recovered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores followed them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker\nNor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nOppression and those other countries and a very bad situations but we have the exact same stories for people who were on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I Do think we should you know highlight those people's stories and you know get more exposure to those\nStories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and [noise] or we will prior we will um disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by just letting anyone come in\nYou know you cannot allows them to do this\nThey're not going to be allowed to create a mob the border and rush the border\nAnd got a violent and let me tell you something because if we had the wall up it would be\nMore safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened\nAnd I have no doubt that many of the people not care of and they want a better life they're good people their government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid from from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we want it to get to but the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed\nTo take in people from other countries you got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it\nAnd and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they wouldn't be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are going to get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt nobody wants to innocent people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd\nWe can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America\nMaybe it's just the tiniest the percentage wonder if it's five people at a fourteen thousand we cannot risk that\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Russia or border bone rushed the border and get in and we were ... reward that behavior will the next one's going to be fifty thousand that's going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call ... the when they think they have enough future generations of boats\nAnd we can't have it and it's got to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job\nListen I Want to remind you off year elections are really about one thing and that's you turning out showing up this election is one of the most important we've seen in
