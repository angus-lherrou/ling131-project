president going there's going to help ah hopefully brought in Indiana a will be watching and waiting the whole time they don't look to let me tell you what the worst news is in the you know we've been watching all of this happened\nYou know all of this incivility that we've been monitoring and the silence has been deafening it's just been especially deafening from Democrats and the news media\nThey've been unwilling to criticize things they obviously should criticize and it's been going on two years this this is not a new phenomenon it takes on different forms it all started with Madonna I Wanna I Dream an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nAnd deteriorated from there and deniro wanting a punch the president and the face and Joe Biden wanting to punch the president taking mind yard and then fight it out and Duke it out\nYou know this is the Democratic party Hillary can't be civil Eric Holder kick them\nWe watched what's happened to Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders entered kids Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell and his wife multiple times boulders now being thrown through the office window of Kevin McCarthy the house majority leader\nI mean and there's been virtual silence\nAnd we have this terrible incident that we have been watching where you know these suspected mail bombs\nYou know thank God of the ten that have been sent a they haven't even confirmed fully that they're real bombs I assume that they are thank God none of them went off\nBeing sent to several prominent Democrats around the country we do have one instance where Republican is being threatened we ended up the the two instances in Minnesota with two Republican candidates were punched one guy got cold coffee from the ... behind that a concussion that's going to keep him out of commission for six weeks\nYou know we're living in times where the hypocrisy reeks the media Democrats they only care about Russia collusion if Russia collusion involves Donald Trump which it does not\nBut then when they see all the evidence emerging that Hillary bought and paid for\nRussian lies by funneling money too from a law firm to weigh up research group that then hires a foreign national that makes that won't even stand by you know his ridiculous stories of hookers\nUrinating beds in Moscow and Donald Trump years ago in under rosy says I Can't confirm any of this is just you know well it's fifty fifty um it's raw intelligence what do I know\nAnd then that still becomes the basis to commit fraud on Pfizer court\nAnd then it's still becomes the basis of you know these rogue upper echelon not\nRank and file big difference you know the structure of the pages the ... the ... of the world et cetera you know all writing Hillary's exoneration she should have been put in jail or tried but then she gets to continue then she spends the money on the Russian does the a\nAnd then when they can't be Trump even by disseminating those lies to you we the people well then they go the next step their insurance policy which is even though Lisa Page said there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nIs no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton rushing dot CA and that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller and then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief\nIt just as pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new Kavanaugh standard which is guilt by accusation all that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard Camilla Harris Spartacus or Dickey Durban or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation and FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we have real evidence real text messages a real tape real doctors' reports none of them have said we need an FBI investigation into him\nThank goodness the people of Minnesota paying attention because that matters you know again it's it's it's there's just hypocrites they only care about Republican Russia collusion that doesn't exist not Hillary collusion they only care about stopping cabin all but not stopping you\nKnow Allison are not stopping the recent allegations based on the cabinet standard we'd be calling for FBI investigations into Corey Spartacus Booker or Bill Clinton himself up we're going to go back forty years\nAnd the rape allegation with Juanita Broderick it others and then we take it a step further you know they only care they don't care about violence the threatening violence against the president you know listen to this montage of everything that you know just a small one I

current credible threats twenty individuals' organizations or locations here in New York City\nNew Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million residents and the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route a place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable but get flagged out a cop call nine one one or coal or toll free kind of terrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that's where anything new or showing as information about any of the instruments this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person\nYou can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind of nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals who the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nLyrics cities intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second and on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution hotel you that when we look at the offensive yesterday and today I have a match pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD through reaching everyday especially when it involves partnering with the organization's representative here today\nAre concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves safe that's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe\nAnd through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works and and visit New York city who make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor of her\nAnything of any substance comes out the only thing they have said as the bombs had a powder meaning some type of explosive powder and broken glass\nOr which would mean the maximum amount of damage and shrapnel that ... that should they have gone off none of them have gone off usually in a mail bomb like that you would think if somebody opens it that's when they're going to realize that that's the moment usually would detonate a thank God none of that has happened thank God\nI'm all packages or were listed apparently Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the return address thankfully none exploded no one was injured\nAnd this full scale federal local investigation is to hunt down wherever those maniac is that would be responsible for such things you know it is um I don't care who it is\nYou know there is no place in this society for this type of violence these types of threats this intimidation it should have no place in politics or country you know this is evil ... we're talking about and I wanted act of terrorism here\nIt's ah I'd having lived through some of this myself I Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers to go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever support this horrible act or this type of violence depravity as a president condemn the yesterday um\nNobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do\nWhen they can politicized something you\nKnow is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump then they go to Fox News then talk radio and it goes on from there\nMeanwhile we've heard the plate some of it in the last hour play some of it later in the program today the most incendiary over the top out of control statements that have now been going on for weeks and weeks\n... that's that's maybe a little inappropriate for president I think\nYou know it's an end to watch the calls for civilian it just brings hello to me and I'm not blaming these people they you know they can do what they want this what the Democrats do every two and four years we have some interesting developments in the state of New Jersey\nWe might have a race\nAnd then this is only up by three points people in New Jersey of figured out who Menendez is just like in Minnesota people figured out who Keith Ellison is he down seven\nIt looks like you know we're now finding out of the people have figured out who reticent is down in Tennessee and who McCaskill is in Missouri and who's Christine seminar cinema isn't a you know for sure I don't have a problem of Americans joined the Taliban\nI why would she get one vote in Arizona after being that crazy\nBut we have a race there in the ... race now\nWith the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick ... up by two over Joe Manchin a lot of people weren't expecting that when you think about it is logical\nAll the success of the west Virginia ... saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies and mentioned didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital vote was just an election year conversion they'll go right back to supporting Chuck Schumer\nIn Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo of a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to we asked you now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying oh I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nYou know you've got another Daily Caller report\nTalks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason to seemingly to apologize but the Trump assassination fantasy that they published the day before the pipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes publishing ... short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures\nNew York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care of it was only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican only care about sexual misconduct or solve if it's a Republican they ignore Ellison Spartacus Clinton\nThey only care about incendiary language when they think it comes from a conservative not their own\nBy the way Charles Grassley is issued a criminal referrals for\n... sweating neck member she was the woman that made the accusation oh that almost on a weekend basis they would they would spike the punch bowl and boys would line up in the halls and\nThey would then take their turns gang raping young teenage girls anyway\nGrassley announced he's referring Julie sweat neck and I've been out into the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation into the potential they made false statements to Congress about time somebody follows up Chelsea Clinton saying she might run for office if someone retires\nShe probably went in New York\nAnd then we've got I think one of the scariest ... votes in power and elections going on this one in Florida it's getting a little scary I'm not sure if people are fully understanding just how radical\nThis ah Andrew Gillum is that scandal is widening according to the where lobbyist paid for luxury getaways throw him yet that just look at his policies that's what's dangerous to the state of Florida\nIs policies will destroy the economy of lord I'll get into that we get back right eight hundred

Bernie ...\n... you know I listen to Hillary yesterday\nCompared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor of New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they said no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president than making these choices are as you know showing last night I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling\nWhatever the case may be a and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president's I just think it's bizarre I'd say ... way over the top I think\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the SAT we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name um but then he got on and\nHe went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involving the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chased me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me\nBut you know what an opposite now for ready listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh\nThis is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing\nUh the the ... that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka none gee nobody ever it's not being conservatives that have been you know same things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House\nUm it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing separate heads of the president and those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in\nYou know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here I've been saying for weeks now going back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress somebody's going to get hurt somebody's gonna get killed and lo and behold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted\nUp and then those people that were silent when it's a Republican now or oh this is outrageous we can't have those kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they are fake news\nNo they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a capital moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the left who it is CNN anybody\nTell me which Republican which member abide by the media all the political leadership made political profit\nFrom a Bernie saw this

message\nAll right hey go twenty five now till the top of the hour only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I fall into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I've been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good vote with the right thing to do um but with that had um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you\nI spent a lot of the last six years\nSuing the Obama administration uh Shaun\nWe were the office that took the lead nationally\nTo go against the Obama power plant\nOne that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court and you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton\nEven after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have helped serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policy that West Virginians really appreciate\nThat so that's one of the president's comment very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when the towers so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices procedural votes\nAre coming up news round up information

whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks you have a ... a more Republican senators which
