here in America will happen we can afford to risk\nAmerican lives with Hillary Clinton um and she was one of the people that was targeted by by all of this but other postings you know um if you look at\nA that they don't seem to express admiration for Trump's politics so you've got the other side of this you know crediting Trump on the one hand which strategies with helping him open up a sports bar you know why he would put that up there in any way that seems a little odd and weird and uh\nBut I think what we're dealing with somebody with a great instability is one is from MSNBC is Andrea Mitchell a promise to repay your door apply to your threats you know we will answer and coming to see you soon and uh with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank God\nAnd um we uh we have to just credit law enforcement for the good work that they do and it's amazing the DNA trail led to this Florida Man\nHe had his fingerprints on some of these bombs that basically there were small PVC bombs and from what we can determine they all had powder in them some type of electric some type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say\n\nIn that effort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country [noise] we can come from [noise]\nThirteen I eat these four sensitive areas individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nBased small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock were friction [noise]\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise]\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the guy left [noise] based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprint from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters [noise]\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is at ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from ... in connection with an earlier rushed down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nOn during incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and all we would but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud\nOf our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe helping us to find the individual responsible late last night we also\nTurns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nTo try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in

leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work along everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nAbout protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from Iraq\nTo re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed they confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about\nAll of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy\nBroke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd as it did it came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me well yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um\nThere's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to the near wrote to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nWhich I had and he said had a direct language ... may have we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echo an amplified by Fox News and other folks and the conservative jets yeah but you know it's not like the others right\nWhy Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... Robert Deniro I was calling the president devil and us devil worshippers in effect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the tissue to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ... so you may sort of leading\nA lame ing me because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a\nPig is a con artist mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise]\nI'm On a [noise] what are we talking about [noise] idiot as the

it\nThis is a double standard in the media you get conservatives who say you can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible because one of his ... supporters went out there and shot somebody\nBut it's there there is an obsession to always blame conservatives for the actions of some of these ... cases and that appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders and he shot up Republicans on a ball field and Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nIn a way it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nThey've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence doesn't relate the

from\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent of the story of today Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were Barbara concepts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks for nurses are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean congresswoman concept so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he becomes speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change\nI think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes illegal this stuff and\nIt'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys in for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election or you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing\nThey are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same\nRange I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump that is at risk the Republicans in the house and Senate was much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nBarred ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some they have the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh uh Democrats their National Committee two to one\nThe ... that money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week\nAnd you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea ...\nIt's got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh they really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know as those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be basically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically a there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall a maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats when the house what we are looking at almost great certain date is ... come gridlock for two years\nI make a slightly different when I look I'm a patriot first before but I Know John is certainly you're shot I just hope we stopped demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters say\nPrompts responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending but the ten or twelve arms around or vice versa playing the Democrats can we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nThe hope there's no impact it it's it's it's I think just terrific and I just hope we can pull together as a country and not try to demonize them whether it's a it's something which is of assault on our democracy and on and on our marriage\nWell Diana CNN guy today John McLaughlin John ... I\nActually go out there and say um that deniro is not like the others why Robert Deniro one of the things that I found was on October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting De Niro but things he said on Alec Baldwin show of all places and\nSaid that a Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil let's play a little bit of Robert De Niro and the things that he said why been critical\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a big he's a con\nArtist mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has I'd like to punch him in the face\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about the John\nI Know and but you don't want to let some people are hoping that\nAfter this election it all goes away it's not going to go away if what this is about is Donald Trump is a historic president and the reason he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment you there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so what's going to happen is the presidential race is going to start right after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nIt's all about feeding Donald Trump so this race November sex is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump put the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November ...\nThey should go to your website for Hannity dot coms she's a top thirty most important races in the house and go and click through in click through and donate to the Republicans to match whatever the Democrats are doing to try to take control because yes race November ... is really about the next presidential race\nAll right thank you Doug Jones thank you John McLaughlin eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nGuy seeming temperatures will be in the mid thirties for Saturday Rene likely all day with high in the mid forties said you know the rain continues temperatures drop into the lower ...
