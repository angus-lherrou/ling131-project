I think you wait till Thanksgiving and get away with that\nWhat what I used to do and I still lived in ah I Know you're not if you're married and you want to stay married Tucker who would I used to when I Lived in a city in an apartment buildings I Would pretty much moved off of people so I wouldn't have rental more be in the middle for ... everyone else that you know pretty much provide your heating\nFor you that is a nice thing about being on the third fourth floor they do yeah now that the heat from below you had to do it anymore you know now that I have an actual house it doesn't work that's got to be killing you\nI'd love to find a way to siphon heat from my neighbor if I could but I I just don't know how to do with what\nUh what do higher wages I mean if you're running a dominoes franchise you're running McDonald's franchise I'm just thinking I McDonalds you know minimum wage there's what nine ten bucks an hour and you're a line cook there you're a\nCashier there are you thinking to yourself why do I have to stay at McDonald's but I just go over to Amazon Amazon Amazon is higher even Fifteen bucks an hour you have a pulse you can get a\nJob at Amazon yeah in in that a lot of restaurants labor expenses typically make up you know between twenty five and thirty percent of the restaurant is bigger than their rent\nIt is and so if you see wages and again let's look at a company like McDonald's I see a lot of McDonalds jobs being posted for twelve Thirteen an hour ...\n... you say okay if they need to get up to Fifteen right that means to twenty five to thirty percent bump in wages that you're seeing there and what that means is all of a sudden that twenty five to thirty percent of sales that that labor expense used to be\nIs now thirty to thirty five percent right\nSo you got to raise the question is do they raise prices by corresponding you know five or ten percent to match that and and if they do raise those prices do they still keep people coming in if the value isn't quite what it used to\nBe so what do you think do you think you start to see some of these lower end franchises go out of business like if you're running a dominoes do you just say out of the heck with it or ... are thinking about a subway cars subways labor intensive or you walk into one of the stores even a small store I have three or four workers there\nYeah it's I I don't know if you see like the the big names you're you're getting your dominoes of the world you're McDonald's of the world they're not going to go out of business because I think they have pricing power ... the ones that are a little bit more questionable that maybe don't necessarily\nDeliver the same kind of value imagine ... ... what was going to have no problem really upfront customer the McDonalds you\nHaven't labor intensive again they have little to figure out how to do that robotically right that's a robo burrito robo burrito I'd watch that know how many people there would be fascinating when you when you go to a ... ... about how many different people you're working three three\nThree you've got the person put it actually for in some cases you've got the person who first put the tortilla down then you've got the person who in the meat and the other stuff then you usually have a walk and special person then you've got the cash register person\nI mean it it will be curious to see I think what you're going the end result will be most of these will stay in business prices will go up\nBut the workers if you go from ten bucks an hour\nTo Fifteen dollars an hour that's like fifty percent waging dirty bomb and then you're going from twenty grand a year to thirty but they spend here's the difference yeah that that guy that makes goes their wage goes from ten to Fifteen they spend every nickel of that five dollars more per hour that they're making\nIt will be good for the economy in the long run the other thing that dies on the short term and the other thing that does is keep a lot of those workers that are at or near minimum wage are collecting an awful lot of benefits whether it's a food stamps were right housing assistance so by getting higher wages it reduces demands on those programs and actually cleans up things from a budget perspective\nGreat to see happening very great to see happening\nMarkets in record territory I mean in the market has just ripping the Dow is up one hundred and forty one points at twenty six thousand nine Fifteen BS in peace up everything's going the right direction with the exception of oil boils up twenty cents a dollar Seventy five forty three [noise] we'll see you tomorrow right here in the financial\n[laughter]\nSome doors are massive summertime [noise] summer inspiring were grant [noise] others not so much\nAdores the path to a family's dream the face of a small business [noise]\nOpen the doors you back and you'll find a unique place\nSee I see ...

B. I.\nSpecial agent her best friend for a wife\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector tests in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement the ABC I have never had an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I'd Rachel Mitchell if I have time I just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed to potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this or through this with out any any\nChallenging them Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech patterns I look I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice\nCapabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again aren't that many gotten it out there that time we'll see are especially of mine I recognize speech patterns\nI Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\nMerit anybody for about ... about half an hour\nThat's how I found an hour at the tea even me\nI'll talk about an attack bongo crowd in my hand I found out ... to curb pony\nOut her as far as ... even ...

hosting the most listen to radio talk show in the country and there's a big [laughter]\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything's so obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has um that that but\nThey've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we've got Trump out there they claim is mocking balding forty wasn't mocking or\n... I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is what I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine baldy board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying through her teeth\nYou can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very\nCredible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge because it just wasn't\nSmart\nSpecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip them for doing it if they want he understands that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step\nAnd it it might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story\nGuess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump\nPolluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nActually a reference for somebody somebody and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\n[noise] a bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience that don't remember the Clinton\nYears in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nYou never know what you got to do when you're grabbing got about ... what you want to come up with you but you're not going to you're going to come up by women like New Hampshire gray the ... not a\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right and they're trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial but it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters of flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways\nOf the offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nWhat we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where I used to bring capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know would you like an on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry someone\nAnd that was a drunk said the protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know not [noise]\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you protest you know there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for less\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of southern like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the year's naive and the media would want to talk I thought that there were really interested I Know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat

didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday\nBy Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible she's

out to be brilliant by the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was um all Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country can accuse her comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford now Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and\nI'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about on anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with\nThat that gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally\nWhy there would have been held a pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything it's\nWhy I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at the moon to the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell\nUs how he'd be able to teach them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this and pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this has to do so they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand\nFifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski in Collins or shorter ringing towering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was the one the horrible everything he said it's true\nIt was not blocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just said boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel and then\nBe joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nCan't even imagine the organized movement the mail\nPersian me too\nWell rush or men women or nor do they actually do\nWell yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun of the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nRejecting

Limbaugh but yeah I mean not work books your ear is the there's the James was dubbed the gym and guarantee quotes from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the\nMoments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written Ben is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this uh ... well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason\nAnd I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate I pick\nIt ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various uh gems\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case can be capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never the raging angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is that there's this they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been a target up attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts\nAnd it was all about do you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they both means or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating a fax frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to\nDo it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed to speak to you again a great to have your back\nYeah it can be out again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know we had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was right when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the\nOutright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist\nBut it's entirely possible at the same time after him that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she made all literally believe that men have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying or raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped girls are the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nA huge [laughter]\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sexual out consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the right hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine yeah the hook if not better right by the way here's this you're also right up it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from your young you're

he appeared to mock Christine for the kids that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in high school\nIt has been since Trump was inaugurated even during the trends\nIt shouldn't it's been a series of steps or efforts to get rid of Donald Trump to overthrow the election results of two thousand sixteen and I think Christine balls the Ford is an\nElement of that whole movement or that\nWhole desire the Democrat Party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the FBI ideal Jay people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist in on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time so the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's\nJust many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after\nThe Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer the Republican opponent the high camp has opened to ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out or that some Republican\nSenators would wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words\nThese three Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnell a McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night well that would\nBe embarrassing for them\n[noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with your wife found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a

changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by

all happened\nMy other part I wanted to share and I had been raped twice and I'm like oh my God\nAnd I listen to this woman\nI I agree with Chuck I'm going where when you remember the family and what bothers me the ... ... feet are vicious and that's what they're doing to rich man's character to me they are raping his character they are being ... but what bothered me\nPart of me thinks there's something that happened during her send people out there is something happened in our\nBack in ... picking and choosing\nWait a minute when can I stop you for a second bear yeah you because you've just said that you have\nI mean shockingly frightening experience with this could you tell me why you think that a lot of people I think something definitely habit or probably made up by ... something ... why do you think something happen but\nI get by but I'm just listening to some people on the one you know given the benefit or something but what she's doing accusing the wrong person and letting the person I actually did it to her get off scot free\nYeah that's see that's the thing here with me\nIf something actually happened to her\nThen whoever did it\nIs got to be laughing all the way to wherever resented exactly\nWell I'm Sorry I have a problem with this line that something happened to her obviously but did not have been kept well I'm not\nSaying that I totally agree with it but I don't think that that's what people you know because how do you conduct that\nPeople say that because they want to be seen acknowledging her as believable or credible southern no they don't I don't remember\nI did not believe her and she they had I Believe her white ... because she does it say where it happened she can't remember the house you can't remember that there that I Am gr things that have um\nWell what about the business that some of these ah experiences are so so so demeaning shocking mile that people some victims don't want to remember and don't I mean they suppress at you having happened having had this happen\nCan you speak to that 'cause I there are a lot of people who who I'm told have horrible things happen to them and they do suppress the memories and ... and sometimes they're they're forced into therapy to bring those memories out because if they don't they're never going to get past it\nBy well with this ah this package I ended up pregnant\nAnd you know I I didn't let it took me to have an abortion that for a lot now I Can't get you get to it but I think they need to hide it happened because it was near my home county\nI was a um major rack and it was a round the end of a September of Nineteen Seventy four now that day the very day I Can't give you that\nYou know a good thing that works great or if you can't remember that they there are there that happened around that that wall he can say yeah this is what what's going on at the high and this is when that happened\n[noise] yeah I [noise] you you try to put yourself in a similar circumstance I've I've never been a cost of that way I've had I've had a upsetting things happen and\nWe all have and I've tried to think independently none of them and they were approaching yours don't misunderstand I'm trying to think\nWhat thirty six years ago of okay where was fired things have happened at once I Know where I was once I'm able to place where I was either within a given month for a week or even a year then my memory starts telling me\nA within a certain ... date range of things happened I'm In my case the more upsetting they word the more vivid the memory or because they were the event was a formative won\nA for either good or bad but I I I Do remember a\nSpecifics [noise]\nNow I couldn't take it to the exact house where one of these events to me happened while having dinner I Know that it was in Sacramento I ... I couldn't tell you where the house was today if my wife depended on uh but I can tell you the guy and his girlfriend and the layout of the kitchen and all I can do that\nBut where it was I couldn't but\nRape victims in sexual abuse victims um it depends on on on the victims some of them have vivid recall of every detail like this and some some uh some don't but her date range or and descriptions of the house in a place for the people there who all deny it\nUh and the timing of all if you put this whole package together\nIt just [noise] [laughter]\nAnd the reason for it to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this a spontaneous happenstance [noise] [noise] I don't think Feinstein just received a letter she didn't know it was coming just don't believe it can't prove it just don't believe it\nI don't believe he's minding your own business one day in a letter from a constituency who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "03"}
