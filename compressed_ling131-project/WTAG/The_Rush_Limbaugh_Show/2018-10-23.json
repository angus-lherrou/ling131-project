there's so much pressure to keep prices high\nYou know like Saudi Arabia wants the prices to be high in the United states wants the prices to behind the temperature and the prices are higher than two biggest producer right up United States and Saudi Arabia right we both want high prices between those two countries we produce twenty twenty five percent so if they could clued\nThose two countries

bowl and some of these oil companies be honest with you\nI think they're pretty good value they have good did ask that that's what I was trying to get out of balance sheets the because investors are staying away from they are and uh I I I think\nYour profits collectively their profit reports fantastic and I know I Believe all the sectors I Believe the biggest increases an earnings have come in the major oil companies so they got to those companies they got rid of literally hundreds of thousands of workers\nAnd billions of dollars of expense when the price went down what did we go down to like twenty something briefly\nYeah and it's it's been steadily up since then these companies are sitting on Ninety billion dollars of excess cash maybe it's a question of you know where they're gonna put that to work but investors for some reason are still skeptical of these companies will continue to exercise the discipline they've had and let's face it Barry at the at the you know hanging over

developed countries is coming down you know you look at you just look at how much solar you see around how much when you're starting to see and we're in the instance of that whole sector so that you look at alternative energy\nOne could say that where I I think the total ... it's not even like two percent\nIt's it's nothing and when you violate value company it's the discounted value today of all of the future cash flows what does the future cash flows like I was going to learn in Thirty years you know they're all of them they're going to get into that I noticed right like Exxon Mobil will take over the wind sector like ...\n... wouldn't you in a convenience store sector or some yeah you're right so I mean but there is that question of of you know\nTheir game right now is not going to

remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stokes beers a head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic car ride and graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up with a TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA head of election this caravan thing you know [laughter]\nI continue to study this and try\nPick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it\nI Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by immediate isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately\nPoor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about is it is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic it is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for it it's all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with seven thousand\nPeople that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming or walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks have been walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be\nBeing driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking from Honduras\nTo the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nYet obviously is a bunch of left us to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it isn't it's not a caravan it's a mob it's bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way to win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think\nOrganically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues and now an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] to exacerbate against or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of uh stories\nToday on the polling leading up to the mint terms because it is all over the place\nAnd it is contradictory as it can be FiveThirtyEight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and they eagerly anticipated Nate Silver who has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning\nControl of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a four team and a half percent chance\nKeeping the house this is almost identical to five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand sixteen where\nHillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan what\nTwelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go\nThe cook Political Report today has shifted it ate house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecast and there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but\nThat's how this stuff gets reported the non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive\nFund raising hall in the third quarter of this year\n[noise] so those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News in the wall Street Journal blue wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in\nKey states in this story\nIs even is even prepared in a written as another sign that this so called blue way am eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all [noise] NBC News\nHas looked in early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states\nAnd found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in seven of those including North Carolina GOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada have Democrat\nAffiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in the early voting the latest data from NBC\nSuggest robust in a fool's Yaz among early eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave Republicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to\nBegin in person voting is complete\nNow that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are growing up in the early Italy and because of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bat\nOn election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here

first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to

remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up to him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where his greatest coming to strike for rock Obama\nCouldn't create these economic circumstances if his life depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible\nBut beyond that he didn't want this

they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the meat\nYeah they've been lied to for so long\nAbout things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on able to accept that Jim Jim Jim Acosta\nHaving the president whip people up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job is covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the to those make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president got in states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist\nManno man where has this guy begin to see Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally in having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a ...\nJim you can get but you got all kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well Mr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all going to get a laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that's the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary's server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor to these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising gr violence ... but they just I I've never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to

you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past I'm kind of helped out in that regard\nBy campaigning to promise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are elected

falling\nHate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer as afternoon show at some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this to me now it's just\nGone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pass it anymore\nBut what is troubling as the ... behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believe [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling to look behind the Trump and see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're ... and ... knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working his son got like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to want peace that I have ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk

it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftists I Know right to alert in her at all\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they

love people see both sides if things and they he reaching out with the heart they hate certainty\nEspecially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left
