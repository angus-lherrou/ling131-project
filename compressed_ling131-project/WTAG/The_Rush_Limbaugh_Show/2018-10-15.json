[noise] that's good to know the top\nOne percent of earners paid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven point three percent truck than the bottom Ninety percent combined at thirty point five\nYeah and ... and in particular then if you stretch that out the top three percent a of individual file ers\nPaid more than the entire Ninety seven percent combined while they paid you know fifty percent more effectively it's if it's rather crazy when you look at it here\nI'm just how much the top one percent and top point one and so on pay the big reason why is just because there's such a great wealth disparity in income disparity between them has a ... out there is half the population pays no income tax rate yes exactly\nUm and this isn't changing anytime soon\nNo probably not well what about if wages go up right there if if all of a sudden the guy making forty grand a year as making sixty Seventy these start paying some taxes\nSo the the key thing those are those wages for the average person going to go up faster than they do for people at the top and and if the if wages go up\nI think you might actually see it I I for the first time in in probably thirty thirty five years I think you are going to see higher wage increases for service providers people that actually do things\nSupposed to for paper pushers 'cause the the big the investment bankers and the financial sector has been making a fortune for Thirty years I think that's about to change I think it is our life\nIs I think the the need to get things done right people when you look at your high school graduating class how many of them went in to become electricians plumbers carpenters not a ton probably Meg Whitman how about you\nTalked to John overload I'll tell you what so my my second cousin who lives out in Michigan ... she's seven sixteen or Seventeen years old now she can become a welder no couldn't be like I heard it a couple of weeks ago and I was I'm like oh that's awesome but they know my\nMy point is we we have ... ... is a large gap\nWhere people didn't go into trades and physical work I think now we've reached the tipping point where those physical workers whether you're UPS driver whether you're a welder a carpenter electrician or a plumber you're going to say hey if you want me to show up I'm not showing up for twenty thirty forty bucks an hour it's gonna be sixty is going to be a be it's going to be a hundred bucks an hour\nI agree on that but I also think that the people at the top and they're not going to see themselves making less all of a sudden\nOn the road to basis I think their rate of increase will slow compared to the bottom the bottom fifty percent I think it would be the masses just because of demographics and demand I think it's going to change\nThe whole generation you guys you you're like when you went to high school was there did you take shop class did you learn how to wire or do a lecture go we're not work on a car or a pottery those classes there was a car class available and there was like would shop and stuff but I didn't\nI didn't watch up two years actually you know if I wasn't very good at it but I did it will never be a carpenter my point\nIs when you need to hire a carpenter your and pay for it\nI agree I just I I don't see anything that changes that slows down you know overall growth for the top end in the long like I I just I I don't see it like what what changes there\nI think the change isn't so much on the top and\nSlowing as it is the bottom end right rising which has the same that affect it does so if topping ... let's say top and wage growth the top one percent it's been growing at five percent then that means\nThe the the workers that I'm referring to skilled trades people I think you're going to see them growing at ten percent or more rapid rate do because there aren't enough of them they just you try hiring some tried getting electricity to come up to your house so it's tough though if it's if you can find\nIf it's two hundred and fifty bucks for basic service called where they're in and out in twenty minutes yeah you're you're you're just the way it is yeah it's the\nI I agree on all that I just I in this world today I don't see things changing that quickly on the top and the one that's that's the thing is I I still see the top and have the rising squarely now do\nThe Dow is down

America's transformational on everybody but thankfully they still have to win elections and I still maintain that I don't know when that somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections as the lone remaining obstacle\nTo them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't dumped me I Know these people but only a Democrat folks\nWould think that report from a scientist\nSaying that she might be one one

I think one of the most effective ways of getting people to think about this\nHow many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nIt's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kind of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho wouldn't be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the election is uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have it everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data\nAnd since the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awaken realize what a mistake they made voting for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump hatred of hatred of everybody that isn't them\n\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant\nDeserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the\nTactics they have engaged in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly hostility that he has created\nBetween the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but we don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot he always has some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily went in with than just stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like NATO ...\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's it's confrontational\nAnd of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want to so we shouldn't be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich\nSay what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on them you don't need you says he's going to do something he's going to do it or\nAnd what about the economy in general Monday always kicks off a new round of economic data that can move the markets in one direction or the other\nWell we're seeing continued positive news on the economic front or from areas like manufacturing and a low unemployment we've seen positive numbers in consumer sentiment and retail sales but both missed expectations so we're focused their\nThanks Michael this is the ... stock market report with Michael O'Keefe truth and desperate officer for steeple Nicholas in company incorporated member S.

focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comments on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is uh just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nGeneral Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you try one more time\nOkay I Know unless you have to try it again [laughter] I Know and my ... the answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nOil general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her\nWhy she is undermining NATO Trump already called her out on it for doing this\nThe Trump supposedly in the pockets of the\nOf the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less they still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do where he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything you've ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf it I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell him about my opinions with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'd be really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I I think\nThat's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised this honest\nThat's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew before he ran for office and I think\nLot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he suffered

grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop you are going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah and so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this world is is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans not meant for conservatives is not only in about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome that's on a good host I remember that no one will thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out it comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how the press and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay nitrogen intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out on the next is basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist taboo this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops up some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify hurt cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore sees impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm white\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American it's\nClay just minutes sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black\nUh well I\nI understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right I just want his best because a sub Saharan\nThis is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to some continent been some people really get confused you're coming from from India or\nOver to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert or which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well\nNow I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding they'll do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow\nA away and so there are some peachy chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything
