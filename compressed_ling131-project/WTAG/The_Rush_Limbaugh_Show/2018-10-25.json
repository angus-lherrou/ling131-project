I refer to her affectionately as Natasha on a top and\nWashington Free beacon senior writer to Liz Harrington they're talking about the subject\nOf the package bombs these these a mail order\nThe vices that I'm not exploded yet and bill hammer starts off I go into Kaylee magnetic Kaylee what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who didn't leadership have condemned the attack he called for unity then you had a response from the liberal media to then ... the president and they should instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president's\nLeadership yesterday called for the country and come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time to stand behind the president shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article tend to pick the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from me because I can deliver and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun doesn't go off and so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian\nAssassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump threatened for what they've got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us while publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying under Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs to change and Donald\nTrump didn't meanwhile they can call him and not sitting call him a Hitler or they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself has that taken last night at his rally that he was\nPoking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning we'll trade it that it was CNN his fault which basically is I can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing shorts cart has been completely\n... saying that CNN and was responsible for that because the fake news that they're spreading because no one fall into range maniac that offending does\nI Hope it will let me just add a van and that's what they want to be on the record on a mat and then a python showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than any of that an anchor on that network endorsed the play and Central Park to pick the me assassination and the president\nSaying that the only right now you heard Natasha on a top\nThere say you really you you want to be on the record\nSaying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about never see is\nLike blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues you're now you're hearing a senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than a thousand things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone who got inside what about the\nLast what about the language in\nAtlanta and I very fast content is a ... kind of hair and why and what I mean ...\nHad a choice yesterday he saw the president come out saying abhorrent what America to stand for what he and if I Want to see and then she can blame this on the president can blame it on ... John Brennan echoing that how\nTo move forward forward and I find it helped the low road President Trump at the high rise whatever Clinton said last week we cannot have civility\nRight we cannot have civility so what you're heavier yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump and of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter they interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule is here or the technique here is moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go live Phil Donahue your students all the time bill Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it made for me and if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\n\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have a right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought\nTo stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt\nAnd he says I'm you know ... they're marching north it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nBut it isn't\nYou know you can deal with what ifs and couldn't be ... and all of that but but it isn't unless you're trying to accomplish something else so here's here's governor cases now continuing his\n\n\n\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nGood afternoon

on the outside of ... all the time you get your Santa Claus mail\n'em all I'm saying is that I wouldn't be able to spot that those packages contain bombs or explosive devices and every time this stuff happens I always wonder\nHow those things are identified before they're open isn't that what we've been told here these things responded for what they are before they were open in some cases here\nIs

engineering mind\nAnd when everybody finally got to look at what he had done it was just a timer and it's like the kind of time or that would be attached to some kind of a\n... my memory was explosive device not his project was not a bomb or an explosive device but it turned out to be not nearly as technologically advanced as its height\nRight Obama I knew the Obama invited clock boy to the White House\nAnd made a big deal a out of his achievements and uh and so forth so the patient will will for the obvious question is if that guy could have perpetrated if a fourteen year old kid could have perpetrated a scam and his parents were in on it too\nHe got invitations to go to MIT and ah and other schools and really the the device he put together was was not my memory is it was not advanced of\nAll it was a it was almost the exact opposite it was almost so basic\nThat everybody was scratching their heads and wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate ... as I say I'll
