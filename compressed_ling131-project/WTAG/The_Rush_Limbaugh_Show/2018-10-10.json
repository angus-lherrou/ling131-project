where where does that stack up as far as a a cost comparisons to the big apple and Samsung phones\nSo that's one of the interesting aspects of this Sunday they've decided to bucked the trend of the thousand dollar smartphones pixels three Ellie starts at eight hundred dollars and I believe the the the pickled reacts though is that a hundred more so\nNow ... still pretty expected of you if you really break it down at a hundred and fifty dollars more than last year starting price on the ... to a more expensive but at least it's not in the thousand dollar ring that that that song and Apple's afraid\n[noise] what about these uh these home assistant devices I Know obviously we've got a you know apple has one Amazon has one Google's got there's Facebook I think is just launching won the Google Home health as well as the Google is just any anything new coming out of those products this year\nYeah so the Google Home was one of the the three new product together was a a a a pick a tablet or but it was probably one more interesting Prague watches it it's like the Amazon Echo show and as you mentioned the Facebook Portal a device that was just now a couple of days ago\nUh this whole hog it interesting that it doesn't have a camera and it's it's more they almost position as a\nBuffer bedside clock or or or elect or a digital photo frame and so it uh it\nYeah it is part of their strategy to kind of get their Google does that end of the home and and really try to be the ... the one place or the one place for you to control your smile\nIs interesting that they don't have a camera on it are they worried about security concerns and privacy concerns I mean they just recently announced a shutdown of Google Plus and they've got to have some concerns around privacy and data around that\nYeah the security is definitely part of the under current yesterday that they didn't out All right ... at all but there were a couple points where they talked about security\nAnd they're you know the push to protect our\nData but yeah I think that what with Google picking out her birth but in the camera from the home of I think\nThey were like practically a you know shutting\nDown any concerns about privacy concerns about you know the the by buying\nRoger these devices have been around for you know a few years now the people find they have to replace them at any point or is it pretty much once you get one you have one I'm just wondering how many of these there'll be able to continue to sell going forward\nThat's a great question I think one at least I've down once you you buy one of these things if it sets an age as poorly as our phone thing to do now with every year to a once you've got speaker you're pretty much that and\nReally if you buy one you end up buying on to the kind of power or the or or how they avoid it's just it's everywhere around your home and that's why it's so important that these companies\nAre pushing to get you to buy their particular speaker because once you buy an echo or you buy a a Google Home\nOr you pretty much that you're you're kind of stuck to that that ecosystem I that's what they want you to do you're if you're committed echo

that I Want to stay and I'm going to protect my home I'm an eye hanging here at my home Stan I'm going to stay here with my pets I Am not leaving you can't kick me out so this there will be some people who will hang on and state now this area is popularly known even among the locals as the redneck Riviera\nIn modern political parlance it means a bunch of poor white privilege people live there and the drive buys ours are surprisingly interested in this I say surprisingly because there's not a syndrome major population center\nThat can be totally wiped out that they could equate with see see how dangerous global warming is\nBut there is a midterm election coming up and there is going to be a federal response to this\nAnd as far as the media is concerned as an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you right now is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the drive by media are looking at this\nThey're looking at this as a potential political event that they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away\nThere is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum running against Ron dissent this and then Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny it folks\nAnd you can't you cannot ignore\nThe way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios\nTo report on this um it's it's got the global warming component that's number one\nAs a category four hundred and fifty miles an hour lots of destruction a human a destruction as well it's it's got all the ingredients there it is the Republican voting stronghold of the state\nIn in the uh in the views of many [noise] no no\nIf you look you can get mad at me hold you I'm just telling you I Know the media you may get insensitive me\nTo be speaking this way I'm not I'm telling you how day image drive by maybe our planet and they'll react at some point little Brian skills or go out there I Can't vote me that these kinds of things were being showed about oh should at least some of the danger of ... I'm just telling it won't be long to find out\nIt's a hurricane kind of came out of nowhere it was a little tropical storm down off the primary tobacco growing area of western Cuban known as the ...\nThat it sprang alive as a category one and the national Hurricane Center you know this thing is it's looking very bad nobody was paying much attention to it and then all of a sudden it's a cat three and is making a beam line\nFor Panama City in Panama City beach\nAnd here we are um the media is now focused\nOn this do you think Mr certainly do you think there is I Know it's going to sound crazy but do you think that Dr ... might\nBe looking for a bit of a respite from all this Kevin all stuff that you don't think so and you don't think the hurricane\nIs providing just dumb and Terry opportunity for\nAll I Know they hope it turns into Trina for Trump I've just I've noticed and capital all they hope it turns it and Rick Scott of course they want it to her turning that Katrina for every Republican involved here\nUm you know what Hillary Clinton went out the other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much admitted everything I haven't been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there and get her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging\nPeople to be young civil and she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win\nThe house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility I mean they're making the case they're proving the point and there isn't\nI don't see in all of this in all of this\nCrazy they're ranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist I haven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it\nI haven't heard one the elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back\nI haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of American not\nAnything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted\nAll of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves and their families\nAnd their descendants and they didn't care about minorities and they didn't care about transgender where did I see some state I've got an a stack I'll have to find some stayed on birth certificates is now going to offer a third option third gender option\nOn the birth certificate\nThey're ... they're crazy they're liberally lots they are at war with science there at war with biology they're at war with physics and they are at war with common sense\n\nHillary Clinton is not helping them with any of this it's okay to be an civil it's okay to call law if the doors of the Supreme Court and try to get in to stop the swearing in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh\nWe've got that we've got some reaction to it coming up as well and all eyes remains fixated once again on hurricane Michael this next forty five minutes to an hour will

likely high temperatures near Seventy and our outlet for friday partly cloudy and cooler high only in the sixties and you can get your weather all day long on W T ha that's how\nSomebody help me out here what a Taylor Swift come out and say the other day about an\nAnti Trump or did you come out [noise]\nPro pro democratic did what oh yeah it was Tennessee she came out against black burn right uh what is the media say the media said record turnout rent current voter registration after Taylor Swift\nHow many people bought that that is such ... there is no way to measure that that's wishful thinking but the reason I bring this up and I don't know\nTaylor Swift from a pilot coal I don't know that you can put a bag of manure in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in ...\nNow the story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low in ratings well how\nCan that be if she is generating massive record voter registration and then the host the television show an all time low record ratings don't listen I don't have one thing or another but Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of a newer I'm saying\nThat's how it significant but I'm the drive\nBy trying to take these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate for you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks\nI'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord Benson\nAnd a a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise] well whether he did or not he's still in writes pieces for the for they hold uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nI'll do the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill dot com had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama warmly most popular respected public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms are the most popular in respect to Democrats with America such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there was a twenty five percent chance or the Democrats and the mid terms with the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nFor both of these already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and then Trump or verse myself\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue way aims it's a moment for bold and maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible Democrats gain only twenty seats falling short of winning control\nThat would leave the Republicans nominate with a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and triumphant\nTrump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise] you people\nOn the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you'd do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love you see hatred\nUC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies use some house the division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieve an unstoppable dominance\nHis party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert writes Butowsky warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to\nMy point is again do not fall for any of this hype that it is\nOver and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispirited or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up the turnout ... up interest and they're really ... and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data\nThere is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling\nData that they have veil renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is\nNot what we're supposed to happen that's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative\nSuburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six days you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here were trumped up when you got to dial it back we got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide I mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump\nWas the most surprised guy intellectually in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all the press the Trump quarters that's what they wanted you to believe\nNow they've started out saying the same thing has no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix them mistake can't wait to vote for the next democratic on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they\nWish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to them in terms of\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion a head of the elections of a ... watt swim [noise]\n... what the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win in a truck comes or not our friends have tried calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nA ... I don't want any part of the Trump Donald Trump this this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this was done\nThis has put China back on its heels like nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you've got to make deals with us if you want to export your gorge into Mexico Canada the United states because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the child comes never thought this was going to happen\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they would be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communist are trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democrat Party and America wins\nThat somebody has to have much to say Russia's probably ... be met for\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one branch of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skill sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are\nBeautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive beaver network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

monster storm hit Florida on the ... the national weather service calls hurricane Michael the worst case scenario the strongest ever for the panhandle Fox's Evan brown live in Miami\nSuburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as as started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh what\nWas done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on on an for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look at\nThe F the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance for the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law\nThey take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's\nAt stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy\nThe ass not by you in fact ...\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christ you out on for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies\nThat happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it but the Republicans\nDidn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is\nThat Hillary Clinton says it's it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they support it that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a\nMystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity\nThis on the hinge Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data\nA ... great to have used or how you doing\nGood well thank you long time listener first time caller thank you so it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing whereas I listen to do to last night I Can't quote it exactly but\nShe said if you disagree or if if the party is destroying the things you believe in a low that you should be a civil would\nThat not apply to the Democratic courteous well Republicans conservatives I'm big on civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise] [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is justice\nThat is what's called for conservatives and Republicans being

emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia's just proves what a ... Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just to ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interesting he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is there's so many smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you all rushed but what you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... and ... [noise] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are\nBasically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward stability or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre set the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards law and order or restoring it\nAnd it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ... with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word and what not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nWas a labor laws and um when\nYou look at what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern\nEra in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nAlready know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be network\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to manage share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nHave five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

you see ads operate lifts living costs mistakes financing for Thirty years for more\nInformation please come and see a commercial services that size zero eight eight six six eight seven lines here and see you see as we have an engine and your success on\n[noise] since ... see the campaign see so I think I think Fox is dialing back on the potential you will time claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time\nThese are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them they want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\n\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that unforgettable picture to me of these kids are slowing at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon right I didn't\nGet banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get him\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact\nOpposite\nAnd I don't mean the people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy people in the Democrat\nSponsored the audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way that found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current\nAbout Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents well [noise]\n[noise] no [noise] no no we didn't [noise]\nAnd I\nThink that don't get about five and can you blame\nWorst body language honest in other words did she get a hundred percent and match join our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\n\nYou don't hand matches do an arsonist you don't give power do an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so I'm used to having it throw in a ride back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized\nAnd they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [laughter]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty to two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh wherever montage fear\nOf people from

headline yesterday at the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy\nThat has become people regret voting for this guy they can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up

meteorologist sent me a note a moment ago Nineteen eighties hurricane named Alan that covered two thirds of the Gulf of Mexico and again the sensitivity here is is\nDue to the fact the media is hyping

exact opposite of what I witnessed left side of the political\nWell I can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage innocent all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent of women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nWas I I don't know is that any feedback from any other top rallies that you get feedback from but\nWhat about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there 'cause you detect that men were husbands or are they ah for\nThe guy that I was sitting next to rod his daughter he took a lot of small nights which brings thought her I was just amazed that the ...

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings as James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found it so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh up pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from all the Ford or be it for Ramirez or\nFrom ... client was her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you [laughter] thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts you mentioned that's a little bit yesterday but with this novel as it is and if Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried when the mom and they left as an act and that\nAnd then fattening or if they begin to help people\nUm it just hadn't have worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything ... on fire but come stickers and I aren't on our cars because we truly are the silent majority we're not out there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Worcester", "day": "10"}
