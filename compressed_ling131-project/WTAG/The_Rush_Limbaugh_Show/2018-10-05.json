that actually are still growing in a in the u._s. do wild I think there's been a lot of talk about a backlash debate here where there's been some sluggish sales of\nSome of the more well known not most recognizable for him like a like adviser and a Coors Light that hasn't really been something that's hurting or corona at all [noise]\nVery good poll we'll let you go will catch up with the next week enjoy the weekend thank you very much you two\nPolar Monica from CNN a scene in business the brand new name by the way\nCheck out the website this morning actually pretty good they got some good stuff on their whole Monica from CNN Business talking about constellation brands are and where they go from here let's talk about where\nIranian oil is potentially going from here uh Europe and this is a story out of the New York times Europe apparently is working to try to figure out a way to actually be these new sanctions that the U.S going to be putting back on Iran in the near future ... what do you make of this Mike\nWhat I make of it is the Europeans are desperate to keep this deal that they fought foreign place um but it's likely not going to work so well\nIt's very very difficult to move money between countries without a bank involved mhm it's incredibly difficult yup you're subject to\nYou know massive a risk by not using a world wide bank and uh if they do use worldwide back then the U.S is going to hit that bank was sanctions\nI think you also have a tough time convincing big companies to go do any business in Iran right now\nLike ... for instance French oil company had a budget plans to do invest in Iran us sanctions flip back and they said yeah you know what I Know this isn't a French law\nBut if we do this we're not going to do any business in the United states and we're going to get crushed and so it makes no sense so I think any large company is going to shy away from doing any business with Iran so long as you say us sanctions are in place\nI think what we're seeing right here is the tip of the iceberg as far as uh the push for a number of countries to move away from the U.S dollar we've seen obviously China Russia and Iran are talking about doing so and I think the fact that Europe is sitting here saying\nThe most important thing to wash is being able to get you know our energy needs filled rather than where that comes from and I think that's the message that they are largely sending here now\nAs you said it remains to be seen whether or not they actually go through with this but the fact that the discussions are taking place signals to me hey look they're willing to at least consider a world where they don't necessarily use the dollar as the primary means of conducting\nInternational glamour that would be very concerning if the Europeans teamed up with say China to allow the Chinese currency to be the one traded in Iran or\nFor you know for the barrels of oil that are moving in and out of that country that would be a ... an important first step it wouldn't be significant to the impact to the dollar but it'd be an important symbolic first up\nThis is something again I've been harping on this for the last year so\nThis is something pay attention to this because what this means when it's all said and done the reason why\nThe U.S was able to finance the deficits are the reason why the U.S has been able to finance its growing deficits over the last thirty to forty years isn't because us citizens went and started buying up more U.S debt yeah it's because internationally Europe\nChina India all those other countries did yeah this makes sense will continue buying this up in in funding your deficits\nAs of the last three years that's effectively stop they're not buying any more on a net basis threat and so if you see a further push away from the dollar what that potentially means\nIs that it becomes incumbent on us to finance our deficit internally which we've never really wanted to do we've never really had a huge appetite for it because quite frankly like it's it's not good to do that like if it crowds out other spending another uh other winning that you would potentially be doing\nSo this is something to watch okay not so much because of what it means in this specific instance\nBut because of what it could potentially signal as a big shift over the next several years years to keep the story in mind uh Mike you've got\nThree young daughters now sure do two of them just north of two years old and we've got senators now calling for a federal investigation of children's apps as to whether or not or these apps are misleading by misleading parents by labeling the apps child friendly your thoughts on this because you know way more about this and\nI ... I mean the basic story here is that there's a bunch of free apps both in the Android Amazon and apple stores that are collecting way too much information on children and while that may be okay for an Eighteen year old\n... nothing should be collecting it you know location data phone numbers or or email addresses\nFour or five and six year olds that that's to me a very clear red line that shouldn't be crossed and uh it sounds like there may be existing laws on the books here that are being broken and it may seem like there needs to be new laws put into place but specifically location data on children is not something that I feel should be shared\nA little creepy right yeah and buy a little creepy I mean incredibly great\nNow that said shame on parents who are allowing that to happen [noise] agreed I can agree with that that do your research on what you're letting your kids do and how you're letting them do it but in this day and age the the companies or at least somewhat responsible for that action\nAs well for the top of the hour no quick look at market down off two hundred and forty seven points continuing yesterday's sell off a as race continues to rise sep in NASDAQ negative territory NASDAQ really going through steep sell off off almost one in a half percent today\nSo all the time that we have for the week joy the weekend we'll be back here on Monday with more financial exchange [laughter]\n\nFour point ... double duty age E N double duty ADHD Worcester and I argue radio station [noise]\nOne of the Supreme Court nominee I mean the Brady Fox News on this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to that\nShe oh you don't want to just remember I was there I remember that Kevin over I remembered that's what they wanted her to do\n\nYou thought it was kind of dubious you bought it might have been a little sketchy ... forge best friend\nIs a retired FBI agent we mentioned this to your earlier this week a former deal Jay officials\nMay have ties to the FBI's attempt to uh run that cool on Trump her name is Monica McLean again and they were together on July thirtieth when Ford was writing a letter to Feinstein neighbor in Delaware at McLean house\n\nAnd leaving Kaiser is an ex wife of Bob ... a former Democrat political operative Fox News commentator and CNN commentator\nThey wanted her they pressured her to revisit her statement the wall Street Journal has the story or has the story today\nThis was witness tampering this was this was asking a witness to lie\nSo as to buttress the story told by Dr ...

yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet\nI I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nOh it's\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes it

come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead Lynn Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls before the witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's like it

letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might have Senator Feinstein and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely one producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector\nUh her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed the light attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have\nClaimed it's a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ my and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or\nCoaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of college in general the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum\nThat you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't have been to the Senate or are they the media\nPeople as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd wash it but let's

that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out\nThe Democrats like this fit to be tied now I think I have something in my relate to it\nI got an email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out in ... and made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day and that they did sell for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way\nSadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nA billion in tax debt for our clients\nLook the

for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her\nOwn home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch a leftist in charge of those issues in her state this is\nShooting herself in the foot all just supposedly be in unison with me too movement [noise] so I mentioned that we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein's looks like she is well the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she got our hands up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the general camp do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the ... of in hand seriousness

story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate\nHe wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh is a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat and doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this is in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but\nThis he expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction\nAnd reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in this state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way we're starting to losing ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is ... co workers seat And Corker by the way he was also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these some pose the actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to\nAnybody we are going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and then we're going to deny because they committed perjury and I'm going to deny it because they threw ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made it plain that he doesn't think\nKevin all should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action when one of the world are we going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nEngaged
