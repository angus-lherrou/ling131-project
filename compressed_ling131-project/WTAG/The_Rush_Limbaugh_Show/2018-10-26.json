I really get concerned that you know a company like a game like for night can come out where you literally don't have to put any money down right there's no cost there's no subscription cost you can buy additional stuff but you don't have to\nI don't have a game like this competes with that well it it it's different different\nAs ... and I mean this this game is like it's so detailed it's it's ridiculous like it's a whole open world it'll literally take you like a day to get across the map among kidding so it's like ... ... it's pretty much like Westworld yeah your travel on horse and everything and you can choose your destiny whether you want to be a hero or a villain are\nPretty much like that but in terms of foreign night\nIt's pretty like linear it just like okay this is the object\nYou know your team as to finish in first and that's it and just rent some repeat okay um is is is almost like a movie this is literally Seventy hours of a story okay like a movie it's Seventy it's uh Seventy our movie if you play the storyline\nBut you know the thing with you know these video game socks itself you know I I'm a big fan of videogame nowadays because you've seen these kids you know whether it be for Nader a game like this\nIs why to rent a age group really is just like this is how you socialize\nI was talking to my neighbor ah they've got a Thirteen year old son and um you know they were asking like ... and what's he doing right now and his sister was like oh he's up in his room watching Youtube videos of people play video games\nYeah I mean watching for I mean videos that's a whole nother a raise industry itself you know that's twitch which is um you know owned by Amazon and YouTube has its own division to [noise] um but yeah I mean it it keeps these the friends socialized pretty much for 'em you know you go on line you socialize with their friends and\nYou know you're not just sitting in front of a ... a screen and just being a blob like yeah there's an aspect to that but you're at least socializing like people like you you're not just being a loner if that makes sense\nI I guess I understand and I was wrong about this you know I I thought that this was just going to be a bit of a bubble and fired back off but merely to grow industry you can now get a college scholarship in gaming ... multimillionaire or twenty something year old that I mean ...\nYou saw a rubber craft you know and Jonathan crafts invest in the Boston Uprising and believe it is which is an e sports league in it's an easy sports team they invested\nYou know half the chunk

Electronic Arts Activision Blizzard and take to get our active year to date or nothing to write home about in terms of returns but if you take a look at the five year charts and these companies they are truly tremendous\nUm we are coming up to the top of the hour looking at markets right now the S. and P. five hundred has been dipping in and out of correction territory I Believe we are still in correction territory with the S. and P. down nearly two percent one point nine five percent right now\nThe Dow was off at one point by five hundred points now off two hundred and Ninety five points one point one eight percent the NASDAQ and making the big move down over two percent at this point as we had some really bad earnings reports from Amazon\nAnd Google not looking too good either we also had a pretty interesting GDP report coming up this morning or the total number on the top line was about in line with expectations less than last quarter but about in line with expectations\nBut some big concerns about business spending and that's going to be very very interesting looking into twenty Nineteen whether businesses continue to invest in their in roe [laughter] that's all the time that we have this week and a financial exchange I\nA great weekend everybody and we will catch you on Monday\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nHi this is Barry Armstrong and I know that many of you who listened to my show are retired or nearing retirement age if you don't have a son\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something censor me here said that he was\nUm I'm from Avon tour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what is this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party uh he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over the of the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more\nPipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our\nCory Booker in New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them of blow 'em up because they might have blown\nUp in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here\nAnd a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this from everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they like trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy identifying the\nThe people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is\nThis is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we have the GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so that Dr buys are reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the at the predicted three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent\nGrowth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wins he had very often this economy still struggling right along with the Dr wiser reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light\nHeadlined Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being center prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the midterms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat's this week\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has you know like this is\nI sadly I Wish it weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news and what is it and if there isn't any\nNews about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along\nI mean it ... the caravan that news stop being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ahead I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic [noise]\nIn the poll running to Santa has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable poll it's a big deal\nSo ... this is the kind of news that is not being why and\nAnd and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team were doing the clothing with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press\nLike the Russians could be behind it because it just ... times have you with this whole thing was bound

I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to eight seats in the house or are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that slice of document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the the I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs on the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're gonna lose they're not going to win the house back Democrats than the deep state they're not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state loses they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy\nFunction this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\nHe's his comment about going past neutral has market participants wondering if in fact the because the economy to slow down or even turn to a recession any other drivers worth noting earlier this year markets have been supportive but what are\nCalled animal spirits and that's really about positive sentiment with increased volatility that impacts animal spirits ... were actively engaged with clients as we work with them through this volatility\nThanks Michael your path through investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor by yours at ... dot com that's S C I F ... dot com steeple Nicholas\nIncumbent he incorporated member ... bc of why I see [noise]\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older naturally begin to change causing a lack of ... or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in private and helps your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in ...\nIn clinical trials ... hadn't sound can improve short term memory problems in healthier brain better life for ... everywhere\nStatement has not been evaluated by the SPA this product can not intended to treat shore or prevent any disease\n[noise]\n\n\nReadings walking back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal\nTo Alexandria, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us high oh my God what a privilege I could imagine I can remember that very much for me to have you here too so what's shaking\n[laughter] [noise] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted to\nAdd and I love that pedigree look at where you come from you'll come for you you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree that's a that's a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\n[laughter] there you go and by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter]\nI'm sure he's listening today oh that's awesome that that is that's what I Can't tell me how sweet that is you know what you bring\nThat up I have to tell you we we we are ...

shell and room to make room for coverage for the bomb story and when the news stops covering something these people think well let's not happening anymore if it if we're not covering it it's it's it's not happening\nAnd so the sense was that the momentum was being lost\nBy Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were\n[noise] [noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I\nKnow what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but\nWhatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare has distracted\nFrom news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans would go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this is another example of Trump pacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowering the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and the way the backup what she was alleging\nSo some people think that he's um during the same thing here uh basically tampering expectations with the bombers suppression\nState but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway\nAnd there's some people think that this is very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome looked at the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked

it probably isn't an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBut they're forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest and also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\n\nThis ... a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago it seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win\nAnd the two thousand ten men terms how\nSick the free\nThe Republicans one sick the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power ... big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit\nOf an upset [noise] there's also\nPolling data here in Florida and let me let me find this it\nIs yes your ego barely two days after Democrats Andrew

forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is gonna in tight Gillum ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated for\nA we have the news that he had he paid an Under Cover\nCuts\nThe money to buy Hamilton tickets
