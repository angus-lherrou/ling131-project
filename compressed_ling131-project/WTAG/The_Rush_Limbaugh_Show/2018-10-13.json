Todd\nTodd I Know that um I Want to talk about one of the troublesome provisions that you have been here a lot of folks will think I'm not going to be able to give my\nPut my assets in a trust because I'm using the income whether it's from their real estate there rental properties or those investment portfolios but we know that's not the case we know that folks are entitled to income\nThat's correct when they put their assets in these trust so one of the troublesome provisions you have in here is the right to define principle as income in a reasonable matter does that mean that they're actually going to be giving up their income\nNo no this is a this is a tricky paragraph that you're absolutely right people would never laypeople would never know what this it's clear as much\nAs attorney speak what are we ... that it's it's a great question so the the point here is that the trust itself says you're entitled to the income period and you get it okay you get the income this isn't a paragraph that in any way takes away your right to the ... not at all\nThis is a paragraph known as the uniform principal on income at ... and what that does is it's it's a it's a uniform act across the country that allows trustees\nAs long as they in accordance with a reasonable accounting standards and state law exercise\nIt's the power to allocate investment income interest and dividends but not so much interest and dividends capital gain okay the capital gain is principal mhm for accounting purposes to allocate some capital gain two income\nOkay and then have the more income paid out to the person right the reason this exists is not a Medicaid reason it exists because if I have income beneficiaries like you're doing these income only trust mom and dad's of the world\nAnd you have remained or beneficiaries kids yes you need to invest as a trustee your investment portfolio in a way that balances between the two ... well the current income beneficiaries want\nAll bonds right don't get all ... yeah and the remainder beneficiaries want capital appreciation sonic yep no no dividends no they want gain mhm\nWell so what you end up doing as you might you might end up purchasing a little bit more in the game side of the equation then you can allocate gained income to keep the income beneficiaries happy okay in a reasonable manner I can tell you folks that has caused problems there saying you know you just allocate it all to all\nThe gained income and pay out\nThe good news is we have cases out their appellate court cases out there that say you can't do that because it's a reasonable accounting standard in state law number one\nSo if your trust happens to have the uniform principle an income act in it\nDon't worry we have an appellate court case and mass that says it doesn't cause it to be included but I Want you to know that it has created problems and you don't have it in your trust and our trust we specifically excluded because I don't think you need it yeah but\nIf it's in there won't kill you you know what folks there's so much to learn about how these trust operate how you should make sure that you have certain language in

Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified ... totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part and thinks some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them ...\nLet me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the middle [laughter]\nWonder where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea of what\nWe don't know you ought to be your shoes are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh for the midterm elections\nIt is a interesting question though well any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democratic side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to notice on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\n... ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and this Kavanaugh situation comes up and\nI don't you were Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this their range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nAnd put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it wouldn't worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of their range loaded tests like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so I'm too if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging\nIt it is genuine child like I don't even tried like we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less\nThan what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current make up which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but\nFor those that don't get it in amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the ah the party\nHave large here's Jake Christian Adams writing PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but there's any doubt that the

willing screaming\nIn an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage was hate it was poison in the noise\nLabor the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and they were the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is\nAnd the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\n\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to uh not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics Andy insane face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get more rapid\nI

big argue do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what\nI Know what what what what well yeah I'd like\nTo get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of their nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the in the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having a dial myself back um I I'm One of these\nPeople you probably are too I'm only ... people to think that everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries if everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at American the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActing on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in\nTwo thousand she couldn't she couldn't she could withdraw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton according to draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously\nI guarantee you they were looking at those crowds\nThey were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly that would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it\nJoe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story\nWashington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium\nTour taking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show\nIt'll feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public

just just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column\nOnly nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats unique in for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's for this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have any inside their formation on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that two thirds nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning in the Democratic column\nLet me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true it can you tell me what it is anything\nOne thing a series of things that have American voters\nSo so ticked off at Republicans that they\nCannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide ...\nWith the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump\nThat the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nHas a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf discussed other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started we said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching me I mean you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and and\nUh the show started out\nFocusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage\nAnd the SVU cops are running around trying to prove this guy is a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know no officer you know our\nGovernment money is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we fought ever say oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nAll

resign one of them was a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because

back\nOf a tax folks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around a yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver

station he was in general and the army at the time\nAnd the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon says screech to a halt in
