{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Show was out on the road in a twenty Nineteen GMC Yukon this weekend and how was\nIt [noise] ah well it was it was it's large yeah it's like six thousand pounds driving it\nWhen I first picked up by driving in San Francisco and I'm a Nineteen foot long vehicle is not what you want to be driving in the city\nBut a pretty tricked out and fun\n[noise] you know it's interesting um the last week we talked about the Lincoln Navigator and the Yukon especially in Denali trim its really supposed to be a direct competitor she was a navigator and frankly it just does not backed up\nUm they're not when you compare the two there's not a lot of luxury speakers into the in the Denali\nAnd it really ride and feel more like a rock you know like the\nThe IRS kept is on the is on the tree so it's like a regular truck you know where you've got the um the gear shift it's right there by the steering wheel it's gotten mechanical parking brake I'm In\nThe payment system has not been released in into something that's more luxury at the same thing that you'll find in the ... of the models and even on on regular several a model so on the whole it doesn't have the same luxury touches that I found that I really liked navigator\nHow the price to compare for the Yukon and uh the navigator\nBut then all he does start up a little bit lower it starts at about sixty nine thousand dollars but the one that I have that it's cheaper tricked out you're looking at right around eighty thousand dollars for that price point you can get into a mid tram um Lincoln Navigator\nHoly cow but eighty thousand bucks and you still have three on the pre shifting\nWell it's a it's a ten speed automatic transmission but yeah I mean it it\nYou know the three on the tree idea exactly\nI Know that's what I said to him like this is like driving a truck it really does drive like it's our however it does have a ... GM's magnetic right control\nWhich basically use as like crazy engineering magic to have all these magnetic particles in the stocks that can adjust themselves like a thousand times a second so it's always giving you the best with us and fly to ride a product it's a feature from GM cars that I really really like um it\nThey have it on the um on the court that they have it on the marrow they've got an older cars but it really work well in there I'm In a SUV line up as well because you've got this really really heavy vehicle and it helps to kind of flatten that out for the ride on the part of\nWhat I've been really interested in all the new cars that are out there are the the new technology I Do see any of the almost driverless technology in this new cars and the way in assist the adaptive cruise control sort of thing or is that not really something the gym sees put together yet\nNo no there is there's um adaptive ... control I use it yesterday while I was on a on the highway I'm a bay area traffic you know the crazy crazy\nAbout her that that will follow current front of you you can have three different distances um and it will bring you to a complete stop that to me the lifesaver when it comes to stop and go traffic right yeah that's how ... you think that um I didn't have a chance to use it yesterday but it does have those those options as well\nDoes it parallel park itself I wished because I had the hope ark at my yesterday and they were all these people watching\nAnd I thought this is going to be ridiculous nightmare uh but I did it only mess it up one so I'm I Wish that it did have a tale of practices because like I said the thing is eight feet long I mean it is a giant ... and trying to drive it in the city or if you're used to smaller cars it takes a lot of getting\nSo much a family man he's got three kids could this be a potentially a minivan type option how many how many people can you stuff into the nineteenth\nNine people and that's all good lord I tend to have more kids by nine people\nUh no I Can't have any more kids and also for the gym CU gone so that will be happening but\nEvery appreciate your coming on a given your view of the gym C. U. Conn again that's between Nineteen ... GMC Yukon in the hall from C net Roadshow thank you for coming on\nYeah I think that [noise] yeah I don't know\nThat's a lot of money to show to shell out for a for a new car a I Am just not in that market at this point for eighty thousand bucks I Want you know a BMW land cruiser something red with a couple of years ago I Can't even imagine what a land cruiser must gossip the ... grand at this point\nBy yeah the Suburbans all these cars are just they're selling you know there's a reason that GMC keeps you know getting rid of their small size to Dan's and pushing out more cars like this that they are incredibly profitable\nAnd they're selling like ... people want these giant giant cars I just wonder how high gas prices need to get before people start saying\nYeah not for me when I told her love is a out in the suburbs when you see like the hundred and ten pound mom would the eight thousand pound because he'd be\nThat was my mother my mother had a a Chevy Suburban for like years growing up she would plowing down the highway you can only see like forty eight eight and ... and a steering wheel or five feet tall as it was pretty funny [laughter]\nUm so before we close out more news about Amazon each future we still don't know where this thing's going to be there apparently making some followed visits right in the traveling around the country taking a look\nSniffing around Miami sniffing around Chicago apparently a there's a sixty two acre undeveloped partial on the south loop in Chicago so that would be you know potentially a very interesting centrally located a location Illinois pretty terrible business climate I think I'd be surprised if you're that way I think\nNew York Chicago even Boston probably fail with the Amazon each cue too is because they've already got each one in Seattle which they've had some difficulties with in terms of their political climate I don't know if they're going to take one of those three cities where they're probably going to be faced with similar issues down the road\n[noise] Austin Nashville you know you may want to look at red state America is actually good lambda could be a fantastic to global greed excess everywhere\nYeah that's all the time we have for a\nDay of the financial exchange taking orders markets real quick the doubt down a hundred Seventy seven points S. and P. down Nineteen point and the NASDAQ down over a hundred points or ... down over one percent at this point down absentee about two thirds of one percent\nA tune in tomorrow again for financial exchange this is Mike I'm sure Peter how signing off of that thank you\n[laughter]\nMaxine Waters is out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there and get your Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part\nOf me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think\nThat this Duran psychological upset\nIs tied to them ... let me put it this way\nIf we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of their brains lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters\nTo be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so um to see if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging\nIt then the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly the ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote intimate [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nWell we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh more than ... during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both\nSides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand six team they have been mad in saying crazy percolating compounding\nCome pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election\nDay and the day after a two thousand sixteen and his cabinet situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\n\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her policy wants to see the F. B.\nI. documents released she wants a full fledged\nInvestigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Gerald ... house\nJudiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats\nPromising if the Democrats win the house that they're gonna impeach cabinet they're going to investigate them getting thrown off the\nCourt\nThey're not they're not going to let this side and is Kevin old thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what\nYou and I wouldn't call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even ... like ... but we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this ah anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would\nSit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixty and they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it rather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise]\nBut for those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the ah the party\nAt large here's Jake Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but as any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on the hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited hospitals for the seriously\nMentally ill and the shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery were as are the ... on earth weight as anything I ever heard in ... and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing but a stunning ...\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage\nWas hate it was poison in the noise they were the sounds\nOf a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination and they weren't an embarrassment\nTo themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all this\nKind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact say may think\nThe opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout they believe it's going to frighten republic\nOf all brought in a large crowd ... name festival organizers say central

I don't think it just shows how stupid these people and do you notice the freshman the newly arrived justice\nDoes that the newly arrived justice gets that kind of grants duty you would think that kind of thing wouldn't exist on the Supreme Court but it does\nThe newly arrived justice has to do all that kind of stuff it's a it's part of the initiation and it lasts for a while not until the next justice shows up but it last for a while but Sotomayor is not going to be getting in his\nCoffee and he's not going to be demanding in fact he named his law clerks you know he's the only Supreme Court justice ever with for female law clerks and of course do you think that it's garnering him any credit with a weapon it's exact opposite they're saying well he wants to easy pickings\nOh that is that's how they're reacting to what he wants to easy pickings he's not an idiot we all know capital is abusers women and he wants four of them right there in your mind that's how they're reacting to bad\nAerial dumb ass also criticized Kevin offer invoking his family and the wall Street Journal op ed she wrote it's not automatically a moral achievement there'd be a son a husband that dad it's biology illegal decision in biology again\nPlenty ... I Can't read but she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public on to politics\nIs exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or an exaggeration or to make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain this\n\nNow folks to show you how to arrange this is I have and the stack today I have um two maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today\nAnd over the weekend they are related to Kevin ... button they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means\nFor America and of course for the for the Democrats and much of it is I mean I\nJust saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this is it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left one of them is\nA is John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this piece was about this piece is about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats or Republicans walk all over now\nHow many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of war says but I don't\nKnow how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sights a bunch of ... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\n[noise] she had a piece\nOn Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates I told her six\nSince I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when the stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in the Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear\nI don't know why they come from I I don't know who's responsible for creating the molding but I think it's gender studies I think it's a combination of feminism and gender studies\nThat\nLiterally corrupt young minds in fact there is a there's a there's another link feet piece today\nThat describes a hoax three self described

Trump knows it ended up Tuesday news conference he signaled to white women to hold the line you said the people who have complained to me\nAbout it the most about what's happening are women women are very angry I have men that don't like it but I Am a women that are in the\nSense that what's going on everybody knows women and that's going on because they have husbands that they love and\nSons that

the\nOut right ... the the for the whole entire and you've kind of alluded to this whole already result has been thrown out the window with with the left and we are a nation as as you said a number of times\nWe are a nation of law and to be lawless leafy she'd be willing to do in the city to undermine or get somebody\nFrom consideration to the nation's highest court because of his life for the last

almost\nOh I agree with you totally his point I don't like taking\nOver here 'cause I got twenty seconds and and I'm a communication specialist a stay at your words as possible\nUh David here is worried that despite victory here the left has gotten so deranged that they threaten the very structure of America with that range and with violence\nAnd bullying intent they intend to basically strip away everything democratically\nElected simply because they don't like it using violence and bullying and it's a legitimate concern there's that's why they have to be defeated at the ballot box to

got that has become the Democratic party I firmly believe but I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is not a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp\nOf approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained

lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly it's if it's relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in Atlanta rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that\nWas forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court and any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despises insult\nHates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every they this is the point what\nThey believe in the idea is they have\nMust be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years you've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or gift you could ask\nWho is one of the on display in a left his district in New York is harmless but you'll put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country that country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively\nAnd yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some New York times\nCNN doesn't matter

you're letting everybody down you are subordinate yourself to the patriarchy for the\nBenefits that you get you get a relationship you get an income you'll get a nice house you've got a family and so you\nAre a sellout at I'm not exaggerating this is what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\n\n[noise] go the audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span two on Saturday\nSaturday show called afterwards why does does she was running for attorney general ... is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we've highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez fame and it just it it just asinine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of this CSPAN afterward show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me than if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre me angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think his hand do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nThen in fact is this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabinet and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it is scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind just see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were often don't match the lake guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is in is a woman making the point that Kevin raw\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because he\nHas male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe both the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence\nThey just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine balls before they had a two for that someone that not only educate argued that someone that was wanting to put on a suicide vest for\nOh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot who has\nIt's a ... on the final Republican or\nA ...\nTrue true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for\nTrying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior\nWhich was widely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity that never once told outside\nTheir side to stand down do you think the American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be it ought to be that people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this much ... for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend that time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election ... Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people are gonna be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the that hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around a lot of people\nI saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this is going to be so old bite and actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet [laughter] I just to have the tropical\nUm\nNow I can I can see with the passage of pie you cannot maintain this river passion\nFor long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm ...

that not happen to vote would have been the same fifty forty eight\nFirmly believe that this is not to be critical of Susan Collins white the contrary the turning point was Trump explaining\nTo the nation that loves the Ford could not backup or corroborate her story that has not happened that did not happen in the hearings\n... got away\nWith the incredible as far as the hearings were concerned only when when Trump unloaded and told America during his rally that she can't tell anybody where it happened when it happened what year it happened\nWhere the house was how she got home what she said after it happened to whoever none of it the people that she said were there all four denied at the American people didn't know that the drive by sitting reported Trump was the turning\nPoint chronic

I'm On my list from the earliest days and I'll make a comment about the Democrats the whole process because hearing and then if you have time I'll tell you how you converted my wife from my mom listener to one of your most loyal fans which is a crazy story but\nAnyway with a with a capital hearings which so\nSinister and ironic and all this is if you remember back to Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days of my mouth out early but very a\nFaulty accusations with him on the media Saturday Night live or every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these when they made fun of their books in the other way\nThey market their stories of the fake discredit them they questioned the motives on my doctor for where are you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have\nVictims remember in particular we need a broad Rick the time the place to who what where when with with\nUm and the irony is so disgusting and there's no political motive with with a Bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party and that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect\nWeapon use ah and I hate to call it a weapon but the the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see Schumer I'm a turban and number of them wouldn't even take a call from would need a proper a member of their own party\nYeah let's see they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there because they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe ball the\nBut the fact of the matter is and I will say and again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened the women who accused Bill Clinton they weren't destroyed and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying it was called a bimbo rupture in June and it was Hillary in that seat

doing stories on Kavanaugh that got you know they're going to keep the front and center he's not going to go away in ... defeated him\nThey would have just pick someone equally is right wing his
