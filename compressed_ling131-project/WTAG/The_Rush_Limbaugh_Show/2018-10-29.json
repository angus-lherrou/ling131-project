saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe phone call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly\nI'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by maybe ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nThat Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare\nThere was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up what is that we're\nTrying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they liked her doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to end up their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets ...\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party\nOr it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger\nAnd if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by media is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from a weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have\nYou because they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man to pay attention to it it is my your mental come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about\nHow many people do you think are fed up with this by now you would think this is going to affect the maternal eight Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya\nNeither of these events that you are hyping are gonna ... change significantly in the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going to pretend the rats at least two things up\nTo try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these to stab unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but I ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported you had the support stalls you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemn there weren't any consequences for the protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about\nThe shooter in that in that ... that Mike Brown good order first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... whatever they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now if if it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now it's because of this\nNobody believes what'd you say nobody\nTrusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it so obviously you're you're passionate about\nThis is what you're going to do with this politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is\n[noise] the guy that shot this place up hated Donald Trump\nDonald Trump was too big a Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism before marrying questioner he mourned the American embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming\nTrump is saying well a lot of that that Iraq and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that that that that they just did that the\nCover up Trump's real anti Semitism Donald Trump's maybe one of the best friend is Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember\nThe case of was assistance to David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers\nThey're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch and his wife Julia donated funny the five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's not doing except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow ballet and white privilege racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as ill motivated\nWhy does somebody think that way what wouldn't make those nurses thinks that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media I submit to you that it is near union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they have in school\nWere not even a legitimate acts of charity work compassion are allowed because they're not real their relief from racist in begets who are trying\nTo mask and cover up their racism and bigotry and so the money should not be accepted

works is [noise]\nUh thirty six year old allegation can be made for which there is no evidence and for which for supposedly witnesses candy been placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't aware it happened doesn't uh when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kevin ...\nIs supposed to sit back and just take he's just she those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told to tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him so\nTrump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nThey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to armed with school police and it was voted down eight to one\nWell the thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control is not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than\nThat it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftist [noise] ah yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified I'm only caught and joint base where multiple services around the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked for Trump takes a helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit see sowing guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd on and tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nSilent crime it's why people have

got Obama was up to his eyeballs in hard core anti Semite like Al Sharpton and out of the White House over a hundred times\nA year old Don extent and that hard core anti Semitic church Jeremiah Wright's church\nAnd then that photograph of Obama yeah you know with that world class Jew hater or Louis Farrakhan well\nWhat did they say when you ask them that\nYou know [laughter] I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that they can say damn world that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not that Obama was their guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight ... well spoken a highly educated reasonable academic intellectual um and in look in the leftist world the only African Americans\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama are hanging around ... minds like Farrakhan agenda Reverend Jackson Al Sharpton busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks I feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that ... that that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable we may have excuses you know we can look their way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was Farrakhan standing right next to him all of the Aretha Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him\nAnd many drive by news organizations crop Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but\nIt's ... this is the point we have a two tiered justice system and

double duty AG HD Worcester and I hardly radio station\nIs no place for anti Semitism in America needs to Brady found is that from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein moments ago echoing the president and condemning all hate crime\nI couldn't take it anymore you know it it's not even my religion and\nNot worry that limited by what was that rabbi conditioning what was he was he suggesting that the congregation as Jews\nHad signed on to the Al Gore climate change premise of that was part of not not the Jewish faith but then if you didn't describe George ... maybe you wouldn't be welcome\nI don't think he when he when he was a fostering an atmosphere where he wouldn't be welcomed but I I think you know\nIt's just a pilot as soon as they should have everything right that wouldn't have happened in the entire time I grew\nAt a at the entire time I ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grow up in the military and I got my dad was an air force that there was never politics never came current events dead but not politics\nLet me ask you this was a thing like ... or in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parents' opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to it when it comes to Israel\n\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them oh I Know they wouldn't\nThey were but couldn't couldn't he said that they were I mean because what I say\nThat yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\n... they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [laughter]\nWell there was one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in their religion air time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think he can and it you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal and Israel comes that no way that I did this flame or I'm Jewish but\nI totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that it yeah that comes up and that it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel as a poke 'cause if their entire religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavor [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian Quito um I don't\nSee them as necessarily being seeing Islamic ... I mean you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nThis ... that's exactly right and I assist wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no\nUltimate power that can meet out approval to disapprove of ... than one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so\nYou have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it and to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would Monica she'd have to think about I think that that these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad you because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much\nRachel I prefer this racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an\nEntirely different bits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives

synagogue shooting started\nAsking the president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is Washington disillusion Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be\nPunished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern

be established something that cannot be proven but yet there is reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot\n[noise] [noise] you know\nI don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist and reporter for the wall Street Journal is the the international\nPolitical expert at what have you\nAnd I used to think of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation to the point that a lot of ... ... people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on there just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's\nManners and his behavior and his ah\nCompartment just isn't present control and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets propagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart was says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O the White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue in the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people\nAnd institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder\nWherever it happens they are politicizing the whether\nRepublicans have been called murderers by the Democratic party am willing accomplices in the media Mr boats simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care industry\nFor the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] [noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism successfully or why\nThe mainstream media is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual it certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful in propagating\nExtremism and are you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber\nBy rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I also mentioned in the first\nHour that Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected precisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's kinda understand\nA little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but Trump dead and\nSo they all start laughing at this guy can't be serious he is not gonna last his campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting and this guy\nIs not going to last there's this craziness\nTrump tapped slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary and all of them had this preferable\nA land back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want Trump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they thought this is to sit that can't happen these camps that you've never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody\nCan survive but Trump survived and then they started the two years silent ...\nAnd that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that\nI or anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he is doing\nIn corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election\nI don't care how much power I think I've got I couldn't come close to doing what was done and has been done the past two years\nIncluding the Mueller investigation including the planting of out right lives five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof that Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election\nFor two years Mr boat for two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping they were hoping and they live with\nEvery day with the idea of going to wake up and the the smoking gun was going to fall into their lab but they knew\n\nThat there wasn't any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on\nThe FBI the OJ they knew the tricks being played and they willingly supported those tricks they ignored the real collusion and reading of elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power use think we've got over here on conservative\nMedia we couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent coup using the upper reaches of power at the department of justice all Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists\nWe no way we wouldn't have the power to plant spies in the campaign of a presidential campaign that we opposed there is no way any of us\nCould write up a phony\nDocument purported to be real intelligence claiming that Hillary didn't despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire so warrant\nTo spy on the Hillary can't there's no way any of us in the in the conservative media could come close to doing anything that has become\n\nA natural everyday occurrence on the ... you want to talk about extremism and this this so called magic goal of ... to brainwash\nWhat happened in the past two years in the mainstream media brainwashing the American people do you um\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I Wanna I Wanna I Wanna ask a question here when Robert Mueller does not come up with the goods\nWhen when it is finally admitted\nOr allege that Donald Trump did not ... ... with the Russians and he didn't cheat steal the election how many crazies on the left are going to go bonkers when they hear this meaning how many people in this country to this day at this moment still believe\nThe Trump stole the election he worked with voting on the Russians to do it and it's only a matter of time and why do they think just because the media has a short them that it happened for two years\nWith the constant reporting of anonymous sources weeks here leaks there James ... manufacturing weeks to get a special counsel appointed\nJames Comey refuses to go public and tell everybody Trump was it a target when Trump was Trump has always been the target nobody else Trump remains the target\nAdditional observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yeah now I I normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they set this neither my wife and a rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFarrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because of their fears about what might happen\nOn my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive may never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to then all of a sudden my fear where is it leading to where does it it's absurd what are you where is it had a\nYeah my own thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the lessons you you we we have gun free zones and schools now you can't put ... only people get in with guns or the bad guys who people up [noise]\nUm the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left is the problem so the presence of guns mean [noise]\nNah no
