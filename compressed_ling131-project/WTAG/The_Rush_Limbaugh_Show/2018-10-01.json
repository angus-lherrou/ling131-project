Kennedy agreed to join trade accord with us in may call sending new NAFTA deal to Congress\n\nSo we're renegotiating NAFTA\nCanada Canada which said they want to know part of it they asked in the last moment hey don't forget us can we be why did this to\nPrompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just me and the parents jumpstart hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\nRemember how to drive ... and the Democrats and the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was going to provoke which I ... couldn't possibly being good at it might mean the end of what ever Rangel or making what the North Korea and it might destroy existing good relations with the child comes\nUp up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on a wide range of products China\nBut trying comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the tri calm finance ministry yesterday\nThe track I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partner such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies to have a\nThe elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits for Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one I thought it was necessary to do\nAnd it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at a loss for point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than that throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even\nLonger than I maybe forty five minutes I'm\nIn an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions from the Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain\nHow trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks not very off\nAnd thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process\nAnd in discussing this substance and the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they're talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen all this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump is turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days

rose garden from Dr by me I Would jump it but the things I Want to get to hear\nA and I can just as easily relate what the president and he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying trickster isn't skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party\nWhich uh we do with all the time I hear but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct about me as\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal ... find that at one of them with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came somebody raised the question of how the world did Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week because it was it was we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and that she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington Post\nShe called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people were trying to\nClaim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a nose ring or\nIs it fair it starts button light and it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because the limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine balls before and they would see in the letter and\nSome senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there in ...\nThis was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order the chairman Grassley and and ... a German wrestling I ... I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here in a leak it she turns or did you did you look at she turns back to the camera women will make it\nThis German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say always this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets turned her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your weakness letter and like\nOh no I don't know what was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it and listen to him and\nAs the case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was the teaching strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a

know if the people calling him or not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not\nSomething for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new

oval office was during a\nAn announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates the NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by Israel under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one in three or four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of them are repression polls polls that are on very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome like you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad state Nevada misled I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this whole\nFBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote\nI'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing his best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr ... needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC in Hawaii of course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way\nThis investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why did they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on this they will say to which the response as well they

net\n[laughter] to listen to the station while away from your radio is really not much of a mission\nTo use radio five eighty or Ninety One point I don't\nKnow if you're going to ruin them to go right ahead [noise]\n[noise] ooh\n[noise] yeah yeah the brothers funk brothers of Motown backup banned [noise] bumper rotation of ... by being a mom so I just saw it just took a look at the Drudge Report during the break\nAt what the what is the headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on the like what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly nicotine St fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin on inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys don't do this that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting invest which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty\nFour people they want the FBI to talk to\nThis after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nDelayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen there is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named just somehow insufficient\nAnd somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point that this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped\nUp here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when whatever happened to her happened and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything on like Bob Mueller face stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start ... for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kevin hasn't been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible Kavanaugh is not\n\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it\nEither no such thing but he sure fell for a debate I Am not limited and the thing I it's totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them\nProperly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here are really really screw on the porch and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\nWhat rush rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[noise]
