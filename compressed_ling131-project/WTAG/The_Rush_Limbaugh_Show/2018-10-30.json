News John unit is young Nineteen sixty two to Nineteen eighty one ... he was a news anchor talking\nTo you again it was a journalism major uh he became so influential in the role that when he began to question the U.S war in Vietnam President Lyndon B Johnson said if I've lost Cronkite I've lost\nMiddle America and he was absolutely right and George from Denver's knew that CBS was\nThe correct answer George congratulations are trivia contest brought you buy seasons fifty two with forty three locations nationwide including two in the Boston area and one in West Palm Beach seasons fifty two

percent in the last month and they're down six percent yesterday which was not that bad a day right day yesterday and they were down another six percent\nSo is the boom off the roads at Amazon well the issue here I don't know shares yeah I I don't either this is again as a company that we have a lot of respect for and totally get Myers just the one that neither of us could really figure what ... really worth\nI'm In you know this is a classic example of a great business that's now into several great businesses\nThat just has gone to infinity\nAnd you know we can make the case that a small kept company could be worth infinity because you can make growth assumptions that are appropriate\nBut when you're dealing with a company that's worth you know seven hundred eight hundred billion dollars growing at twenty nine percent revenue right isn't that what they're grown it twenty nine may maybe twenty eight something like that and and training of the multiple in the triple digits\nThat seems like a disconnect so you know Amazon came to the end the problem is is when you buy me like that you're price to perfection and as long as things are absolutely perfect that works out the music stops one day when something imperfect happens unless you're Tesla well they've had their bumps to\nThey had to look at them you know this I eat one must is a magician either kept\nGot nine nine months I mean it Tesla's stock straighten it three hundred and thirty five dollars they don't have growth like that I mean like you look at those two companies and their you know similar in age I very uh you know flamboyant and genius operators right I think you put Bezos and\nMosque in the same category in terms of genius right ah\nBut you know Tesla shares bouncing back I I just don't know ... ... it's still to be\nVery difficult for me to get my arms around\nAnd try to put a value on ... and I'll tell you I I think ironically it's because they're making so much money that we can now treat them as a fairly mature business that can be valued and the most positive analysts I heard say maybe in twenty twenty even get fifty dollars of earnings\nIf you apply a thirty multiple to that it gets you Fifteen hundred those are aggressive optimistic projections on a very large company to begin with\nSo now we realized gee you know this is going to be tough to justify it didn't at fifty even though it's down yeah four percent is still look at it at least I Do a jaded I and I say\nYeah I ... and you know part of the problem is I've always been a value guy right whether I'm buying real estate yup or whether I'm buying stocks and I can't get my arms around this time\nAnd that you know here's the thing being a value investor you and you let a lot of sexy ideas run and you don't get to take advantage of them\nThe good news is when the music stops you start looking at these Israel businesses and an Amazon really has been treated as something that just is never going to go down\nI I Will say this and defense or the price for the first time in many years I can actually say you know what it might actually be pretty close to being what it's worth [laughter] and it's been way in the sky way it's been trip I've looked at that and said it's triple would I pay for it yeah now it's the point where it's like okay if everything goes rubble [laughter]\nIt's it's a justifiable price now I don't know [laughter] not not something I'd jump on whether it's at least it's not as ridiculous\nIt was it was IBM down a couple of bucks how you feel about them\nI Know you own it I and I don't mean to put salt [laughter]\nI mean I just do like Jenny Romney I you know I gave her a chance she's been there six seven years she's seems to be making bad decisions here's where it comes down to for IBM at some point the watching type technology will be a significant part perhaps of the way we handle health care and deal with incredibly complex issues\nAnd the other issues this whole hybrid cloud this this cloud that's necessary for the most essential things that we can't be screwing around with Adel\nThey're going to have a leg up on that you think so because of the ... yeah yeah and and we're in we're IBM's already positioned up so like they're going to try to be the high end if you got to\nIt needs to be addressed every effort that Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere\nAnd yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to say this just being done ... upset Trump's base that the\nImplication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression\nOr illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of Donald Trump\nBut back we'll get to more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night it's going to\nBe a red wave Russia I listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red way but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number\nMany of them are committee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks\nYou know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house into private sector success life had forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known for that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House and the first men terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they caved in\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware\nOf this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of 'em did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is random wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Lynn Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great\nBook grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative here a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained opt in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements\nOf democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red steal\nA movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they

us\nIt's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay a little bit more background\nOn the fourteenth amendment here [noise]\nBecause it's going to be relevant as the if you're goes forward [noise] again it was added after\nThe civil war its purpose was to overrule the\nDred Scott decision which was a horrible Dred Scott sanctions slavery Roger than it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy it held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed that freed\nSlaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states added up a state where they reside which means the draft or is it the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote\nThis meaning the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case ... versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject to tribal jurisdiction not us jurisdiction will lead an illegal alien here\nIs not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from that they're here illegally gas when this all changed\nIn the Nineteen sixties concomitant with Senator Kennedy\nWanting to re oh we had shut down all immigration from Twenty one sixty five along comes Senator Kennedy in a pre Chappaquiddick days wanting to reopen it for the express purpose of making sure the Democratic party\nAlways had a permanent underclass of voters dependent on them and the governor and you're listening\nTo Rush Limbaugh

I I have at times I marveled that this country it's held together the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally rip it up throw it away and establish is on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason and\nMake it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue to issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind uh\nFamily dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kid the hit until you hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\n\nOutcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school were going to slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment\nIt derives from\nI have a right to help self esteem parents have been teaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In\nIt and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses and we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election that is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump presidency\nAnd all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling the newest civility and alleged tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the drive by telling everybody and we need to tone it down they told Trump you need to tone down their rhetoric dude you're causing all these people engage in violence Trump said I thought I had gone to down if you need me to turn it back

citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... ... it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques that essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the those black coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten took him first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not\nBelieve me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been a people being granted\nCitizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in ah in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians is that you know but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture that ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's\nWhat's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this\nThis mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company gotta we gotta do this we got to do that\nAnd if it's being said if that's being said in the media you know it's all and\nThe way low tech manufacturing that's being done now in China that could certainly be done down there I haven't heard anybody talking about that that is what kind of that was kind of surprised that uh but nobody in the Trump Administration has been mentioned that\n'cause I don't think that's what this is about NAFTA was supposed to do that\nAnd it failed royally uh these\nPeople in a caravan are not looking for jobs they're not looking for them it ... maybe a few of them are but this whole thing is\nPolitical this is a political movement these people\nAre being paid somehow somebody's paying for all of this to happen\nUm there are plenty of places to ... the only place they can go to the United states that can stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries [noise]\nAh well I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and if we had a far greater distribution of capitals that would be fine and dandy but the caravan and\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was all about door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... [noise]\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here 'cause that's if people are capable being hired anywhere\nYet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI looked you know either George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their\nPurpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done do it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\n[noise] Ah yes fresh uh two years ago my husband and I adopted for Hispanics sisters\nWho were in foster care and we had had him for a couple of years and then they cannot fuck option their parents go to Betsy Italy Gulf of Mexico\nThey have slipped over the border at least for high illegal a one party at the end of each time they had children here too and then they come back to Mexico left on my grandparents came back had two more went back and got him a long shot is that\nEven today I had you know they were came to us thanking Trump for the horrible and that that's what he would send them all back home and and you know they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and he even said because I saw this in prison for twenty eight year\nOld mother fled Mexico not of course that's a for\nThese people come here come the awful crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just said and they can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border\nSeven months pregnant and they let her across they sent the other six to eight teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have hot they do see a situation they\nNeed help but you know even Hispanic girls that Trump was horrible that he was to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them you know whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support it's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe\nAnd so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't\nAnyway appreciate a jam thanks much will take a break and be back at\nUs and Russia\nI'm Tom Cox owner of blind ... dot com bust or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved into a new home and needed custom blinds we did what many homeowners do and got prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten\nLines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blinds I offer a bitter free guarantee meaning if your bones don't fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd now it made it even easier check out our new tools cellular shades the first and only shades installed without screws or tools what can be easier for us listeners save up to fifty percent off any order just dinner the code Russia checkout\nLines ... dot com that's blinds T.

Michigan Militia shortwave radio network is what the excuse was\nSo now that's become a me we have here is this a montage yep we got a bunch of CNN people and some National Review people\nUh

been radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized\nRadicalized people seeing what the president and his support it and I thought that sank\nWhether it's Sarah Huckabee or Donald Trump the half truth thing leads to people getting radicalized who is radicalizing people in America Donald Trump certainly affairs responsibility\nFor the bomber was radicalized into sort of this Trump super fan community has radicalized so many more people than I Am very proud\nJulia Ioffe off there she is with the art I guess the ... she is GQ and I think she's a bottle of jive yes GQ writer Julia yeah the Trump is radicalized many more people than ISIS she said\nThat while I was a guest on CNN and then she apologizes for claiming Trump was radicalized more people than ISIS\nShe apologized to Monday

was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up ad leftists all over the place now\n\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Reince Priebus might shield\nAnd Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violence at the very serious thing to do that\nShe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists you cannot divorce the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's max boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not a very conservative but he certainly wasn't this\nWe have to ask the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people\nDonald Trump is encouraging this the moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they've been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you know what it is rooted in folks it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight\nWas that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots\nAnd I ... valley\nAnd I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand it and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in they never understood\nThat you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nAll of you had been saying to each other but you know we're not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laughed at\nUm and especially the dog

A. T. dot com [noise]\n\nI'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] the comprehends I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent\nCaller I lost her when she just how families will gas light\nA the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition of gas light\nA I got ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course is abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples would then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file a lawsuit strength to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse\nTo bake a cake or take photos and a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence is the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as no the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude know thing that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for a wedding and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against them so they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out to me\nThat typical Indiana ...\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she thought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting it went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against the Democrats since Obama has been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand\nMaybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana\nIs gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a synagogue shooting well the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you if isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the electoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nAre just as as as she was [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris what I gotta I gotta you know I'm On Fox News
