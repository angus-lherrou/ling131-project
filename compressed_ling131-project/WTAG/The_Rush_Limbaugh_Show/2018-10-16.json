the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it doing clue in South America when other reason\nThere isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe\nThe leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to the terminal any engine they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\n\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump\nThat her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present Hervey kept having to take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about it's not going to melt down and it's Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and fill out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there hasn't been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house in a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world\nUsing common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave the trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections\nLeft and right and it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide\nSeats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses\nA governorships\nA you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election they continue to\nLose even more in the end the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nI'm not a robot should've are never going to sweep may never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue\nTo lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear\nEvery day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what\nIs this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats\nIn ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\n... got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation data he simply is not used to hasn't I mean it\nNobody else liked the turtle in our party yes those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment to Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are

way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr Carlos ... use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she is an ending you got one one thousand twenty fourth\n\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nI mean it's laughable it is the fabric\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every out there saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no not was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult so\nHillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's under cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be barking on what a stadium chore\nOr yes bill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium tour where they're going to go and hopefully drawing crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if Trump can do what they can do it if Trump can do what anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had a number of the the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are

the same thing and it never\nHas happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want you may think rush still enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks\nYou may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nYou have already Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party

[noise]\nThe media in the United states is trying to say to report\nThey're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the ... and murder because Joe ... show he was wearing an apple bought\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan she had his iPhone in the family sit down and she had instructions to\nCall a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bother to look at it\nShe had instructions to call somebody didn't come back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized sort of get married at fiance that's waiting outside of the families that down and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and airy bought something could happen\nAre reporting that his ... was recording everything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does even if if the show he had a new watch the series for which he didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the ... there was no way\nYou know\nIts its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches the phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think of the golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most about what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch\nWas recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\n\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be prepared to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording\nIt doesn't start yeah it can store I think up to a hundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back into close proximity of the phone\nFor his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply it it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than [noise]\nWish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the families to Dan\nWith the with the fiance now uh [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay for the secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign and Rob Mills I this is\nThis is important because this new is just not being reported in Missouri\nWhich is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state now what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project Vera toxic Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nVery task news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ me the Breitbart News\nYou know cure report back there is no way piece here why there is no New York times here there is no St Louis

Google Claire McCaskill and project ferrets us every site running this would\nBe a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is as McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly says that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project maritime us secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the end the project maritime ... secret journalists are talking about the second amendment\nOnly here I mean I think we can actually

to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that\nOr even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\nShe said if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total\nNRA folks the Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on

might have to get rid of the everybody's on board with getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and\nBanning things more on on or you can't say might lose votes\nIn the Boot

[noise] rush what about why fight a good question [noise] the way why fine on the apple watch works\nIs and this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThe the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even an L. P. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by\nBluetooth if the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on the wife network the watch is capable of why five but only if\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that why fight network\nFor example when I'm at home uh I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connect via wife by\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe fire on the watch learns it but I still I have to manually answer the why fi password on my watch\nFor it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... I've got a wife ... state what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that your mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password the phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect you with the watch will not\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate with this phone and if I Want a previous visit he had logged into their wife I work with a password\nThen his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech ... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been logged on what the password does not mean to watch as\nEvery device connecting to a wife I network half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice it may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncles eats house and\nUncles IQ has a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that ... phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest and his little do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice [noise]\nIt's fascinating it's it's uh it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch\nEven if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... network or access it if he done that if his watch worked on why fight in that conflict than he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the car ... wife I Know it it it it it because he didn't pardon me out of range for it but but it would still need the password still need\nA [laughter] well I don't know if they would say no or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this as it was probably will find devotee okay who knows but\nI doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot from whatever cell carry over their\nOffers them but even even if that were the case um look get another example of\nTrying to explain that you go to a city and you get in a\nCar picks you up the airport or whatever and the car service has wife Ryan it it's just a hot spot the driver gives you the password if necessary you log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Worcester", "day": "16"}
