I was intrigued myself ah when when I took a look at it\nAnd what they're actually doing here uh this is part of a promotion called Jet Blue for good month or and so it's going to be a trip that takes place from November twenty seventh of the thirties so not giving away just any free flight after Thanksgiving what is going to be as you have to go and sign up for this promotion here\nAnd pretty much it's going to be a largely community service oriented trip for four days the Jet Blue is going to cover all your costs on\nAnd you are going to go with pretty much a hundred people a fifty passengers as well as a guest of their choice and you're going to go somewhere the location being completely unknown to you you have to get to New York [noise] yep and they are going to fly you to go do community service for\nThree or four days ... it's kind of a cool little promotion that they do or just to you know raise visibility for the airline and it's good that they're doing some good as well because it doesn't cost much and they sure got a lot of publicity out of that they get a ton of out of it so it's a it's overall you know I wouldn't be surprised if you start seeing more of these types of promotions these the kinds of things\nOr to build a lot of goodwill for companies in the day when you know companies need good Wilson you know we're seeing obviously just about every day a guilt companies doing a whole bunch of things wrong but this year pretty good promotion I think that one and\nI was surprised to see that thirty one percent of baby boomers are not saving for their retirement of if you're a baby boomer I mean you're getting pretty close to retirement yeah and they're not saving for retirement because they're still paying student loans which has to be for their kids when\nI I Would imagine a big chunk of it is probably for the kids you their parents plus loans or things along those lines and I know you've been kind of on the uh the edge of that battle saying look stay away from these parent plus loans\nAnd don't sign for your kids I mean either have the money or you don't and you know if they want to go to college in the city that's fine they can also join the military and get money that way\nThe other big thing is look if it's all well and good to want to support your kids get I don't have any so I don't understand it but here you always want the best but here's what I always point out\nIf you run out of money in retirement right eventually you're going to boomerang back with your kids and that's what I've worn my children about and I can guarantee you that is not what they want\nNobody's trying to stop it and it's up to four thousand people now it's estimated that this is costing somebody Twenty one million dollars these people have to be fan did they have to be transported and they have to use the bathroom\nThey have to be\nAble to drink water and whatever else they can get their hands somebody is making this happen somebody thinks that this is going to watch or gr well for Democrats\nWere told that George Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of\nKids by the way and the magic of the camera pan is the children as it always is there are children in the caravan\nAnd that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those I even had one major baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else is inside this guys we had one of those made than those bother you baby on ... rush maybe on\n... exactly when a rush maybe on board little inside the it'll a yellow sign we made it up and it was available to the Rush Limbaugh store\nBut this is the same thing children young children also we must do what we must open the gates we must stamp decide we must allow them passage\nSo we've got this we have the\nMueller report as I say more on that in a moment the mother report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd ... former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating it was Trump not let no man\nI go there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this was an organized bought and paid for invasion\nImage of growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them injury or to separate the children from the adults\nSo that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in the can where these people will say they're shocked that came to America to save their lives were their children and to improve their latest they won't let the man is is unlike anything they ever heard about it and\nThat cuts of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry Democrats think this\n\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically this would be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nWe don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something\nSomehow a massive group of four thousand people growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt just making patently obvious what it is is you're not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated it's planned It's MORNING paper somehow this is supposed to\nEnd up making the United states look bad that\n\nI'm not I'm not sure I ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nBy the we can't do it before the election because of regulations and this is something we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if mothers ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is is probably the exact opposite uh let me find the justices refined lease sounds I hear [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on one look at it is [noise] it won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room he's a counterterrorism\nCenter specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from other going over Rosen high let me play this out washing Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the indictment I really want to see what's in that narrative reports\nHey so this\nIs where this is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff\nTrump is none none of which is\nProbably going to be ... none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway\nUm but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt but it's not the indictment\nWhich\nThere is nothing less they make it up there never has\nBeen at least Trump collusion and there never has been the evidence or less they make it up [noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things\nA report on a on global wealth [noise]\nNow this is happening people are living it and I guarantee there's a party out there that's not happy about this the Democratic party all of this great economic news is threatening to them why would that be what about this could possibly\nMake any well question

staffer all over me telling me how great it was best ever you got to get back on TV I haven't heard one\nSuch thing today everybody's saying they didn't see it so\nI'm it must it must not have been all that hot folks as all I can tell you [noise] um [noise] 'cause I mean there are there are ... even stepping forward I asked ... I I see it I wouldn't even in a room\n[noise] ah yeah I I I don't know the things you had other things that you didn't see it I asked the broadcast engineers we couldn't see anything that crew equipment in the\nBack of our heads about your heads all we can see what about getting here no they didn't run in the audio in here for you mean they didn't run and he got to be the first time that his audio [noise]\nSo the point is nobody thirty witnesses and nobody saw a thing I could've punched him in the in the face given a black guy and nobody here apparently would've\nKnown it [noise] no I did not do that I have no cause I'm just giving it an example here\n[noise] ah [noise] so I [noise] I Can't\nTell you how it went [noise] I never ...\nWhat\nA in a break after it happened [noise] they bleep one thing I said they believed that I then I they told me handle they get very ... look there's something you said here they've got a bleep out\nHe told me what it was I'm not gonna tell you why should I tell you because it's not going to air anyway it wasn't profane it wasn't insulting or anything it just took it out\nTo different Fox Russia okay fine but I'm I'm just saying\nTalks you have to watch it yourself what about you rushed to I I never folks I never like myself on TV it's one of the reasons I don't want to do it\nEvery time I watch myself on TV all I say is damaged I should've said acts are should've added this or should I never have that reaction after a radio show every time I'm On TV [noise]\nDamn I should have said that oh darn it why didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something on a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember\nWe had a call here at this maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said\nI'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well back camp that camp that says it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death of these maniacs and that's why yard\nSigns and not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way so\nI have a video taken by it tend crew was worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that what a pup a pop up here just second this picture you're going to see is from a video\nTaken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy\nDemonic looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then are ripping it to shreds\nAnd at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was video showing him on his camera and got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStarts shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken a still shut up put it up there this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping them up out of yards\nAnd they're still shot he is storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't know shot that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow\nOf today's Democratic Party that is an illusion is all too real\nSo I'm trying to wonder why even the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not delusions they want you to know they want readers to know this left turn is by golly by gosh for real\nThe sub bad like many overnight sensations\nIt has been years in the making\nWhat we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years begins and Mr Thomas Bee ebbs all the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank of ... [noise]\n... up the Democrat Party elite\nSad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back ... Clinton the Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals\nAnd that's why some are scratching their heads anyway from two thousand one or two thousand eight team to share a democratic voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent\nThat here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money crafts ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party just simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this gross white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identified as liberal those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high\nFor Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis them African Americans now wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party owns white suburban women\nRight we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are but back in the mental shrimp boats were shown to be met for\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight [noise]\nKevin McCarthy ... handed force the lone\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands caseload ... criminal\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump's new\nThat's conservative was my\nSo health President Trump visits time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is build the wall and enforce the law\nPaid for by the Tea Party express [noise]\n\nMemory than what we have today on the free I radio I\nThink they feel how we found to focus on the scary fine with the heart radio original vision Halloween radio commercial free Halloween hits both wind and area [laughter] won't pick that perfect Halloween costume oh you're kidding\nFor victims to help you with all those activities we radio on I already I\nSaw [noise]\nAll right now look it's it takes a lot to get something passed me here we have McCaskill area filled reticent in Tennessee and we got to do over at work and we've got this guy tester\nIn Montana and they're all trying to tell us\nThat they're not wild liberal left just took their centrist and all this except we find out that's not really true and that but here comes Thomas Bee saw saying don't believe them this move to the ... after the Democratic party is real edits salad so Thomas Bee and Saul is giving\nHis own Democrats have been a problem he's calling them out\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty A.

I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand ill legal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for\nThis somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to\nBe using facilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used\nHere I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help the this is what got Donald Trump elected this is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion\nAfter southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\n\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe started by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan\nBut I'm struggling to see other than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump work there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this white they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThat afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you did in ... and just the second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up in South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them if they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been law reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called not a new disease is a disease out this has an outfit called the F ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's the same length and also killing American\nChildren back twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen I was out free ... let me say this to see the scene right as of now has not said they're not sure where it came\nFrom yeah twenty fourteen twenty sixteen we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm hiding a tough time finding the leaks out of the Internet 'cause it's just if you get a scrubbed on January fourth to twenty six key on a website called natural news that line red and Carol virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice right right right now\nThe CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much created to Trump's off for a walk\nIf somebody was actually tell you the truth and the drive by needed don't you think that this would have some effect on those moms with small children for\nA\nYeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how these things remain isolated\nThey are terrified of them\n\nThat in a nutshell Mr Limbaugh is the voter who was driving being tired Democrat Party\nOff the cliff [noise]\nThat from a woman in the audience who sent\nMe
