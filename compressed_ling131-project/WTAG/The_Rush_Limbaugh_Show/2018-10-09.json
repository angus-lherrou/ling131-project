help myself but we're now into for us and we're allowed to start thinking about it from at least a a earnings perspective and FAO Schwarz\nIs that making an international pushing also reopening their flagship store in New York\nA head of the season you know we we hear so much about everything going on line and bricks and mortar closing down but the fact the matter is\nBricks and mortar is still a great differentiate or for companies if it becomes a destination and let's face it everyone knows the FAO Schwarz\nIn New York City if you're drawing a blank here I didn't come along to yeah it's a tourist attraction exact\nAnd you know they are smartly in my opinion opening up again our ends at thirty rock you know right by NBC pretty good timing with toys are us just causing every single one of those okay hats and and you know like I said it's it's a tourist destination get people in there you know get a lot of talk a gay\nIt's definitely a ... that's a luxury toy brand new when they were open back when you'd have like personal shoppers and your hair you would have concierge type services so I mean it's Manhattan It's over the top it's that's what it's supposed to be\nAnd they're also going to pop up shops in Spain Australia and London for the holiday season people go in there and get some very nice expensive ideas\nAnd you know it's going to be the other interesting show among all the other companies that are trying to pick on the toys are us or you know abstinence um party city\nThey do get those Halloween yup shops that they do a ... year they're also going to do toys city ... they're going to take that same space that they rent for Halloween and open up these little toy pop ups shops\nTo try and gobble up some of the toys are us absence that we're going to have this year and a get a lot of people like to go these stores and see the stuff in person than a find out how goofy they look in those outfits or whatever you know and you know at whole foods doing what\nAmazon's giving up a toy brochures to whole foods shoppers ah okay here's the pressure and all that stuff and all the crap that we sell on Amazon dot com that you can buy for your kid that you know trying to grab everything in the store so smart move ... smart move getting these pop up stores people will definitely go there and they'll spend money and I think so [noise]\nThree housing trends to watch this fall job we've talked about the real estate market extensively and some weaknesses that we're seeing what what are we what are we should we be looking at this fall\nWill you know the bottom line is despite this huge recovery and you know and almost all of other recoveries the key issue was housing this is a recovery that's been fantastic and housing simply hasn't come on housing starts\nHave a have not done well housing stocks are doing very poorly right now\nAnd I suddenly keep an eye on to see the things could get even worse is can rates stay under five percent if they go about five percent it's going to walk a lot of people out of the market yeah a ... will prices ease up on the gas pedal a this is something to keep an eye on two we\nHave seen so this was three months in a row now where we've seen the year over your home prices the median home prices nationwide increasing it less than five percent and that hasn't happened since twenty fourteen so clearly we're seeing some deceleration anyway we're not seeing every adoption and home prices more seeing some\nDeceleration in the increase we're seeing buyers and sellers coming together and getting an equilibrium price that seems reasonable I don't hear the stories about Fifteen bids over asking price anymore exactly\nAnd I saw a number of I think is reflective of what's going on here the ratio at banks\nOf loans to deposits\nIs the lowest in forty years which means banks are sitting on a lot of capital and they're not lending it out and in part it's because\nA lot of people applying don't qualify because these prices are too high incomes don't justify it and on top of that has been a lot of regulations that have precluded a lot of one thing this is going to be an interesting issue as we go forward to get banks to kind of open up and start writing business because it was just the opposite extreme eleven years ago yeah\nYoung by her still really aren't in the marketing force ah twenty five thirty five year olds are thirty six point five percent homeownership rate\nThat still well below where Gen x ers were at the same point in time a number of different factors can point to whether it be student loans are not getting married yet still now millennials are not buying homes at the same rights that their parents and grandparents were buying them\nNowhere near but the trend here is encouraging because millennials are now starting to increase their share and I look forward I think a lot of this purchase has been delayed not put off\nUm and I think you can see a lot of people doing in the thirties with previous generations did in their twenties and it's going to be a huge boon I think for housing going forward\nI keep here everyone pointing to hey you know great news you don't need to put twenty percent down every you know everyone says oh you need you need to be buying a home with twenty percent down and\nThat's clearly not the true because not true because of all these programs that we have I really don't love these programs that exist though I mean I Know that they are important to get first time homebuyers in the house but the ... are we going back to some of the issues we saw back in the early to thousands\nComes out of the issue of scholarships for students going to college the more money your hand out the more prices actually go up you know the easy you make credit in terms of low down payments the more likely you are to get people to buy more house than maybe they should write and got\nVA loans guaranteed by the department of veteran affairs or require no downpayment right kind of agree with that one uh USDA loans allow people to buy rural homes without much of a down payment so\nI don't think we're running into an issue there but you something to keep an eye for an eye on it yet it's all the time we have today for the financial exchange stay tuned tomorrow or John Mooney Mike I'm showing ... sign off today than she turned into financial exchange radio network [noise]\n\nAnd that's our peak envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms on black do they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about your price from ... it's a price it actually\nMeans something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying\nSo you're saying she ... she believe both the foreigners was righteously\nIndignant offended over the white Trump treated mostly foreign ... gets confirmed that she can't handle it anymore now we don't know I'm just\nPointing out areas where she's publicly disagreed with the president\nPoppy Harlow had no idea what she was talking about nor did anybody you know what there is a classic example of they found out Nikki Haley I'm going to be approximate with the time here they found out that Nikki Haley was going to resign at ten o'clock and for an hour cable news had nothing but speculation as to why they couldn't just wait\nThey couldn't just wait for the announcement in the video tape from the oval office where she in Trump presented\nThe bright yellow chairs by the fireplace courtroom white nope adding to fill that time\nWas speculation and that's when people really get dumb when all kinds of wild guess speculation that's where people try to show their smarts folks\nThe ads were all these animals and commentators tried a demo there in siders status and their operatives knowledge and so forth some of the things that I heard being bandied about\nSimply made no sense but much of it as they say made for great TV [noise] it wasn't\nComplicated at all she just wanted to leave at nothing to do with Kavanaugh it had nothing to do with ... and had nothing to do with the Supreme Court it simply had to do with the calendar and something she had seven this was going to happen long ago\nI in terms of the um\n\nIdea that she's upset she before there's another rumor going around Sochi and now she's going to resign and she's going to run against Trump and twenty twenty this she hates prompt the ears of the barriers dumb Trump he just didn't get it and it\nAnd it's going to run for the Republican nomination in twenty twenty\n\nSo she headed that off at the past before the press even started asking questions is no I'm not running in twenty twenty the only thing I'm going to be doing is campaigning and supporting this guy and she pointed at Trump\nYou good to hear about when they come out of the sales collectively of the drive by media who were convinced\nThat a woman was abandoning Trump because of ... because of capital\nHere's our buddy nic Robertson about oh maybe all time favorite CNN foreign correspondent and here is a nic Robertson this morning on CNN I'm guessing back and forth with the info bay poppy Harlow about Nikki Haley's reason\nOn the issues that allies have wanted to see President Trump can be tough on ... in particular Russia because that was one that he seemed\nTo be sensitive on and not one that he wanted to push as allies in Britain and France and Germany or the whole thing states that have a one sentence Nikki Haley has been a source of conflict so if you're one of the United States Senate for Nikki Haley spent out in his position than perhaps you breed a tiny bit easier\nI look [noise] I\nI'm just I'm just a radio talk show guys here and Nick Robert so does this season broadcast journalist but I'm Sorry\nThis is so full of it let's go back to the top of his son ... on the issues that I'll buy as one of the street Trump be tough on in particular Russia because that's the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one but he's one of the push\nAs allies in Britain and France and Germany the Baltic states of all wanted to be tough [noise]\nHas it every button it can't be forgotten how Trump re ... Angela Merkel for making a deal a side deal at the G twenty with the Russians\nHave you gotten than it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians ended it was Angela Merkel of made a side deal with them for natural gas and it was Donald Trump that could not believe in and called her out on it and suggested that she couldn't have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G\nTwenty to G. H. G. Fifteen or the G whatever\nTrump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump Trump Russia collusion story had been discredited thoroughly Trump\nHas not been a Russian puppet quite the contrary but you wouldn't be able to convince nic Robertson up that\nOh no they got these ideas in their head trumping and Russia's got together they stole the election remember Hillary Trump is a Russian storage Trump has money 'cause the Russians sought to what Trump falls Russia because of that Trump therefore soft on Russia\nNow Nikki Haley is leaving and that means nobody's left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death as a total one hundred percent front to back top to bottom crock folks\nGuarantee our allies\nAre probably happiness you Nikki Haley go because she is tough and she is pro America she believes in America first just like Trump does not to the expense or at the expense of our allies you want your body brought along but\nShe's not a push up these people don't know what you're talking about\nThey get these notions in their hands these fantasies armies narratives as they called them and they are reality whether they\nTouch on the truth or not here is Trump and Haley with her resignation announcement in the bright yellow chairs I got emails today from people God I hate those chairs rush you got to tell them to get rid of the chairs I said are you telling me that's what you notice here\nYou're watching Haley resigned and Trump sitting next door and they got a great pressure going and you're telling me the chairs or to yellow that's what makes me think we've got no prayer we got no hope we have a serious thing going on in the oval office when I get emails all my God the chairs rush\nChairs\nThat was the way no chairs on radio folks because no pictures except those that I intricately paint for you with my clever use of urban diatribe rhetoric and residents here is a is it that soundbite Nikki Haley\nThe United nations has been very special she's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very important play with you also is somebody that has been [noise]\nAt the United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us on the campaign is really a long time very intense and she told me probably what she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of the two year period at the end of the year [noise]\nI Want to take a little time off I was so we're all happy for you in one way to lose say you're going to come back and someone may be a different kind of effect [noise]\nBut uh I just want to let you know the end of the year Nikky will be leaving [noise] um they will be in class and\nShe has been a great United States ambassador to the United nations she was a very good governor she is a solid quality person a she has done great work and this administration and as governor of South Carolina I Know a lot of\nPeople period I Know a lot of people in South Carolina who lived there love Nikki Haley she a ... is going to be a great loss she was fearless at the United nations she was on dawn and an unintended data and by that Star Wars bar scene\nA you know surrounded by a bunch a thug dictator tyrants in that room and she gave him the business and what for\nRemind my ... promotion ceremony will be held today for for Worcester ...

become what we're up against a to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as\nWe know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse and they made the civil war but but those were different circumstances a that was a specific argument I'm\nAbout cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America\nAs mountains in some people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I've I've uh just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bells and it may be present some\nAre solutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program and falls\nBack however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\nApologizing the cabin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling with people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limit on how low they will go on how good braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point would be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I\nThought [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in that rise\n\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles and our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the abs since ... presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had on the evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with\nThis then that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court the rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing and

to stop\nWe can't allow the Democrats back in\nIt isn't going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose this is the point you're right but it isn't ever going to stop until these people are so soundly

try to poke holes and whoever Trump nominated for UN ambassador is I haven't heard any names I haven't paid close enough attention to know who the names being bandied about might be\nBut they're going to do it on principle they're going to do it because they think it'll be a political advantage headed in the mid term showing once again the world but country doesn't think Trump is justified in all applied to be naming anybody that has desertion\nHe doesn't he doesn't deserve to be president we need to get rid of it and this is the whole foundation for which they are going to be have a anyway

everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked in America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality\nThis is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on an interest in and would always say\nA variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't\nShe couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aid coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you that they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death while\nThey would never say so publicly that would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have a Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as

ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column\nNine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaning Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSalt\nTo written nine seats firmly or leaning Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this\nIs a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is [noise] and yet they believe it now folks\nI don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans you know I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this dust with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nHas a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election\nNight two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you

them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\n\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informants smarter but that's gone\nWe have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with Avon so load block\nCab idiots\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing
