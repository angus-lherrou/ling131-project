{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "These name marvel empire they they cancelled that after two seasons 'cause you know it just wasn't a show that a lot of people really into so I think that like taking a lot of risks and you know many of them are paid off but it just a lot of money that they continue to span I think that is you know on state I'm all for the long term\nPulled one of the things that I find interesting here is this is a market overall this year that even though it's it's still up somewhat for the year it's market that's gotten cheaper because earnings growth has outstripped what we've seen as far as appreciation for the broad market\nNetflix isn't in that situation they've gotten the more adventurous and they're definitely not so their company even with this quarter you could make the case it's it's riskier today than it was at the beginning of the year still\nYeah I think that that is a very good argument I guess the counter that I Would add to that is that Netflix seems to be treated in this club like Amazon or you\nCan you be overvalued for two decades and that's really you know when it comes to Amazon ... always been over ... type yeah and it keeps going up and up and up and I think it's really just because\nPeople have faith in what Jeff phase of doing it and then the numbers kinda you know prove it with all the growth there and I think with Reed Hastings that Netflix you have a similar ah\nYou know argument this kind of a cult that the c._e._o. sort of a warship if you will people really seen that they can't do anything wrong\nPull in terms of competition for Netflix you know we we we were asking this earlier this week in terms of who the biggest competitors are\nIn my opinion one that's not a pure streaming service HBO just because they have that subscription model in a hundred and thirty million subscribers worldwide obviously they've they've got that good base that's already built in\nYou've got companies like Hulu you've got companies like Amazon who even though they don't put it out they still have a big streaming service who is the biggest competitor in your opinion for right now\nYeah it's a tough question I think what's really difficult to try and figure out with regard to competition a lot of people talk about how competition could be bad for any of these services\nMy counter to that would be that as long as the broader economy is doing well\nIt's not really a kind of binary option I Know that many people say well you know what I'm not going to subscribe to HBO even though I Love game of Thrones because I only can afford Netflix and I want to watch the final season of orange the new black I think people are\nVery ... consumers that\nStreaming content right now and you know most people I Know they they have an Amazon description for the Amazon shows they watch HBO they watch Netflix and you know various authors as well I think it is going to be interesting to see whether or not the Disney Fox\nStreaming service that launches next year\nTakes away some of the uh you know a traction from Netflix but uh you know even there I'm not so sure that\nAre going to drop Netflix just to go to it\nBut one of the things that's missing from Netflix right now if you get all these other services out there\nThey all have some other kind of live content they can offer whether it's you know Amazon has been Thursday Night Football games and some soccer games even Twitter has some of those uh you know obviously the legacy players like a Disney and Fox have sports news and things like that\nAny ... Netflix getting heavier into those areas because that's the one thing that seems to be missing from their portfolio right now\nYeah it definitely is something that uh you don't have right now but I think for the most part it's not something that I think ah you know they really feel a need to get into especially when you\nHow what streaming the streaming media explosion kind of at dawn to TV in general I mean live TV seems in many respects to be\nAn antiquated notion unless you're talking about a big sporting event or or some big news event the you know because of people's very busy lives time shifting is kind of what people do and you know you don't necessarily have to have an\nAppointment live TV yeah as a raw I think it really is more about having that attractive appealing content that you get to watch whenever you have time to watch it whether or not that's yep\nTwo o'clock in the afternoon if you work in the evenings or you know eight o'clock at night if you have a regular day job\nFor a good point we've got to run now but thanks for joining us have a great weekend and we'll catch up with\nYou too and I you might have some based on your future so\nLittle bit we are we ... we got a good one this year so uh just got to go to get things moving a little bit but we got a good one going on I think that's the big issue\nOut Dennis poll Monica from CNN Business talking about Netflix pick her on them as N. F. L. ex\nUh and uh let's do a quick way to look at markets years we head towards the top of the hour are still have positive movement and all three major U.S indices dial up Seventy six point Justin ... nine ... backup fourteen at the moment\nOil right now bumping up a little bit the sixty nine twenty nine less than one percent though gold at twelve thirty up ten cents an hour\nTo near U.S Treasury just shy of three point two percent of the ... pretty much hanging out in the same place has been for a while now so this is one of the overall when we talk about movement to this point I Know there's still you know four hours left in the trading day here relatively quiet to this point now yes\nBut they diverge in terms of tactics bin Laden decided to go the terrorists route and to show you want the mother ... Muslim Brotherhood route which is\nI mean it's pro violent but they actually ... their PR is that they attempt\n\nTo achieve their objectives within the quote unquote democratic process of the political process they want a United Arab world and the Saudis are the biggest problems that because the Saudis\nAre too close to the United states\nThe Saudis are the number one buyers of American weapons number one they spend more money by young American arms than any other nation\nThat might surprise you but it happens to be true the Saudis have also become recent allies with us and Israel against Iran\nNow don't laugh at this\nMaybe go back and look at Iraq Hussein oh who the drive by media loves\nWell Obama loved Iran and to Obama paying Iran one point eight billion dollars in power loaded cash\nObama signed the nuclear deal with Iran was essentially a pathway for them to achieve nuclear weapons Trump has since torn up that checked them off that's that's another rewind of an Obama policy\nSo if Obama loved Iran or thought it was okay at least to have an allied relationship with them or less adversarial then so just the drive by media\nBut\nNone of this about the show is designed it not not intended to they deserve to die don't misunderstand this just folks were were were between a rock and a hard place here every day\nWe're faced with a challenge the media picks a story that is their number one story and its purpose is very clear damage destroy\nWhatever as much as they can Donald Trump we\nHave to defend is at least I think this this is my reaction to all of this\nI don't want 'em taken Trump out I don't want to damaging Trump I don't want\nAny of this to happen this is all bogus I Want the trajectory this country has gone to remain I Want us to remain on that trajectory I Want to beat back\nThe insanity Emmy abnormality and the psychological disorders that have become the Democratic party I Do not want those people in charge and leaving and governing this country it will be a disaster if that happens\nIt will be an absolute just I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night who just beside himself over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York liberal by the way\nHe reformed about Twenty years ago he can't he can't\nHe's having trouble dealing with the possibility that the Democrats might win the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that a majority American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely\nDoesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in the cabinet situation\nBut that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system just fixed\nWhatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose\nOf government it really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution that the Democrat voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana ... why would we want that\nTo try amp\nWhat we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by shooting concerned it's an open an opportunity to blast\nTheme Trump to damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump the cave and abandon Saudi Arabia\nNot it's it's not that the drive by have anything on that Saudi Arabia is just to get from the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump\nInto going against his instincts they've been trying to do that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made their die to\nBe able to say they pressure Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because he's afraid of them and they think they're getting close when Trump's out there saying yeah looks like a show ...\nDied looks like it's a pretty good bet because she'll be they think they're getting close and they're all jammed up in their own ... and they're all getting more jazz for this that's why we tells you hook a show\nTaken as been sold in Massachusetts a visual say stop and shop in east where ham sold a million dollar winning ticket WG AJ sports baseball Dodgers that Milwaukee LA leads the N.

first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to

I can defend the pictures rush the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phones the patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five no I just rely on hope which was the gang naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this ... if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite lit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... cohost out there talking to famed Republicans strategic wrist\nAnd Rollins about my comment\nFans deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will add some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nYou are not buying into these are scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those but I Do I rent a congressional committee I've been doing a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those in the open seats as another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play was only about two or three Democrats seats are in place telling me on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally abs and I'm In a in a what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers\nAre based on data that is the result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six to eight I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj the Senate yeah we're probably pick up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage in anger there promoting insanity\nAnd lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and\nThey're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went over like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside\nOf that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in

taking my call\nUm I was calling I just wanted their show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought it was just great it's probably one of the best show ever hacked\nAnd we're really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business is you know small businesses and talk about\nHow they're doing you know and where they are\nSo yeah yeah you know you don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a um it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties\nFolks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of\nThis we took calls a\n... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it right and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were\nAll amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January one or ... or at least one\nMaybe with another a rip off from that other three day thing that that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday and Saturday were you know\nRepublican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people ... people would buy 'em\nWell don't don't were downplayed a Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something to do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nThat why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask well are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that\nRun an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work you know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country in some ... saying the backbone well\nOkay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone\nAnd not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... lost in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi how're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but it ... there's not a brick it's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen needs done too much into a little\nTime oh I don't either get at the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this\nCaravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals that we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Worcester", "day": "19"}
