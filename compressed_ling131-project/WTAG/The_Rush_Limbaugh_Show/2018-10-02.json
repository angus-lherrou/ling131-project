mattresses called\nPrices start as low as a hundred thirty dollars for a twin size bed I'm surprised it's taken Amazon this long to get into this because if there was an industry in the whole world right for disruption I Would think it will be mattresses is is one of the highest profit margin businesses on the planet yeah but I Want\nThe the reason I have there's a million companies are you in a box or ship it to your house ... release a top the needle you name it right there all over the place but I Will buy one and I need a mattress\n... cause I Want to test it [noise] yeah let me see I I think if you're interested in getting a high end mattress this is not the route to go though I I think you know going through a local store and paying you know Fifteen hundred thousand dollars plus you can find one that you'll like yeah\nI think what this is going to do though and I was shocked to talk about this as you know you forget the cheaper ones they're they're terrible like in that seven Ninety nine eight Ninety nine inch there's like a few that are good view that are terrible and it's a real hit or miss thing like you don't want to buy it online because a few people like where\nThings made in this state surgeon may Mexico or we're not company oh in general I I think not only two or three mattress companies that\nSupply literally all the mattresses in North America yeah um and I think mattress from owns most of it I think they're they're like they bought up most of their competition\nBut I think what this could do is if if he and his on gets into this and really disrupts the business\nThose Fifteen hundred to two thousand dollar mattresses the ... the higher quality mattresses might be available for like the mid range price but seven Ninety nine eight Ninety nine and I think if that's the case you know if I was in the market for a mid priced one\nI take my chances and also knowing that Amazon allows you to do returns\nYeah it's huge I mean how do you return it can cause I I mean that's obviously going to be the number one question across the board when ordering a mattress online John I'm sure they were you know address that with a simple solution um yeah but most of these companies are offering Ninety Days to try a mattress I think that's plenty of title it is absolutely I\nI Would agree with that but I I think it will be successful because they're because wherever there are large margins Amazon come in and disrupted them and there's no industry that as fat or margins than the mattress industry yeah well they're willing to lose money\nAmazon yeah they've shown that\nUh they become more disciplined about that in recent years which is one of the reasons why the stock is doing well but uh this is put mattress from out of business and then raise the price is right that that's that's how they do but the mattress companies are are making so much money you can go to small towns that have very little in terms of commerce\nAnd they have a beautiful mattress store in part because I was listening or freakonomics broadcast that said you could just like two or three ... week really and make pretty good money

D. and as I\nSay it was a it was a serious and important step toward globalism and subordinate in the United states to world tribunals like the world Trade Organization uh and the international criminal court in this kind of thing it was not making America great again it was not putting America First\nNAFTA and deals like it is the kind of thing that establishment types\nSee as their purpose and their expertise this kind of thing these kinds of trade deals and promoting globalism gigantic world structure a world order that McCain often spoke about this is why they are in there\nAnd it's gone\nFar I'm telling you foreign policy wonks is not getting any coverage is Kevin O's morphing everything but I'm here to tell you that all these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die by such things as NAFTA\nAre beside themselves that Trump got this done [noise] it is a huge middle finger to them\n\nNow to Bill Burton is just pray Limbaugh show talking about trade not Kevin Kevin O's not inspiring anybody how can anybody listen this program I think that\nCreating NAFTA took these people years Trump got sick\nHe replaces it in months and do an insult to injury that Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it they ask to be part of it are noses or not out of joint they're not crying and moaning about the loss of NAFTA they want in on this new Trump deal and that is also\nProfoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers they can't feast right this is just more hatred for Trump this is just it's blinding them\nAnd now\nThere's a companion story didn't have a chance to get through it yesterday the child comes\nAre getting ready to lower their trade barriers on us exports because of Trump's tariffs it's all working\nThis is something these guys never even tried to do\nTo straighten out the trade imbalance with the times the swamp rollers never even tried to do that that was just\nAnother circumstance we had to accept in the modern world and watch what's going to happen next I'll tell you right here in now Iran is going to come to the table you watch when that\nHappens this is all falling into\nPlace for Trump exactly as he said exactly as he\nIs making happen\nI don't know how many of you do wire transfer is but there is a form of wire transfer called swift and if you're goes ahead and puts on a replacement for sweat Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians are using it meaning it may have trouble moving their money around\n[noise] [noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal in so many\nWays it's a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for Trump making America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply committed in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top three\nCampaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people tried to get into the trumpet Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done ... ... ... ... that the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah\nScrewed Trump for doing it but they they don't have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump's supporters remaining ramped up\nAnd loyal and then there's this\nOne more song by featuring your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans have have it all went down if he was defeated or the fourth or with raw that that would just she ended up Republican turnout because the quarter is there a holy grail and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here to say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut is that is going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate you think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say\nYou see what happened to Kevin all wearing the majority that we couldn't get to confine you need to come out in\n... how does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down it will be because moderate Republicans decided not to vote for him and that could depressed turn out in some ways that could lead to a number of people saying what's the point\nThe point I was making is and I I've been hearing this from a a lot of people that if Kavanaugh goes down this is going to fire up troops because Republicans are saying and trying to make it happen and if if it goes up here but\nI ... I understand the thinking but it just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why don't we have\nTo use in order to win I never understood that\n\nWhy do we have to lose Kavanaugh in order to gin up turn out I I\n[noise] depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when Jenna turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and they go to the voters say we're not majority we tried we tried but we couldn't get him confirmed you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in the\n... and there's a disconnect there [noise] anybody\nHeard the name of Chris theme watcher named Christine fair Dr Carroll Christine fair anybody heard of her\nLet me tell you who she is she is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown Georgetown's not an insignificant university Georgetown has the same Georgetown University was the nucleus the center\nOf the movement to give a women as much contraceptive help as possible birth control pills as far as the eye can see Georgetown was the center of that movement and this\n...

you'll be able to see it there\nUh but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed a cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it under sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a southern angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out there is no Fox News there is no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative website just start everything's starting to ... to to block it at that point but\nBut this program nationally was still at four years after our

accept that would challenge the White House lawn and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia\nShortwave radio this is the by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht\nI think it was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine an artist at his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right

that point talking about the wisdom of his ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter] some public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my

not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just good flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\n\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point\nSo don't dumped me on this sense of what these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about it as high just did\nOn CNN NBC News desperately\nTrying to convict Kevin all at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia NBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat\n\nOn able to independently corroborate what makes claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweating ticket parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was a tenant parties where Campbell on his buddies running rape trains gang rape trends I Can't find anybody who saw what's what it was a college student when Kevin on his buddies rifles students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school party and\nI keep going back to the gang rapes if that's what's happening to these parties your lawyers center that\nHer lawyer said that she was doing research\nYeah Julie sweat and they kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me there look NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw sweat Nick at parties with capital Capitol Hill said he doesn't know sweat Nick and his called her

only about a year but\nBeen through a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't know where when she doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything other than capital there's no credibility in either to sweat\nSweat that gives a credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible there is no credibility on the allegations side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night uh Laura Ingraham show on Fox News\nJulie you swipe next ex boyfriend or Richard menacing details why the bird Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable Venice assessments what never mentioned having been sexually assaulted the em\nYeah ex boyfriend that Julie sweat Nick at third woman to make

Venice the sweat and they told him at the time I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys\nSo I think as represented by Michael ... who didn't immediately responded to Fox News requests for

is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism so\nOn good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talk English Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they have been given a free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge we're in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ms ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if I catalogue perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is actually throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah are they friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear that guy's got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for\nI just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you know there's dozens of leaking this\nLetter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the Florida ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it
