there are ...\nMuch is the Washington establishment would like to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump in the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the caravan\nThat tells me that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be\nCovering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure [noise]\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting there was not born of any evidence that could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he\nSeparated families the border and how Trump didn't like the ... I didn't want to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you have a piece yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them in their not publicly saying this but I Know that\nThere\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one the issue that's good separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right word but they wouldn't be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\n\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\n\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states\nTwo thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what conveyor politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see pictures\nOf of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it I mean look at random video you might you might see some people really think of I mean we don't see how this is being handled we\nDon't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay the people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they have been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nThe caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten\nIt points they already qualified\nFor asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this is the left\nBehind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nI'm they were also the

weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members\nOf the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the Caribbean by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what Tom ... secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm payout so they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world wouldn't want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's\nCakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this and they ... they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals\nThemselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to\nThe young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best for being driven soulmate by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of\nLife and having a masked a bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting ends allowing males well just a race of the border and say to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get into the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look

an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing as sending in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's palm pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd things that we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor\nCan call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nYou he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he\nCan't this is what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside for seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms I joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike and Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring them back for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in something\nThough that sort I mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump\nExactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is about the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nLike

because it's still works it's still rile people up it divides us horrible\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's

of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does that I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows when he's

Ramos or whatever\nIt is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and\nHe's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want us a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want\nWe all have these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy balance\nLike their buddies in the Democratic party and there are a leftist donors have nothing to do with this why this thing just happened and Trump and we know this because we looked at research data the media says Trump made a big deal out of immigration and two thousand sixteen and he's doing it again\nWhy don't you people go all the white and accusing Trump of putting together this caravan\nI've been waiting for the meeting to try that I've been waiting for somebody in the drive by just suggest that Trump or the Republicans might actually be behind this\n\nThey quote Trump from his rally last night the Democrats don't care what they're extremist immigration agenda will duty or neighborhoods or your hospitals are your schools\nThey don't care that the mess calming will totally bankrupt our country and then they\nQuoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting they come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nAnd these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked asked if the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWhich he has doubled down on by the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] who they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that they they attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up in a group of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nThat are worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense it makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourself\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times out Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mueller has been God's so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies got bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital of thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked at the it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're\nJust fit to be tied\nOver it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better

is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on you you watch cabinet to blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what couldn't you'll be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to

for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that\nCame out during his presidential campaign to Russia to they'd even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nGoing along along those lines if you want to look at it that way\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it

going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there is a big blue whale based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their
