CNN taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise] [laughter]\n... lemons that is it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo about all the\nRecent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another hate filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is\nI mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching\nMedia responsibility to the actions of people even notice how quickly they want to do that notice\nHow quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority of media you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of\nThis while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you in the sense\nWell there are cops and they missed reading their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me the Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was just in the wound to people Steve squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nGreat longer hear it again someday if it's such wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down two days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia\nAnd was all over for about a month and a half a non stop\nAnd we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\n[noise] yeah where did it go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nDay how I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when the other side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just got to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there\nAnd ah this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then they had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even asked a former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemember that you remember that\n... certainly remember that Americans are ...\n... ... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlets whether it's Yahoo\nGoogle CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what ... wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a\nHeadline news maybe where Monday morning well more than the headline news\nHeadlines they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program but\nI just found it to kill your that that was not one ... usually any on the plane goes to kill him that many people especially if it was a brand new planning the outlet\nWhen are you such a brand new playing what kind of plant was he says Boeing will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the um you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news is still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a double wide\nBody and\nNot as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed entered the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... so\nThat no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nRush Limbaugh because we know for you the best school do

[noise]\nNo it's all these news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG men double duty ADHD Worcester and I hardly radio station\nCampaign ... is President Trump kicks off eleven rallies in eight states later today outside Fort Myers Florida we're Fox has that been brown is live at the herd Serena [noise]\nElissa the president comes here tonight to rally support for his political allies in Florida and there's already thousands waiting in line to see him Sandy Shaw wants to hear him speak on one particular issue\nFrom their customers consumers that any other business out there any other retail business I think the news business\nAs people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does\nDon't know if one I don't know of a business\nWho ... who who reject half if not more of their\nConsumers are customers like the news business does but the news media has a habit that it was is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption ... whenever they thicken wherever they care about is what\nEverybody thinks or everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if that momentum was interrupted ... imaging level declined and wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers yeah Fort\nMyers are thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election and he is pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy\nMoribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy [noise]\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always\nMessages and he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this\nWhatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his ...\nIt doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it is wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of\nThis momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis was you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's going to happen on election day and I don't believe in the ... does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the uh not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close to me that we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Portland should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this just this is a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nIt's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies\nThe American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea\nOf the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people\nIt's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs it why is it why is it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the\nDesign that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today [noise]\nSpeaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford what her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present as any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets convert gets ... get the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rates serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nDont for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true that they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice they\nWould be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if\nKavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made laying eyes to terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all of okay we've got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy and Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if Kavanaugh confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nMurders conspiracy and racketeering he was killed yesterday in federal prison in West Virginia just hours after he was transferred there a crash involving a motorcycle and a car and they'll ... seats in West or last night leaving to people injured they have a grand reporting passengers at the cars that they felt the impact\nAnd saw the motorcycle flying by but didn't see any sign of that\nBefore the crash the accident remains under investigation and I'll be celebrating the red Sox World Series victory with accustomed version of it is well known boots I mean based retailer may do this with my father and blue rather the red Sox team color is a gift to the players and fast\nTo get the latest news twenty four seven active duty AJC dot com and keeping the faith news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ...

Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much I close my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession as he was becoming mine I handle I started writing my class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is one needs and millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our ... come on in the way the Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nIs specially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when that\nNow wants to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing that check coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back to ship had to pay for your pet act to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quick not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you realize\nThat what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to you tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paved streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people we want it only strong me healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will all how a lot of everybody not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books\nTo oh wow you know very was hurt\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history ... all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph to Abraham Lincoln you John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in and American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's then as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this good but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe we're a much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be helping we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHad to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love what America\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over [noise] the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one more than any technical\nAdvanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect of it would be as good as most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled\nIt just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who've been brainwashing propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this this folks\nI talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by hundreds of protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not since ...\nWhat does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump first lady\nYou Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shooting\nThat\n\nAre coming over here which is why they hate or\nThat you know [laughter] I Can't keep having chances\nYou will not see this on any network

[laughter]\nThat was a male employee looking at Jared Kush nursing nobody ever heard of you laughing at his wife was a bigger star\nThat's fine no problem with everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program it this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers waving a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates ... everybody's spices Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait to vote for Democrats\nSo the Trump can't do anything you know everybody wants the Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by maybe\n\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see those videos you last year that audio and\nThe wealth of the reasons one of your personality or caused by Rush Limbaugh\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration law\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight and\nKevin McCarthy ... ended for solo\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands caseload appeal lives in Brooklyn\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump\nThat's conservative congressman\nSo Alfred I'm Trump visit time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law ...\nA four by four [noise]\nWhen's the thirty first happy\nAnd turn on your soundtrack for\n[noise] [noise] read\nDoes it play and have a ... time radio and I already check it out now\nWe trying to make a little on\nThe weekend comes [noise] we got the experts to help you hang onto it\nThis is rich car host of the financial freedom show nine AM Saturday here on news radio W T H E financial freedom Iran I don't like when I returned money one news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine FM double duty H. G.\n\nWells CNN was the first to do it a month ago CNN declared the Democrats have won the house because one of the polls Nancy Pelosi is declaring victory in the battle of my house\nShe was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until today I wouldn't have said in the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now is we will when we when we will win the house\nNancy Pelosi\nPredicting a house that was already been won by the diver so no need the Democrats to vote in\nThe country and the ... just six days left for both sides to make their case to the mid term elections President Trump will hold eleven rallies\nEverybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that\nThe closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court the Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the renowned\nPoll analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day and I got to read the whole thing of print out the four pages bought the headline to hear uncertainties loom as ...\nIn terms and her final stretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as ... terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of up to twenty five to two hundred Ken Democratic majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any ... because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not Mr trend days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the racist can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other couldn't be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and I swam Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr print day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point but the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't is it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\n[noise] and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable aren't on the thing\nAnd then the next ... are we relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next ... what is it early voting\nTelling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what good at the polls but here at the end of this four page story what else is working out very well that's\nProbably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens\n\nWe are well set up for such an event you out on the bottom line I happened to us why this idea what's going to happen but\nMy job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise] and this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence analysis you can muster\nOkay here is real election meddling this is the Marsha Blackburn ad that Google\nHas prevented from being run Google is not allowing this and this is this is the at fourteen seconds listen\nTo her [noise]\n\n\nAnd the tagline there is stop the mob vote Republican and this ad has been the subject of censorship\nOr from Google or other the other guy is that what what did they say it is it's\nA it's a [noise] I dunno it's\nUnfair I forget the term they use but the reason is effective it's effective against the left and so Google\nIs a man and get those are the kinds of things that people are up against and if there's a journalist David ...\nWho ah who writes at a quote on his work here a bunch of time and he's out saying something that I have\nMentioned on this program countless times and I ... the Democrat Party is the drive by media and vice versa drive by meaty is the Democratic party they\nAre they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power a behind the Democratic party to Mr ... you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was an Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are succinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and it I mean way be unbiased if if that's true if a number of these things are true then they're convert will be a major surprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this in the bag\nNow the latest headlines from
