stunt who's behind it and for what purpose\nI've seen some people today who think the Republicans are behind this to try to scare Democrats away from going to the polls\nThat's a new one on me that just doesn't compute that that's not the kind of thing Republicans do\nIn fact you remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning this the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out the guy as a Democrat and condemning the Democrats are this actually said that this is about all of us Republicans just don't have a behavioral history\nLike this so it's a political stunts who is behind it and for what purpose\nWell the cabinet thing was a set up but it looked real for a while the Kevin off thing was a set up from the get go we of course here at the E R B network knew that\nAbout a lot of people thought it was real on ... it was

Democrat they tried to screw a Republican out of the election and I\nMean these are all things don't we know and it wasn't just a handful of rogue FBI agents involved it was the top tier leadership\nThe one thing that we know to be true the Democrats are pulling out all the stops they see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\nIt's October [noise] another way of looking at this\nFor the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR all of these angry mobs and I don't care what anybody thinks those angry\nMoms are not good for the Democratic party knows angry mobs are not going to stop turnout those angry mobs are not sending a signal to join us\nMuch as the media would like to portray about or was and much of the Democrats would like to portray of otherwise the people of this country do not want to spend all day and all night everyday enraged and angry\nThat's not what life is to most people and they don't want it to be that but that's what life is for your average Democrat today in ... angry upset certainly unhappy\nNot content\nAnd they were hoping to win elections based on that there hasn't been a single that I've heard a single statement of condemnation for any of these acts\nCommitted against Republicans by Democrats mobs people who have been caught on tape threatening Republicans' in restaurants\nPeople who

and Obama never got to their homes just F why are we still condemning them don't misunderstand\nThe bombs were intercepted by the postal service at one of the distribution centers so they were discovered very quick and to bomb that was sent to CNN didn't even get sent to the right place in\nTerms of where people work at CNN and it was addressed to John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN

it's your party forgive me that is encouraging this kind of thing it is the Democratic party that's home to all of these mobs it's the Democratic party and Mrs Clinton herself\nWho said that being on

not Republicans that show up for example\nAt the offices of the family ah well but it's a well the pro life groups offices some guy shows up in with a gun and it was going to shoot people got caught before he was able to shoot if fans Family Research center I think yeah Republicans just don't do this kind of thing even though every event like\nMass shootings remember every mass shooting the areas that Democrats in the media to try to make everybody think right off the bat that some\nTea Party or did it or some talk radio fan dated or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the

election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real\nClear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting\nThere is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it\nIsn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half so two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor\nTrump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate\nSide ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump gender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past because of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is a great unknown

telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWould it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more poor going it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is a big blue way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nThen the things that are supposed to cement

Miller\nAn FBI agent looking into city corruption who was posing as a developer they've been looking in ... Andrew Gillum corruption as mayor of Tallahassee for years\nAnd there were a lot of Democrats are very worried that this was going to come out if he did indeed win the primary fights and become the Democratic nominee which has happened that this Santas campaign\nPounds to see Republicans always ... in the media Republicans towns Democrats David but Republicans ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes to the Santa statement that the Andrew Gillum has repeatedly lied about taking free gift and trips from lobbyists to feel lie about these gifts and trips and lobbyists on national TV what else\nIs he lied about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target and or a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly given vague answers to questions about who paid for the New York city trip is avoidance of a direct answer became pronounce during his someday debate on CNN with the census\nAnd give 'em just have this essay multiple you pay for the Hamilton take it's not a lot of people want is a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nSky won't tell the truth about it is the big ...\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nIn too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and er and other things is willingly a desirous of sticking them\nAnd it's a [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interests and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is headed to ... to to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence\nAnd it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum with this clear to lead as his overall edge in public polling Wyoming do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so Gillum is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard ones left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collecting he looks things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leads the inequality an unfairness\n\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national income these these kinds of things that\nIf ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening

solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\n\nNow on TV I think it was this morning he was on on Fox and he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum\nHe pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch him for breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled them of the young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of cloud or investigation ever since he won Florida it'll be a sanctuary state\nHe wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic\nAmerican socialist do believes America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault because we have a hog than stolen too many and too much of the world's resources and we imported at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWe have stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there's nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all out David now and the guy is a classic throwback he is\nA walking talking Iraq Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nAny if you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum\nIt was not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over this country and in many places they are finding the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise] I'll tell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third team in her Senate race she
