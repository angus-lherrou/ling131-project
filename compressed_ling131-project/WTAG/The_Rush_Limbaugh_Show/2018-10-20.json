{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Wow so he was able to proceed with the action I don't have the answer as to how it went but he was looking for one point two million I'm In need you to find that answer of how it went to keep us posted on that one first of all I'm not sure how you run up a one ... one point two million dollar bill even at seven years of fulltime caregiving\nRight seems a little high ... I mean even if it's a hundred thousand I well I mean he could have lived there could have been twenty four seven twenty four seven care and it's and it's a hundred and fifty thousand a year you're I guess you're getting there\nI Would think he'd have much of a case if you're not going to complain about not getting paid for seven or eight years I Know I kind of a accepting your fate here but\nAgain that isn't really the point of the point of that stuff goes on every day and I think this was obviously a stranger not a real not a family member yeah I didn't care but I think when he just\nSpend some time on certainly if it's a stranger I just say family members step up look out see you know see who is this person is that it's caring for your loved one and make sure you've got your hands on the ... yeah\nUh but what about all the family members that are providing care for other family members that are moving and I think we need to add that fact pattern yeah to this case and explore that a little\nBit and I think you share with us last week Todd that there are more than thirty five million\nUnpaid family caregiving so you need to listen up for this folks because this is great advice Todd's gonna give you he's also giving you some great advice and writing with his guide that he has written for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust\nThere's so much that you're supposed to know about what should and should not be in your ear evoke about trust so that it works it's all about the drafting folks but how are you supposed to know what should or shouldn't be in there you don't\nFortunately for you Todd who is our elder law expert\nHe's written this guy that will give you everything you need to know including what must be in their sixteen different problematic provisions that should not being there and he's also included a question and answer pretty comprehensive section on how these trust work every day\nYou can make quest you're free

our website legal exchange showed dot com you can download your guide you can download our podcast and you can meet your questions for Todd the answer on the air\nSo how does it work if you're you know a loved one providing care I think you have a lot more to worry about in this case a oftentimes you're not worried so much about the stealing or they're not getting paid in fact lots of times you don't even want to get paid right um but the parent wants to\nPay yeah a lot of times they do 'cause you might be reducing your hours at work you're all circling the wagons you're all pitching in well you might even give up\nYour job right here for our parents fulltime and you need you need a financial flow of money yeah so so if you're going to do that folks then why we're not worried so much about the elder abuse part of this case or the criminal aspects of this case\nWe're worried about the future medicate application you know things that you do well you're living ... out of normal acts of kindness goodwill actions that you take your don't always realize the impact that might have on a future medicate application\nSo if you're a parent that you're caring for ends up going into a nursing home\nRight ... and you can't uh you get to a point where it's beyond your capacity yeah they might need to do it acute medical care or effective so so what do we do in the interim what we want to get paid if you want to get paid you must have a personal care contract\nEspecially if you're a ... a family member doing right you need the personal care contract\nAnd you need in the personal care contract to itemize out the kinds of services you think you're going to be providing\nFrom running errands to doing medical prescriptions to doctor visits to uh things around the house and the type of care you're actually going to provide for the loved one whether toiling transferring bathing medicating okay put all that and\nAlso you need a paragraph in there about the hours you think you're going to be spending ... and how you're going to get paid\nWhether it's twice a month whether it's every week and the hourly rate what's a good rate do you think taught as a guide lies you know I've seen enough fair hearing decisions come down on this that that hourly rate for a non\nA nurse practitioner right you're just a family member you know stick around twenty dollars an hour okay I think you'll be okay but even at twenty bucks an hour if you've moved and you can justify a lot of time\nEspecially if you don't have another job and so you could be moving you know five thousand a month out sure easy um and if you're doing that you need to then not only have the personal care contract with all of that information in it\nYou need to then make sure that you take the money and deposited in your account\nAnd reported on your personal income tax return okay so it goes through that process as ordinary income that those two steps the contract and the reporting it on the income tax return converts this from a non from a loving arrangement where you're not expecting to get paid ... an actual\nYou know I expect to get paid proposition yeah\nAnd you might even have the parent issue a ten Ninety nine ... at the end I read it as a gift right we want to make sure so there's no gifts so that if she does get sick and goes in the nursing home later\nThe transfers are not considered disqualifying transfers there is no five year penalty period you've cleanse that and you get to keep what you weren't in the end you're faced with just a last minute planning for for the love on at that point\nYou know folks you need to have a solid plan in place Todd's guide that he's written for the month of October it's designing and income only ... trust\nIt will show you how these trust are working and it's all in the drafting\nThis guy shows use six different um ... must be included in your trust and sixteen different troublesome\nProvisions that you want to make sure

and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need doing expanded to include in South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they\nAre very very wary of this the Indians themselves\nThe Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit engine they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus us in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this\nAnd they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten that wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present Hervey kept having to take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate a future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and fill out the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave\nThere's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house in a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nAre you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe out\nThe Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two\nThousand six needle elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTen the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor rock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral process of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what\nIs this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nIs going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democrat Party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it in common sense there is no return peasants\nAnd anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nYou'd never Trump ... but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen that Democrats attempt on cabinet\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing out in his career\nIn front of us a stadium or arena sized crowds\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation that he simply is not used to has I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely\nBy holding steady in this fine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is with the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin on\nRepublican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and one of the four of them\nSay they want to be president now\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nI'm do

about this\n\nNow I'm not a Dennis ... of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people find the time so tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quotes and make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested and which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nI mean it's laughable it is pathetic and I think\nThis is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each it ever doubt they're saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica limit no no no no no no it was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult so\nHillary Clinton is making any asset myself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meat to move but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be barking on what\nA stadium chore or yes bill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had a number of the the Oregon was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe wing of Donald Trump you know what this is like is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart pants\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show or the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed and inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program than Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened every attempt\nTo supplant take over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nThe kind of crowds that they want you may think rush there aren't enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the images there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that what we're going to find out\nCommon sense will tell you Hillary Clinton could withdraw fly highest or book selling party she couldn't drop ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would've been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones\nBig crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear
