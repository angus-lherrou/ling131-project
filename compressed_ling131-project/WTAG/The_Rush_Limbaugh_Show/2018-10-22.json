{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "[noise]\n\nTime to talk cars and we're joined now by Antwon Goodwin from seeing that road show here to talk about the twenty ninth teen Toyota Avalon Anton thanks for joining us today\nHey how's it going we're doing well so I took a look at the apple and just because I always liked to you know look at the cars before we talk about him\nMy first question is what happened to the front of this car because it kind of looks like a giant mouth driving down the road facing right at you what what's the thought on the styling or well the\nEvelyn front end is ridiculously aggressive this year I think that's the way it is making some large steps to kind of get away from the boring brand that sort of base\nReputation that it had and it might have gone a tad far on the Avalon if he if you look at it from the side from the rear maybe even from certain angles and kind of see what they're going forward the aggressiveness but no one that I Know I really think that it worked out well for them\n[noise] so let's get past kind of what the front end looks like a let's go first under the hood ... what what kind of engine do we have what what are we work with in terms of power there\nYou've got a couple of options are the main option for most people are going to be a three hundred horse power of effects engine that actually feels really good in this car\nIs going to be made it with a pretty smooth automatic transmission but if you are the kind of person who wants to get fuel economy and you don't really care about having three hundred horse power you could step down to about a two hundred horsepower\nA hybrid version that's going to get you around forty three forty four miles per gallon so if you're\nConcerned with like a mood comfortable right go hybrid if you're looking for something more power or for passing the veep stakes is definitely a style it up and\nWhat about when when you get inside of this the Avalon is is you know Toyotas luxury cars that they make how close does it get to their brand elections in terms of overall quality and in the comfort that you can get from this\nWilliam period actually my favorite part of the ... um it's actually in the limited trend where they've got really nice leather really nice details like stitching and stuff like that uh\nThe interior of the other line in my opinion a is about as good as what you're getting a Lexus yeah and so it kind of makes it a little bit of a toss up between whether you want to pay more for the likes to stick it lightly better fit and finish a or if you're really happy with what I Would argue\nThey called it very luxurious interior and you have a lot is that most of the building with all that you can expect from a Lexus or something comparable but for a little less money\nWhat stands out as far as bells and whistles there anything in particular that stands out as far as uh the technology that's available in the car\nWell the I Belong to make the um steak instance we standard though you're adaptive cruise\nControl your lane keeping hearing is this your life by monitoring all of that standard teachers for twenty nine the model year so you don't have to pay extra\nTo get any of those things anymore where some of the competition you have to check on like a few thousand dollar Stacey package to get something like that so out of the box you got pretty much everything that you could want as far as a driver aid and comfort technology for long highway cruises are slugging through traffic\nUm and the only thing that you'd really have to pay more for then would be nice or things like ...\nIt's what what are we looking at in terms of cost on the novel on where do you start in how how can you end up\nOn thirty five for the based model which again still comes with\nAll of that state the technology and is still a really nice looking car on the inside at the very least\nA top of the lawyers in around forty three depending on whether you go to the effects are high right there in about the same range they've done an interesting thing where they had a sport there trends though that you can either go forty or you can go luxurious then at the end of the day you don't end up paying too much more you just have to decide what kind of car you want\nFor good Antwon we've got to run but thanks for joining us and we will catch up with you soon\nThat grabbing\nThat is Antwon Goodwin from seeing that road show talking about the twenty Nineteen Toyota\nAvalon pay forty grand for one of the ugliest cars on the road that is just a sinful to log in am I wrong in that if it does not look good to grill I I looked at it and I'm like a big mouth coming at you it just an hideous hideous yeah\nCan I offer my two cents on why they did it sure to stand out it's cheaper to build grilled than to build the near the bumper nor my I Wonder if it improves\nLike the the weight of the car which helps smile\nAnd I bet it's stuff like that that actually poison as well because it does not look and I'll tell you that no it was like you said it looks like an open mouth ... the rest of it like the rest of the car actually looks pretty nice but you see the front of it and you're like\nWhat's going on there is part of the ... did the bumper fall off like what would happen\nTo a tough sell that that's it's it's hideous I don't think we're going to see a lot of these on the road you know and and you know the thing is people don't want to buy sedans and the first place no like sedan sales\nHave fallen a you know beat people want these SUVs these us yeah that either the full size ... size or you know if you have a family and you got a lot of kids you're buying one of those dance your your that that's what people are doing\n[noise] yeah the Avalon historically if you look at how many vehicles they are still per year\nAh it doesn't look like it's done particularly well recently it's declined for about forty eight thousand and twenty sixteen uh it's gonna end up being around thirty two thousand this year than actually twenty fourteen ... been around sixty seven thousand and not going to be many next year I'll tell you that they're they're struggling with the you know being able to get to grow sales\nAnd they're going to work you know maybe they won't they maybe they just show them the back half of the car you know that it's a little easier to sell it does look at the front what if we have your deposits you can just tell the\nBackup ... we'll often holy smokes a Dallas down a hundred and eighty two point that's a good\nMass acts up for some reason it's a twenty four point the SATs down twelve Russia's a four point price of oil is down ten cents a barrel at sixty

heading for the southern us border noxious John decker live at the White House\nThis and here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hid it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting it was not born of any evidence there couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan trucking north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening not seven\nThousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats if there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like the infant didn't want it but last so he did what he could change\nAnd north Andover that at the Massachusetts environmental police is out of a job colonel James McGahn was fired on Friday after previously being

one more with\nLouie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my goal claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when we have a\nParty a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report\nAnything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind wouldn't want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who won their right mind would promote this and wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else\nSo Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement to many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any rope Rick of common sense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense\nTo support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nChanging lives do math schedule you know off again first visit one of our nine hundred scientists today

qualified to join us in first the first ever I heart radio podcast and watch live from Los Angeles January Eighteen years old now and I are not divorced dot com\n[noise] I'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... by the media to make it look like I was trying to make it\nTastes like a show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it ah in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here is the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor\nThing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there is no law says he can't\nThis is it about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks that the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized says the border they if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side to Mexico where they tried to stop what's on military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump since a military dollar they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what would you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot of different ways\nWill be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nSeem to get off\nRussian by be Mitt work\nVoters have a choice on election day liberals want open borders and we'll make our nation I think she worried for criminal aliens Republicans went to secure our borders and make our country safer for law abiding Americans Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans just introduced a bill to fully fund President Trump's border wall the build the wall enforce the law act\nProvides nearly twenty four billion dollars to keep the sea from drugs terrorism and gang violence but Democrats wants to protect criminals in sanctuary cities in sanctuary states no matter how many Americans are intact deal more become addicted that's\nThe Democratic dream that we must die when you vote vote for Republican Congress how President Trump congressman Kevin

responsible for the content of this advertising before by majority committee pack\nAnd not authorized by any candidate for candidates committee were more a whole village already dot com\n[noise]\nAnd we have some interesting calls way and then you hear a false in a couple up there a couple of callers really really\nWorried about this [noise] after Trump's not going to be able to stop this and that the military\nIs trained for this and we have some people on the phones or think this could go south\nPretty fast and wrecked and ruin everything we'll\nTackle this and much much more when we get back after an obscene profits time [noise]\n[noise] hello [noise] unity here with a learned the patient to my neighbors who likes to bank loans if recent changes to your bank ownership has you feeling less

number D I F\n[noise]\nThey're not stopping me sobriety Fox News said a caravan of migrants heading for the southern us border has grown larger along the way I says Rachel Sutherland live in Washington we sound like seven\nThousand people many from Honduras are pressing on towards the U.S border in spite of threats and President Trump this morning that criminals and unknown middle Easterners or part of the care than this migrant says he hasn't seen any middle Easterners and he doesn't believe criminals are part of their groups\nPolitico had a story over the weekend warning Democrats not doing expect anything from Mahler not when it comes to Russian collusion\n\nBe prepared for a major disappointment Washington Post with a similar story\nAnd there are similar stories on the on the midterms in the blue wave about how it's looking less and less likely and more and more toss up up for grabs as Republicans strength is surging in places that it was not seen earlier\nAnd this is shocked and surprised the Dr ... and their polling analysts that I'm here to tell you again I don't believe this I don't believe this is the way\nThings have many can you know for individual voter to individual voter but when you're talking about blocks of voters\nIt just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of people back in December we're we're all intending to get rid of every Republican make could cause they have a Trump made a mistake voted for Trump knew it\nAnd then nine months later changed their minds but this is what they ask us to believe\nAnd that's why I Do this polling nine months out eight months out which doesn't mean anything other than a you know interesting talking points at the time so still watch to get to as the program an falls before you're very eyes and ears up back to the Caribbean story 'cause we're not quite through with this\n... the the the the thing that that argues again for this being a Democrat Party operation or an operation intended to benefit the Democrat Party the Associated Press\nHas changed headlines about the caravan after a bunch of liberals complained about an original headlined describing the illegal caravan as an\nArmy of migrants that is the original a pie story on this that in range and a bunch of leftists so the a P yesterday changed the headline after a backlash\nFrom liberals furious at them for describing a caravan of illegal immigrants heading toward the U.S as an army of migrants a rag getting\nGrowing army of migrants resumed march toward us read the original headline on the a P story a ragged growing army of migrants\n... changed the headline to replace the word army with caravan\nWell let's not a caravan either it's a mob it is an invading army might away not all of them are walking I mean you've seen the vehicles are on flatbed trucks there in pick up there are many of our whoever is paid for this is paying a pretty penny\n\nI've seen estimates of seven thousand dollars a person for this I seven thousand dollars a person's\nEyes I say I've seen estimates I've seen estimates is this is costing upwards of twenty million dollars\nAnd I don't know about that but I Know it's it's not cheap you have to feed\nSeven thousand people you have to provide fuel for those vehicles that are being used transport them now the cartels have that kind of money so to democratic donors have that kinda money some of them are walking a lot of them are walking\nAnd now there's a second caravan that has sprung up in ah in Honduras another a pie headline I'm Sorry to\nLos Angeles times stretching from ... seven thousand strong migrant caravan trucks through is\n... each in southern Mexico you know I often break out a map and I know\nMy geography I Know where things are in fact you know the what's fast Apple TV the Apple TV for cake in the latest software and they have these ... screening service a screen servers savers\nAnd they have added\nAs the most recent software update four cave video of the world from the international space station as it orbits\nAnd it's fun when they pop up and you can you can make them ... you have to wait for the screens server to automatically load it's fun to try to figure out where the international space station is what it is flying over because it doesn't just go east to west\nUh for ... I saw one recently flying over California north to south\nAnd you were gonna find straight down the coast of North Carolina of California into the bar hopping that saw and then in the Mexico and it it's fun just to figure\nOut at the Knight\nViews you can see Ireland and the u._k. you can see a North Korea is this dark as it can be but because it's not a standard map view it's fun to figure\nOut what's what\nAs as a space stations were two hundred miles high if these are fascinating for cable news I often Krakow to map\nWe're talking here about Costa Rica I'm Doris Guatemala El Salvador Panama not according to the map\nThat I cracked Costa Rica in Panama are much closer to Honduras than the u._s. is Costa Rica's only four hundred miles from Honduras Panama is five hundred Ninety miles away the United states is twenty five hundred miles from Honduras\n[noise] some people say it's two thousand miles from to goose ... to ah Tempe er Phoenix in Arizona but take your pick\nTwenty five hundred in two thousand miles versus four hundred miles or five hundred if you're a scraping\nAbsolute filth in harbour if you're a scraping poverty if you're a scraping holders from all you've got to do is get your neighbors and stop or maybe southern Mexico but they're not stopping anywhere they are heading right to the United states\nThey're blowing past Mexican police they're blowing past immigration officials\n\nIt's a microcosm of what's happening every day in this country this invasion of people end up becoming illegal immigrants\n[noise] there's a lot of money behind this water Marla remember this Trump said that in Guatemala and Honduras\nAnd El Salvador did not do their part in stopping this that we were going just severely cut off or reduce massive foreign aid that we give them Trump has tweeted\n... Honduras El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country in the coming illegal to be us we will now began cutting off or substantially reducing\nThe massive foreign aid routinely given to them when they grab a phone\nCall quickly this is Steven Gorman, California and that that that that uh [noise] after this I Want to go off the line to Steve great great to have you how you doing sir\nDoing good how are you sir\nFine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nIf I talk to your call screener and what I see is probably Democrat Party strategically because they had a problem twenty sixteen spandex came out and voted for Trump looking at one of them do [noise]\nI've seen some stories they aren't going to do at the time because the pocketbook issues and making good money taxes are lower jobs so if you park a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start buying a storage we're talking about where\nThe suffering there's no food there's this and that is that you're looking at people who are the candidate banger country man maybe extend nephews\nOr wall you go to the polls that week beforehand and look at it was darn worried about the ... level I think a very dealt them with their strong sense of family I daddy didn't you come back to the party even though they know in their own interest the vote Republican okay\nAll right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you would think that this is a Democratic Party operation because the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers Hispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever in their wildest dreams imagined it would be\nAnd in pre election polls the span of vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this\nAnd so if your rights than what they've done is put together this caravan\nOf Hispanics and Latinos hoping\nTo show how they are mistreated so that the Hispanics trending for Republicans will change their mind\nAnd not vote Republican because these people will not be allowed in\nWhere is it written and other putting glue the where is it written that every Hispanic thinks like every

rally\nThe venue Seventeen or Eighteen thousand people are lining up twenty four hours in advance of folks a little common sense or this is Texas and remember to drive by she told us the best ho park\nWas the answer to me in the early days rock rib conservative Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke\nHe's love to buy everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a court except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke gonna be the guy and it can take got Ted Cruz\nHas anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people who have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people to want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing\nLosing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies you know I'm not opposed to this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd if the Trump rally in

note\nThis is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie\nTo the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds\nOf rallies these ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife or in a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad cap asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such a a weight loss of loyalty and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\n... ... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into what Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures the media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand\nShow your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture\nSeven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's a number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think the Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have marched jumped through Mexico mad walk out committed they are those people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n[noise]\nOkay back to the phones we go to a floating in Macon Georgia great to have you with us on the E R B network I [noise] it's like for me on Russia appreciate you about Wilton it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spend a lotta years military are retired from the Marines although we're very good\nA lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm I'm One hundred percent for putting the military at all the war but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this\nThis is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're going to the to what you're sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough to okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you don't you and your like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nAnd we have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it's you know we ... we just have to follow up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the presidents would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think\nThe military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's the only news I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparations ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that maybe it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold a line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you'd see a lot of people fall in line at probably what Bush which or talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit that it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in an an and essentially stormed the bullet storm that go out and do you think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strike for more we just have to\nEven if there is a casualty or to the drive by is half of their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is to let them in\nNope nope after ... and like I say somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking this just\nYour own okay heroine right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought

in just to remind you Tom ...\nOn CNN Today the chairman of DNC no no no no we we always knew this election\nWas going to be close [noise] we always you if you know the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of you know rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and the irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the when an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes a bunch of an evil just talking about Florida as a collective you know that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective\nHe hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now it's all like anybody like this guy because of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing white gang busters and ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be and the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in so far this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor\nAnybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott's the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackles a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a\nJust a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIt and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have ah\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump has goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supportive because he's the last line to hold\nOff on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob\nSeven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old\nArgument over philosophy and it's this are you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democratic party believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or less have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish the Democratic party has become a party of groups of victims\nAnd these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish the successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of means spirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway I mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but what are these up\nThe digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...
