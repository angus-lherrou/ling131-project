fair hearing officer being correct and I'm going to explain that to you and why the difference in a minute\nAnd you know what folks you need to make sure that your trust is drafted properly in order to have it work\nHow do you know how to properly you don't you are a layperson but fortunately for you\nTo odds are expert here he went to law school and he's put his knowledge and writing for you he

your guy download our podcast and submit your questions for\nTodd [noise] so why is the difference again I'm going to try and keep it as non technical as I can well a couple of things one\nThe argument really is understanding the definition of a limited power of appointment mhm K which is what this is you are limited don't or to the ability to a point to a charity but\nThe definition itself is that a power of appointment is not a property interest so you don't own any thing\nNumber one and the definition says that you cannot exercise to power\nIn any way in which you would benefit directly from the exercise of the power mhm so even if they were to say you're going to put it on some kind of a condition we're going to condition this distribution to the charity only if the charity uses it to pay for my care\nWell then you could not exercise that power to that charity right because it would benefit you and that would be a violation of the definition itself\nWhich is technically fraudulent right and in violation of your own power you breach in your own duty\nI thought there was a big case that came down with this earlier this year and that kind of put this issue to rest wasn't there something that\nWell there was a Supreme Court case that addressed it as a possibility to look at applying the any circumstances test it didn't rule on it\nIt said maybe mass health should consider this as an option didn't rule on it just ... they're hearing officers operating a cone of silence that themselves they tore something around things right and you know there's more that can be done here right so in this case\nYou also have the very definition the essence the Internal Revenue code that says\nWhat is a five oh one C. three charity\nThese or how you get the dust Sharon on your income tax return if you give it to a charity well when you read the definition of charity under five oh one C. three which is an Internal Revenue code section it says that you are absolutely not allowed to give to a charity\nIf you do give to a charity the essence of a charity means that the charity is prohibited from using that money to benefit the giver mhm or if it's a nursing home and you have private stock in the nursing home you can't benefit a private stock holder\nSays that right in the Internal Revenue code\nWell then you see there is really no direct path when you give it to a charity who's a nursing home to know whether or not they will use it for your care or even if they're permitted to use it for your care so how can you say it's a way in which you are accessing the principal\nGrasping at straws you you can't write ... you can't do that so and of course if I Do share duties do apply so even if the trustee is the one that has to issue the check if you tell the ... the don't or tells the trust issue to issue the check\nTo the charity knowing that there's been a condition applied to it that it's got to be used for your care one I don't think the nursing home can accept it and to\nThe trustee would reach us by do share duty if it then did that distribution remember a gift to a charity that benefits you is not a gift to a charity it's a gift to yourself right

products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\n\nRemember how to drive by the Democrats than the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was going to provoke much icons it couldn't possibly be good at it might mean the end of what ever Rangel or making what the North Korea and it might destroy existing good relations with the dry comes\nUp up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on wide range of products China\nBut try comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including you products\nTo eight for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the tri calm finance ministry yesterday\nThe track I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us this year amid rising tensions with some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and\nZ and a B and C in trade and if we started ab and see I think he's pretty much closing in on the seat\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the\nElimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs lost about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than the throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer\nThan maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that\nDeal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take an insurance now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that may cause we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important in how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he can run the rings around people\nIn this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as an ounce thing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned about none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us\n[noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in\nThe\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them\nTo do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody it's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country it's a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come in now and I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize\nWe really we really haven't it's you know you can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplish somehow people need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of a new definition of humility rather than having used as a teachable moment if something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for\nEverybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nOr don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget\nIt was ... Hussein oh who's that none of this could be done\nThe remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore\nEssentially we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore now\nJust the opposite could be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of unfair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject NAFTA never was I mean it was in command and a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject of cable news announcer going to do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tune in\nIt's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden to David people get its importance in terms of its in Portland says that election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject of World Trade don't doubt me\nAnd in that sense it's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear to be who he is

your calls in due course aim I've written to wait two to eight eight\nTo [noise] so the president continues to take questions in the rose garden from Dr by me I Would jump it but the things I Want to get to hear a and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying trickster Zen skunks that they are he is\nLinking the media to the Democrat Party which ah\nWe do with all the time I hear about uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct ... as he has just if Mr raided the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH\nAnd find out what he was Feinstein if you'll recall toward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it ... we are made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know our name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington Post\nShe called the Washington Post tip line in the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer\n'cause it's so unfair it's spotlight ... and it became\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the weight because of limited possession of low rider one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine ... for a new and seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her and she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but\nShe's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at ... she turns back to the camera we didn't make it this German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say always this how we're going to determine who leak something she turned her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your weakness letter and they told\nNor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you're coming as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it\nIt was strategic just like what happened on friday was the teaching strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript of a conference call\nThat have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing\nUnfortunately I Can't reproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't\nLegally habit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups in organizations are here and the strategies that they use\nAnd it makes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake that he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator incident where just happened that\nTo nearly in say an anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activists ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting and they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nIt was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was never ... there was a three point strategies a flight strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has a piece today at

G. W. A. T. A. G. H. D. Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise] [noise]\nOh my God oh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what does that tell you what ... what [noise]\nWhat what what's going on here we are\nSo many races that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada\nTennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all these close races which means we have the best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder how can wave in the Senate in the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican to win at all no that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to what took an effect if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks\nSo the panicked host Jim should I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red white and the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats you'll notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on that you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation map that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm an only get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya eastern very ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve\nPoint advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's what all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again it broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind\nYou of a motivational technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check prior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I I I Know of one time he gathered the players\nFor a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race you had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that's why you Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and that'll ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices tape resumes\nThat much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds half the final turned ballot checked stops the tape a horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape there\nIs no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you were doing and bad humor guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational\nTechnique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter\nFinish do your job\nSame thing here polls in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of ... out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final inning take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral production of last week\nIf the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine\nWent viral and Dr buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run with sound bites me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them\nThey run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Kevin on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were gonna lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will fire buddy up no the way\nYou can get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news at ... some of this from the hill dot com red state Democrats

politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them onto the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now

to\nDeal with this no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nAt six in ... in in many
