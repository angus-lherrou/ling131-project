I saw this story about car companies and we talked about you know companies kinda\nTeaming up General Motors and Honda a Honda buying into General Motors cruise automation system I didn't know Toyota and a diner we're doing a deal yeah the ... you have\nAll these strange partnerships that are developing amongst auto makers now just because they see so much value in getting to driverless cars and building a different model where they can really be kind of you know at at the center of the future as far as where things go with I mean by that right now if you take a look at how the miles built today\nCarmaker makes the cars cells do a dealer carmakers off the hook they ... they never do anything going forward there's no recording revenue for them they don't get it eats that that's just what it is they should make a lot of money where I think carmakers want to go is hey if we can get to self driving cars what do we need dealers for\nAny more see I thought the dealers would become the service Centers for the self driving cars\nWhat service if you if you have an electric self driving vehicle when I used to go to charging you got to change the tires you got to put one show washer follow it and why do you live in a middle man for that\nIf all you're doing this and hugging cars in you know like why why not why wouldn't you try to take a cut out the middleman and just handle it on your own wire wise Warren Buffett buying up all these dealerships don't know if he's got a different approach Warren Buffett digs when everyone else bags initially he's right so maybe\nHe's on something there I just think the or if they give you it's going to be interesting to look back at the automobile sector Twenty years from now you know we can argue as to whether or not a ton of his cars are going to be here in five years or three years or ten years right but I think as many people that are disputing that Twenty years from today\nI'll be ... I I I won't ... no I mean you will do\nThey think about what's changed in the last you know Twenty years ago Nineteen Ninety eight yeah we're still not at ground zero of the Internet but we were you know when the first inning of understanding what the Internet could be thinking about the change that happened we had denial of AOL yeah you'd have that\nYou know like all the the it was in you try to make a phone call and you kick your son off the Internet and then you ... you wouldn't be good like it was it was ... you\nLive oh yeah I Try to hide her up to more calls from my parents are there any like they hated it it was awful but think about how much has changed in in that twenty year period with the Internet right what we're going to see from changes in transportation\nI don't know if it's going to be quite the same just 'cause you know the Internet is probably the most powerful invention you know in the last hundred and fifty years maybe two hundred\nBut it's it's this is going to be the biggest change in transportation since the invention of the airplane yeah I'll go that far on\nIt well it'll be a it'll be fun to watch\nA delayed Obama era rule on student relief is to take effect a long delayed federal intended to protect student loan borrowers\nWho were defrauded by their schools went into effect yesterday after a federal judge rejected an industry challenge and the education department ended efforts to stall any longer so what we're talking about here\nAre those crappy colleges that lied to kids to get him to come in and go to secretarial school er SBA see school and really there was it was a lousy education and there were no job\nProspects no they they may they literally made numbers up as far as oh Ninety percent of our people are employed at ... and it just wasn't accurate so there are more than a hundred thousand borrowers most of them went to these for profit schools like ITT or Corinthian Colleges that have gone out of business since then\nUh and so this provides relief to those borrowers who want to be taken out those loans based on fraudulent information that was given to them\nYeah it's a lot of people over ... hundred thousand people out on that when those loans are forgiven right yeah they're going to be able to get a credit card they're going to be able to buy a car they might be able to actually buy a house exactly the\nCause of it when you look at student loan defaults a lot of people think it's you know the doctors and the lawyers that aren't paying their student loans they're paying their student loans the the ...\nI was shocked when I looked at the statistics the vast majority Chuck a student loans that are into fault are small dollar amounts like people just almost won six or seven grand yeah and they go into default on their student loans silly you screw up your wife for seven thousand bucks yeah it's\nIt tends to be the smaller ones and it's either in a lot of cases people who went to these for profit colleges or people who didn't complete their degrees at for two year colleges yeah\nBut it they they like I I don't understand what the psychology is you you you you go to school maybe you can't cut it you maybe you're just not smart enough to go to college or you're not going to be willing to work hard enough to go to college and you have a three thousand dollar student loan you say well I'm not paying that\nBut then you you you you can never buy a house ... your your credit rating is permanently a destroyed until you actually make that payment yet you're always going to be in the five hundred to put this in perspective that are going to be able to get a good job\nNo Nineteen percent of people attended or borrow money to go to these for profit schools thirty eight percent of defaults come from them while thirty eight percent of defaults come from the profits\nHave a doubt only down a hundred and eight points I say Ollie because by the end of the vast majority that decline

care because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one since\nObama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ...\nCame to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what your job or do you\nWatch story I said you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story or having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out\nThere saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible\nThere is no way that Jamal casualties watch could have recorded anything that happens women there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password for the consulate wife by network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there and watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together\nBut only if you have answered that why fi networks password into your\nWatch why five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how ... your a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he\nDied you blow it up now they have to come up with something else I said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's most of the day they say to show he was recorded the events of have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] neither headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yeah I'm a Democrat National Committee cheating and election ringing down to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right so see I got rid of Fox\nWillingly open our mid to late ... had done in Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in politics\nBill and I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nI don't scramble my eggs until mine chicken hatch\nShe said meaning\nThere's so much she left it could happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact of it\nYeah I Would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy and the history of our country and there's nothing we boarded where you go it's\nThat simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not going to stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than it into CNN media media whatever\nGuys still Marge talking residents just didn't do much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop point loading the country\nAnd so they're so frustrated they can't stop it [noise]\nNow the latest headlines from the

Don\nMueller's wrap it up while I was I've been smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking it up\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this is what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on the educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influence the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\n\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWhen mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goal is to Rosenstein\nWho is technically is bars at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nAre out there for for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven\nAnyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people are happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically ever overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only myself people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart board\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn your preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember\nIt I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shocks you write\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national oppressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't read it short audio ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWell I think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you is the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up what am I ever seen anything my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nSo we take a break for that has to have a lot to say you\nShould probably be met work\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance rosy were larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information them\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger my policy did you know you can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life

he's not giving cover to the king and the crown prince other although I just want to find out what's happening in Turkey reportedly has recorded evidence we've asked for it if it exists expect safe full report from the secretary of state to his on his way back to Washington\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nNot about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern\nYou're um generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them very seriously\nDon't do tabloid anything [laughter] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins is the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest if he is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful\nPeople rich people there obviously have to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nMistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just\nIt's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about\nIt I I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen honest this is one of\nThe the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life to him\nEverybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\nAnd the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures and the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect it's the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody is decent nobody is white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor now I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to another than the entertained by it it just starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThat competing editor of the clean paper above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls the guy to beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the news ... whereas the female editor didn't have\nThe guts to run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's bad\nHit everybody everybody as a rubber made including the people at the papers\nThe reporters uh I I have to admit I was a [noise]\nAnd here's forty seven homicide a woman fatally shot him was living in the car in Dorchester Monday Night near Charles and didn't streets around nine thirty PM the eighth\nDeadly shooting in ten days children play soldier and for busing university lifted after being issued yesterday afternoon\nWhile a policeman hunger was underway police have yet to make an arrest but in Arizona gun connected to the investigations been recovered beleaguered mayor of Fall River says he won't resign James Oh Korea accused of using business investment for personal purchases and the fun is political campaign W.

J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales of justice arm line the department of justice does nothing including\nIndictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases do they had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on it their careers dependent on it and she was the Democratic nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again ... the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in Mahler report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leave that Mueller is about finished\nSince they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally ...\n... ... ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be\nBefore somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is\nHow long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian ... Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know Sean affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not\nWhat about you play the game let's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler\nIt's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[noise] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing\nThat indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does\nThat's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to get one T a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nDouble crossing\nPorn star is that they're calling a horse race\nAnd there are shutters and the drive by me the s U D D the\nOh my God presidents doesn't it you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called Helen guns of virtue on the left where want ten per

about a dual ... a porn star double crossing\nBack stabbing\nWoman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call in name she is a woman who attempted to run them\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act\nLike people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on\nPeople talk this way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom\nYour Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people\nI mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term horse\nFace when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as though take your pick ticket that take your pick any left wing or on media griping about\nTrump's using the word Horst base and ask yourself if that media reporter ... talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters Mike Shanahan that there's so much good going on here focused on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut you do there are also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder of the uh of the journalist was in the Saudi conflict is some bull\nA dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that

currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more ... low numbers\nAre almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after\nThe failed

Washington Post journalist Jim off your show me [noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern\nFor our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed as something happened since this program but has it been confirmed that that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so much they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while they did all of this and of course\nUntil I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings ... knew what was in store for a method\nFor NATO's apple watch the recording this stuff and the somehow is I found that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... that just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do but\n\nAll of this concern\nAnd remember Hillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in ... with no\nAssistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see\nA a disparity here in proportion now of course\nWe all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for his CNN all afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's\nIt's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is to people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Ford and solemn had two ... two doors did you do that\nDr balls before and had two doors that something to do with

going back and they have their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than needing it for claustrophobia and the the as the like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years\nWell anyway everybody has a home with a front door and the lockout um most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe in the side now how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was it was fairly expensive and then simply safe home security came along offering a solution\nTo protect all of your doors and windows and the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I started wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system send signals when doors and windows are open\nAnd if you are armed or simply safe system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail
