happiness victim ... it has just started the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of

Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated the house races or over their poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they most won the Senate\nThey have the

Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as your mark a shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it and it has to do\nIn many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi\nI don't know if he is related to add ... not common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then the show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a\nLifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth which was made to look like a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach\nSo whether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find out just habit ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed been talking about is the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and\nOil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nIn the United states he spent a lot of time and so he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys met a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky but he represents\nIf he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\n\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without mail at company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last night it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do the corruption and connections and storms he made a lot of enemies\nWell Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm not even\nRunning stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and\nPower away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont despite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run\nAnd criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example\n... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the him supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi\nRoyal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nYeah so so not only do we have a female passengers traveling with an emotional supports\nQuarterly\nYou know frontier airlines

voter\nWell I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters democratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... eight Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise] I don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I so\nI was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is this the only game plan they have and they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe\nThat the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to claim there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same ... and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation if they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let ... when there are pros\nThe right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats\nLying yep threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is that we don't show up\nThat's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not show up that's the only way they win but Republicans of conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engagement you saw I was\nI was

[noise]\nAnd the way you have seen that millennia Trump set for an interview with ABC not an accident folks\nShe and her husband and the president are teaming up [noise]\nThey have an objective\nAnd I will explain it when we get back\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG and double duty ADHD Worcester and I hardly radio station [noise]\nTwo cents on Wall street separating fact he is he's been critical of the central bank before President Trump is criticizing the fat again as too aggressive after yesterday's sell off planes mainly on rising interest\nHis administration who he does not like that going remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it [noise] [noise] during a live phone interview a Thursday morning with facts and friends are president said it was more true in the past when\nHe was first setting himself up in Washington he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people he doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... there's just not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance\nSo ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it\nWe'll get to and I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I used to talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by as we had it under the great control I don't think really\nThe grocery hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so\nThe next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nThe better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's where you have to discuss things safe and for him to make you a very dangerous ... older\nWhat has held in contempt by Congress colder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case\nA holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to talk to like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans at Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge or or they would say something\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much ... totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely you know you don't like to condemn it\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it flies in the face\nOf the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe it looking our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that\nThis great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter]\nI'm paying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worry and maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this\nI've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so threatening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump run the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election was why things down so they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nAnd your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nAnd we have great people right now are more kids\nAre there are some that I Am a not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nThere have been some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not links that made up by the newspapers the media is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand now even the letter written to the times\nThat there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWas the first thing maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that piece that memo that supposedly memo written by an angry staffer in the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal as the president doesn't know what are you\nNow the latest headlines\nFrom the double duty AG newsroom\nRuns WG a gene is run

sixteen election results\nIs this not hilarious looking back let's let's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not going to sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes we've counted the votes\nThey want it I think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for the Trump\nOne human knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide than they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people going to play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nI Believe is saying that this is an unwritten so then Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had cause to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate with Clinton and October the Nineteen seventies opponents should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating we election results\nSo this is not funny looking back there hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead and certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and condo leaves him\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and cause delays or rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have been resolved as well as the conclusions rich by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're gonna use it if Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was\nThat was going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump in one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they
