ideas\nWell sometimes I hit it out of the ballpark and other times I put it right in the trash cans [laughter]\nI Am not afraid to admit that there are there are few misses in there so now\nI don't

cranberry ... ... ... is a favorite of yours and to us that's a year round cheeses not just to fall cheese but to me\nI Would prefer to have it this time of year\nWell because it's it's so creamy and it's yummy and it's just as hard labor ... yes I mean it just it I Love cheese um who doesn't well you know I'm not a fan of milk I have to say um and it's just because the smell of raw milk kind of

that you\nCan get introduced to especially at your store because one of one of the things I Know I'm going off on a tangent here but one of those things I enjoy about your cheese island is you have little play cards that X lane where the cheeses from what it is and and the texture of it I I think that's fantastic and\nWe try to add hearings if we know you know tried this with this kind of beer or this kind of wind um I'm going to take it right back to Vermont right now we have started working with lazy lady farm in Vermont and if and she's been around since the eighties I Want to say and

lovely cheeses so again pair of Vermont cheese with a Vermont preserve\nAnd Vermont cracker and then you with us and they seemed gift basket for someone um but yeah always something new to see on she's island\nOh absolutely and I love going there because I've been introduced to so many different things in your store just based on cheese island I mean you guys come up with some incredible recipes and I was like with your own ... you have all those different\nYeah oh that's another fall or hot or not ... why we actually I think this year did it throughout the entire year because the demand is just so we can't stop people get angry when we stop\nWell people find products that they love and they stick with them so whoever created that recipe was that your brother I think it was our chef oh very nice ...\nHe's the man behind most of our brand new incredible\nProducts yeah well you know social times have changed and people are not having the same seven meals every single week you

you've made my life so much easier well thank you chef neck yet again for making 'em households run smoother and making people happier\nAnd introducing kids nothing makes me happier than seeing meeting someone says my kids love your food because I think back to childhood so many kids were so picky just right it was either rack and she that's all they would have\nUnless you use your will marry him and you had a ... foot back then nobody knew what that was exactly everyone was embarrassed right wow your culture and that actually\nYeah now people are branching out and enjoying good food and sharing it with their children and that makes me\nThrilled to see you know one thing I Do want to point out about at high doses you have a wide variety of gluten free products so um I think that's key to let our listeners know that you can find things at Hyde or is that you cannot find anywhere else yeah\nWe've always been um the place to go for hard to find a unique things so [noise]\nYou know twenty five years ago we might have been the only place where you could buy if somebody in your family had an allergy you know people would come in and buy tapioca starch and\nAll these gluten free flower type things um debate quest for their kids at home or for themselves because back then nobody knew anything about that right but they could find it at ...\n... and we hope to always continue to be the place to help you with those things well that's awesome\nYou know marry him thank you so much for coming in and and doing the show I'm the very first show a W T H ... I Know well we've always had a good repertoire when you when you were in with the restaurant show we had um [noise]\nIt's just it's just easy to talk to and then it just it just works so I'm very happy that you are on board with this and are in the in the fledgling show\nI always say what's better talk about then food right right we can all agree on it and not let it go it's just food every line loves food\nYes [noise] so you're listening to WTO ... talking food with at ... Mediterranean marketplace my name is Jenny I'm the host and I've spent the last hour with Mary I'm ... from ... Mediterranean marketplace now they are located in Worcester up for weight\nThat is in St they're open six days a week Monday through friday and then on Saturday um\nOver a broad spectrum that represents almost the entire stock market for where most of the capitalization exist that's where most of the money in the market is doing so if they're well managed companies and they're growing let's say hypothetically by\nYou know their stock you know index twenty two percent last year how many of you listen to this radio\nSaw your stock portfolio grow by twenty two percent last year damn damn shoe for a lot of very reasons\nBut it's an indicator say listen I'm paying this advisor I'm paying the internal costs these mutual funds let alone a variable annuity on paying all these expenses and I didn't get anywhere near a twenty two percent\nAnd you're taking the same risk that's not a good sign\nNot a good time at all no and so then you have to ask yourself I have done better or worse than my benchmark and then adjust accordingly\nWell again if if you are doing half the volume half the growth of a benchmark but you're taking half the risk that's not a bad thing\nAm I getting through here I yeah I certainly if you're on the other hand you're taking a ... the same risk as the benchmark and you're getting half return\nWatch that an indication of\nIts ... dance again you're being left with no chair to sit down the middle of this little game you're paying way too much risk and getting a sufficient return so comparing tells you how you're doing it's like comparing with your next door neighbor\nUh you know the kids you went to school and the class reunion how you doing okay uh but when you're talking about money you're talking about risk and re net returned to you\nAnd and then we we can talk about this the risk adjusted return now that makes sense just on the surface but it it's a lot deeper than that then you know I mean because this way you can see your return after you know depending on the risk right\nYou're talking about the sharp ratio okay and that's basically you examine the performance of us went by adjusting it for the rest of the racial measures the excess return the premium per unit of deviation in an investment asset or a ... particular trading strategy typically is referred to as rest it's named after an economist named\nWilliam sharp a again\n[laughter] that that's a nice technical economic term [laughter]\nYes if you had all my radio show I called to kabuki dance yes okay because I honest to God you laugh but you're saying it is that dance\nYou're saying I'm going to take this very aggressive posture and I get this fantastic return I've seen as aggressive as just come in and every time they showed me their portfolio say listen you're taking a very aggressive posture your bait is way off the chart yeah you're getting a fraction of the return but you're taking a greater risk\nWhat do you think that's going to happen on the way down\nOh it's not going to be pretty and the consequences are going to be severe it means you're going back to work at Wal Mart has a greeter I don't mean to laugh but oh man that would be painful\nWell let's face it let's be practical at Seventy years old you're outside oh my God you took a killing in the market and you want to go back in your boss says\nOh you look awful old yeah exactly okay uh you know and\nThey're not going to say we're not going to hire you because you're old\nThey're just going to say well we have some kids will do the same job you hope\nFor half the price okay you're you're not going to get a in a ... a job career at Seventy four years old when you want to go back to work in need to go back to work so when I say Wal Mart greeter I'm trying to be sarcastic I understand you know it's just not a very good consequences that's for damn sure\nSo it's so it is important to know what your risk adjusted return is in your portfolio and that's something that you can help us with clearly\nWe want to give a definitive numerical formula and equate that to commonsense answers as saying\nAt your taking a fair amount of risk for the return you got yes you only made ten percent last year and a great you're in the stock market but you're only taking half the risk you're going to appreciate that\nCommon sense on the way down which is inevitably going to happen sooner or later I don't have a crystal ball no on the other hand when the opposite is true and you're taking more risk than involved in the U.S and pay the benchmark and you're getting one half results after expenses something is wrong [noise]\nAbsolutely and and so one more that than just one of those really important or how much exactly am I paying fees each year and is it worth it and that I think so many people don't fully understand what they're really paying in their portfolios\nIf you can tell me what all those eighty seven pages of your last prospectus were on one of the mutual funds that you you you got to report on a year you're smarter than I Am okay it's all bird in there somewhere it's got to be disclosed in fine print somewhere but the average investor has no clue\nA I had a woman in the office again today and took a look on a particular contract called a particular company got some informational recorded telephone line answer some very pointed questions\nAnd she found out she was paying forty two hundred dollars per year inexpensive on their contracts she never knew about she's had that contract for like five years ... an account that's not hers it's somebody else's life\nLewis whose retirement and she funding the numbers are [laughter] like I mean again so what we've done here Richard this is just go through some like you said some commonsense questions that most people don't ask me too and that's that's why we're here to kind of helped get that out there\nIt's your money you have the right to ask a question and get a religion
