pretty much\nGarnish oh for ... well for making are things we offer so\nOne of the things we offer was my dad's recipe for rice pilaf which we do this quarter sheet tray which is a good amount served maybe twenty people\nFor 'em and it's so tasty and that is definitely a crowd pleaser and that companies the lamb is that that would I say with anything if he's to me these are things my family always had her eye table\nFor any holiday so definitely would lamb for sure our traditional peel off but also you know I eat rice with everything why not what the turkey why not with um\nWith the pork roast or some of my other favorites are you know we offer some people do order are salads in large quantities especially this fall theme salary befall feral and things like that but even going back to previous episodes where you and I have spoken about\nUm easy to make fall side dishes like our rice plans like we've got a wild rice ... blend we've got a butter not ... it's all seasoned with some vegetables and spices in there and the same with the ... to me that could be it I mean you could cheat a little like you need to have how many sides do you think or standard for them\nAs well in my house there's I pretty much have aside a person so if there's twelve people I've twelve side yeah if there's ten people I have ten side\nYou know so much we can do right by it or not and was sweet potato there's ... you could just cook them and they're so darned delicious or like we were talking about earlier out a little maple syrup and you a little something I mean my husband likes to get super creative with potatoes and he won't let me just throwing a crock pot like its guides elaborate thing\nI'm stuffing depending on your ethnicity or family history like everyone's got a different one so we always had to in the higher house seat\nWe always had to at least now with Robin boyfriend he makes his men is sub ... oh yeah you've got hit it was the best is ed everyone left his and I'm a little jealous\nBut we did my mom always me traditional we call traditional Lebanese stuffing which is almost like a ... you've got your rice yeah and then ground beef or lamb and then pine nuts that have been on the coast it up yeah\nSo um that was always in the house yeah but then our dad always made a traditional or what he thought was a traditional American stuffing was like the bread and he always cut up apricots and dates and I want to see the peach naps or something like that and there\nUm and that it still ... and I hated it as a kid but then as I got older and I wish I learned to make it from him that might be one of those things that I'll never know how to do so and experiment I Know\nThat I just want to do a side note here when you're going to make something new for Thanksgiving don't make it on Thanksgiving oh yeah I Need to experiment beforehand exactly because nobody wants a crappy person sitting at the table because your side this shouldn't come out right right and that would be the right to me it would be in the trash\nAnd I'd be grabbing a or do you always run the risk of forgetting in the ... even if you're very well versed in something right yeah\nSo it with um the stuffing you know half my family likes just plain regular season stuffing now than the other half like celery onions and you know um so I over the years have adapted how I Do what I Do\nThat way I Do that way I put other things in it sometimes but one key ingredient for me as I make the bread\nThat I make this stuff in with get out I Do I Do oh you're really making the rest of us look bad um I just I like to be able to ... to control the ingredients and sometimes I make with honey sometimes and make it with sugar I've made it with a guy they get to control the salt bake it\nCut it up into cubes roasted so they get nice and toasty and then I continue making the stuffing from their their while you're incredible\nThere's a lot you can do with if you substitute things too I Will say that for anyone listening that has an allergy um my sister has lived her whole life since birth with a really serious dairy allergy and so growing up we never cooked a butter in our family it was always um olive oil\nBut what didn't exist in the grocery stores back then what almond milk soy milk all that stuff\nBut they work just as well my husband has done everything again I keep saying I have done nothing for Thanksgiving\nAnd I will say because I've been working my behind off at our store like up until Thanksgiving morning basically um but he is made every recipe for Thanksgiving last few years with\nEither soy milk on the milk one of those olive oil base butter so you can still make these great thing yeah both I recommend experimenting yeah I mean that ...

decide which broadcasts introducing the IRA radio broadcasts award for capital one\nMajor hot jazz wars where your vote will decide who went over twenty categories like cry comedy years for curiosity and more cast your vote and you're automatically qualified to join his inverse for the first ever I our radio podcast awards live from Los Angeles January Eighteen now and I are hard to wars dot com\nThese news radio five eighty Ninety four forty nine ... double duty AG Mendoza de da de da de ... and I urge radio station [noise] that is a Fox\nNews ... this developing story out of Pittsburgh this morning reports of an active shooter near the tree of life synagogue in that city squirrel hill neighborhood\nRight it sure seems that way but Social Security is still a major part of our retirement and something we have to count on 'em and to get the most out of it you have to know when the climate\nWell knowing when to claim it how to Clinton but under what portion of the retirement matrix is a very important like I said earlier here is your group we have internal specialist\nUm met Don out of our Worcester office who comes here quite often in Springfield and travels around the country lecturing on Social Security strategy is our internal expert so I'm somewhat knowledgeable but nowhere near a specialist does a mad is\nIs not only an investment advisor if I Do Sherry but he has a sub specialty is all our people do and this thing is Social Security\n... hours rely on a back up but again if you've got a divorce she\nKen she claimed launder her ex husband who is a big wage earner a rather you know collecting on hers and letters go into for eight percent and grow on her personal account till she's Seventy\nThat can work for a lot of divorces or or you know when you talk about a married couple a you know they they want to postpone and get that eight percent increase on the big Social Security check I just had a couple just leave a little while ago\nThe wife was a wage earner executive of mask mutual and uh she made a considerable amount of money and has a nice ... where you want that to ... percent and grow and grow and grow okay so how do you get the income coming in to talk about getting a spouse or Ken Ken a spouse\nYou know take one half of that amount of money at full retirement and use that as as casual to allow the other one to defer their larger Social Security check until they're Seventy so it was all kinds of different ways still to increase your lifetime total so scurry received and\nMore importantly you know if one person passes away you want that bigger ... to be as big as possible because you got to choose between a small check and the big check\nFor right well and obviously you're going to take the ... the public\nSector employees have an entirely different retirement program a nose down a lot of years ago studying the federal program again ... is our internal expert on public sector employees as well uh and uh you know\nThose those federal employees land up transferring to a very high metropolitan cost of living they strap on a pistol on the side of their hip as another ten percent right there et cetera et cetera you can crank the last three years and increase your retirement income is a federal employees very very significantly you can't do that so so scary that's for sure\nWell fraud I mean you end up being a jazz twelve it's got to be All right not bad not bad at all no so you mentioned that divorce benefits talk about that a little bit because I still think there's a lot of people that don't fully understand what that is and how beneficial that can be\nWell again there are some criteria is or if you've been married and can prove it to somebody for at least ten years\nOr you are still single\nAnd you know you take a look at going down the ... ministries we put a pack together for the people you walk in there to marriage certificate you walk in there with the divorce decree now and they will pull up your ex spouse is a Social Security account\nAnd say well listen at at sixty six uh the person who's Oscar account as acts\nA and one half of that is let's say a thousand bucks\n[noise] and uh your your Social Security short for whatever reason was to be more realistic to let's say today a ... his Social Security or her as the the spouses twenty five hundred dollars per month\nYou know you can get one half of that that's twelve fifty as long as it's you know greater than than your ... some criteria is but again the big benefit of claiming your spouse or even on divorce\nIs that allows your account to continue to grow your account is not touched a girl's eight percent every single year from sixty six run up to Seventy then you switch over back to yours and it's a much much bigger check nice\nAnd and again the are the only one of the other stipulations is is that ex spouse has to have already filed for Social Security\n[noise] yes uh that is a situation you can't control or you're not going to want to go in there and claim it uh any earlier okay because you're going to take a hit there\nSo there's a lot of ifs and dust to be dotted and teased to be crossed but just knowing you have that right and you do the calculations we can do and say yes it's a strategy you ought to pursue it you know you're going to be all put some money in your checkbook now and see your future income grow dramatically why not look at it\nAbsolutely so what about what about all I filed for Social Security oh crap I didn't mean to I Want to do it again is that possible\nYou're going to do over a as long as you make a quick decision and change your mind within the first year of collecting your Social Security\nSo the good news is yes you can change your mind do a retake and start over again the bad news is you've got to pay back the money they gave you within that year oh okay so that takes a lot of fun out of that particular situation is all for Ninety nine point nine percent of the human beings off there\nWhen they claim Social Security it's a done deal sure\nAnd again you know it's it's the whole thing of of Social Security and claiming strategy and the and the number of ways they can do it especially if you're if you're you know married um wow I mean that's it's a complicated complex process and and we need help about\nWhether you're married or have a a a spouse who was a major region are much over the years there's all kinds of different components so we bring a client in were able to take that data put it through some pretty sophisticated software come up with at least three different scenarios\nAnd uh they will show you when you should apply\nWho should apply with tuna married couple and how they should apply and what's the effect is based on your life expectancy which means we need to interview you and talk about your family your DNA uh your your life expectancy expectations and you know you're going to come up some very different scenarios

financial football three point O. and here to weigh in on that as America's wealth coaching best selling author ... ... what do you think\nWill save it's never too sooner too late to plan for retirement showing or financial planning and when we're talking about if you're listening right now and you're getting close to retirement if you're fifty to an older your and what I call the financial red zone and now it's time to assess your retirement strategies\nKeep in mind hope is not a strategy I Know when people play the lottery they're hoping right trying to find out how realistic your retirement plan is from a realistic expectations\nAnd it's very important to begin creating the income now that you need and retirement you some of your growth portfolio to set up a safe stable income producing foundation\nOf your portfolio you don't have a true retirement plan unless you have safe stable retirement income that will come for the rest of your life so most people have Social Security but not much else but they have a lump sum of the four one K. let's figure out how much of that four one K. you can put aside and devote to lifetime income you'll never have to worry about saved them more income to better the more streams of income to better\nThanks coach great insight as always [noise]\nAnd finally today stupid criminal comes to us from Topeka, Kansas this genius was

officers could chase him down they got a nine one one call reporting someone breaking into a car about six blocks away\nYou guessed it it was Jones trying to steal car number two he was arrested and the other car that was found around the corner Jones was out of jail for less than an hour that's it for now joined us again next time I'm Steve set off for the financial safari news network [noise]\nBoom will come back into financial safari consumer advocate Thomas let's come here with you in Studio alongside the coach America's wealth financial and income\nCoach coached Pete to root out he is a best selling author winner of many awards including XP's ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on in Studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man brought our now\nCoach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWagon again yesterday when I was a a pre teens and you gotta think like eleven twelve year old Thomas ah there was a band called ... and that was a very popular back in the day that there were these kids they all had long hair\nSo I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy I go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of ... cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment\nHow how long is your hair and it was about down on my shoulder and I've seen pictures would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that after the the episode [laughter] more time with him on a ... a dignity that right that's right\nYeah it's it's on again your terms so financial dignity though you know doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial dignity and we see so many people every single week that come in from the show we talk to them\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have to get to the retirement they want to have and unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't\nBut fortunately they're uh they're thinking about it so that we can get them on the right path we call it critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing who should I mean so it's features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as more of than anything else out there\nYeah I I Would imagine it's just not making the troop comparison not not nearly being educated\nSo we go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial for do share as we can go out across the world and find things that make sense to you know one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners\nIs these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment trust otherwise known as a rate OK hoarding called rats before to balance it out a real estate investment trust is when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission see that's why they pushed that\nAnd many times it comes right out of your return ooh okay or if you are right out of the money put in so let's say a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust and the person you're buying it from is not a true for do Sherry the hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you\nGuess where the other nine thousand Ghost Wars on ... I was\nTalking on the person sounded okay that is that makes sense knowing of ice that's immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing and that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met and it does it does I mean that's almost ... percent right there I went to\nHarris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax cuts that on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and\nWhat they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter] remember these to cut through the cans with it and then to cut through a tomato I remember the guy they take the ginsu knives out and they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream\nAnd to cut it off a heart attack and then they put the dripping part of that is left the big three fourths in your bag and it drifts over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd edit out of your money that you're trying to best why that's a really good it's nice they slice helped me slice out the money you put in some it goes in their pocket some of them do when your while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are ill equipped for the most part they are non traded really British you've heard the phrase non traded read heaven here that I have\nYeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but yeah\nAll right so non trade it means if you buy it you can't sell it\nRight or locked okay it's like when you buy silver and gold now but it's the silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from short for Los yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well why we buy back from you for night [laughter]\nI might as my commission they say so they may commissions both ways okay yeah so be very careful if someone is peddling\nA real estate investment trust ask them why\nAnd say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times of the fact that people know the where they want some real estate in their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow that's what I was", "show_name": "Help to Retire", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "27"}
