barrel yes ... and hide as Mediterranean marketplace you have the all of ... and I love that exactly so nifty that\nSomething we encourage a lot of people don't realize come in and ask us for a taste of all of a lot of I hear from a lot of people I don't like all of because how many of us grew up trying\nThe black California olive shunned the can and I never cared for though so growing up the ... thing because the daughter of it either here so he was a self proclaimed olive king of list or he I I kept saying I don't like all of that I think I was maybe\nCollege graduate when I finally gave all of a try and I grew up in a Lebanese household there were all of every family event had a hunk of cheese and olives all over a table you know\nUm we have maybe Fifteen plus different kinds of olives

and buttery cast Deltron oh all of that so there is a silly and all of\nTheir so tasty and they're not overpowering so a lot of people's kids are like oh these are kind of good and then the stronger the flavor every all those different now you know every all is not created equal its I we sell an oil cured shriveled olive from Morocco we sell my favorite\nIt's strong so I can have more than like two of these at a time but the ... that's a large purple all of its South American and it tastes like wine taste like it's been soaked in wine oh I'm so it's a really strong flavor but there it's still meaty and big you know it's not a ...\nI just I like the fact that you can go in and see them right there and you can just pick and choose what you want then it's not in a jar\nNo we're happy to scoop for ya ya just holler at one of our staff and asked for a sample and after some suggestions another one that I cannot uh I don't want a failed to mention is\nAre all of and pepper mix severe so not like a little spice which I Know you do it's a mixture of like a four of our green olives in the big barrel we've marinated it with\nHot red chilis pepper and Cheney's garlic and variety of herbs

candy you to keep going back for more\nSee that's my idea of a snack right there yeah um I like you know regular snack foods popcorn potato chips every once in a while but really I Would rather have

shaped refrigerator in the middle of our store where\nThe cheeses both local and imports are kept it on the other side of she's island when you walk around um you'll see a variety of salami is and

talking food with ed ... Mediterranean marketplace my name is Jenny I'm the host and marry him has kept me company today while we talk about at high to the Mediterranean marketplace they're located at faraway pleasant street in Worcester and they're open\nSix days a week closed on Sunday [noise]\nUm and we hope that you've enjoyed your time thank you I Hope everyone's enjoyed their time this has been wonderful good and it's always a pleasure having you here because you're just you're the person that just loves to talk food just me and the show goes by so fast I Can't even stand to Iowa other people like food as much as we do yes well\nWe hope that you enjoy your week uh we'll be back next week talking with and how does Mediterranean market place once again and I can't wait [noise] my name is Janine hosted WTO ... talking food with at ... Mediterranean marketplace everyone enjoy your week\nRadio five eighty and Ninety four forty nine of them double duty AG mendota UTA GHB forced her and I urge radio station\nWell a safe well that's right so I mean what we do we backed up so we have got we've got a couple of tools we use but you can look at it say what will the ... if we have a ten percent pull back what would this portfolio have done you know if that happens\nWhat if it was twenty what if we had another you know two thousand and eight what will happen what will it look like based on how your position right now and that gives people you know and I you know an ... an understanding of wow I this is the risk I'm taking and as long as everything continues to go up every one is fine\nBut what we want to look at is what happens if\nAnd when we would say when the market turns because it doesn't go up\nAll the time I mean it's been a long long bull market and that's great people have made a lot of money but when I'm In retirement I might not be able to weather big big losses especially if I'm starting to take money out of that port full rights\nSo I Want to look at what is you know so if I if I had half my portfolio that is safe and half that's at risk and the market goes down ten percent well my net worth only went down five percent not happy about that but it's better than ten percent\nAbsolutely so when we talk about the volatility in the market then we're looking you know fed raised interest rates again and that has a direct impact on bombs and yet of so that becomes a whole nother issue to talk to talk about bonds for a second and and the the investment of that they are\nYeah so bonds you know I'm so are are traditionally considered safer or less risky than stocks or equities right\nAnd in in you know they've kept interest rates down for a long period of time in bonds have performed relatively well however as they started to raise interest rates Steve what happens is when the interest rates rise the value of that bond\nDrops so you can actually off you can lose money and bonds are on paper I mean if you buy an individual bond and hold to maturity as long as there's not a\nBankruptcy a you know you're going to get your principal backdoor and we see more and more people have bond funds and they're not in those bond funds will go down in value as interest rates rise and they have we seen the the feds have been raising interest rates that looks like\nYou know knock on wood we'll we'll see what happens but the guidance is that they're going to continue to do so so\nYou know sometimes people come and say I I got I just put it in bonds well you know there are bond alternatives that will provide safety and not have interest rate risk that there are tools available that you can use as an alternative to bonds where you can get reasonable rates of return but not have the risk of interest rates 'cause who knows what's gonna happen\nSo and when you see people are ... are there sometimes they say well hey look at this if I don't ever want to invest in this because this is always bad or I only going to invest in this because this is always good uh India kind of have to sort of set among the right path or\nA lot of times I mean you know when people come in and they'll have preconceived notions on different types of investments sometimes they're correct sometimes they're not I mean the biggest one is is annuities people will come in and they'll they'll either love annuities or they don't hate annuities\nA there's a lot of chatter out there this where people either love that particular vehicle or they hate it we've taken it you know middle of the road approach on that they're a good types of annuities that will fit in someone's plant if\nThey want with that nobody will do\nIf they don't then it's not a good fit but it is not one size fits all I mean we were taken agnostic approach towards any financial to it really comes down to what the person's goal is what their risk tolerance is and do they really understand we have people come in all the time\nSteve and they have variable annuities and that they're very very confusing I mean the prospect right on those things like a phone book and no one no one reads it\nSo if it if I got to have you know a thousand pages to explain what it is I mean to me that's garbage and because people don't know right and I'm not saying that they're all bad not all variable annuities are bad\nBut they just don't know they they they might have on income rider where they have something you know I have a guaranteed five percent or market and they think it's the market and it's really not so it's really just an educational\nProcess uh with with all of this stuff the variable annuity people come in and in ... you know ... they don't know the fees that they're paying that the other thing yeah you know this cost involved in these things and it it is it's not the person's fault because\nUh you know they might have bought ten years ago and and they don't know what it is and what we tried to do is educate them and then if that particular to can work in their financial playing great and they as long as they understand what it is what's the risk what is the cost to use this particular tool okay now that can make an informed decision\nSure well one of the other things that we have to be concerned about an end you get you have to consider it is the the long term care thing and I I Know we don't like to talk about it but I mean that is a reality and it has to be part of our plant\nBut it does I mean you know ... which is a big insurance organization you know claims that Seventy percent of the people in this country will lead some form of chronic care that doesn't necessarily that doesn't mean Seventy percent of the people listening now going to end up in a nursing home because more and more what we see is people are trying to stay at their home\nHowever having ... you know home healthcare comment is expensive that but my nursing homes I mean we've got a client I Know someone whose wife has has Alzheimer's and that's the big one and and she's got round the clock care\nA twenty four seven it's twenty five thousand dollars a month a month you know oh my gosh wow you know so that the numbers and then you know those are the ones those big chronic ones like\nIt can just wipe out I mean everyone has a plan in this country to deal with this you're either going to go on in Massachusetts\nWhat they call ... right I Know I have no assets number two I have assets in something like that happens you will be separated from it if you don't do any pre pre planting war you have some form of insurance to ensure against that but there's problems with that Steve\nPeople come to our workshops and they come in from the radio and maybe they're sixty six sixty five and they might not be in the greatest uh amount of ... you know the greatest health\nIt's very expensive uh it if they can even qualify and so it's a real it's a real problem is what we try to do is make sure people are\nPositioned to position the best way to respond to a particularly negative event and\nThat involves not only the financial plan and different financial tools but also the legal side of it especially with married couples we want to have the legal state plan drawn up that will allow them to respond to a particular negative event if it happens and if it doesn't great yeah absolutely\nAnd again well here's the thing I mean so we've been kind of going over some things that we should avoid that that you know and the and the dress 'em but we need to take a break but we'll tell you what let's uh let's open up the phone lines let's hope to give us a call a set up the time to come on and maybe talk about some of these things and and put their own plan together\nRight so if you call us in the next Fifteen minutes we're going to do a custom designed for you an
