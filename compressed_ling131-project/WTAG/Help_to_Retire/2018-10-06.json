[noise]\nThe receiving was an advertisement by purity products these days is a way to buy the NBA product does not intend to desire most\nWe see it on the news every night many financial experts are agreeing that in the markets are over ...\n\n... the Supreme Court I'm Pam who sounds Fox News I Do believe that way well confirmed judge cabin on may our next U.S Supreme court and how that\nYeah I uh about six months ago I had an HVAC system go out and you know wow you're looking at a huge bill you know without an emergency fund what are you going to do [laughter] you know you can't do without it [laughter]\nYeah we have one of those they probably don't have one of those big snowman a heater in down in our cell and we have to have that repaired I mean not good to have it removed and so we're looking at\nYou know us a sizeable and that just came out of the blue so yeah I mean there's going to happen in it you know and you want to be able to respond to those saw how how do how do we\nPlan for the unexpected in our retirement is that I mean can we do that to be out beyond an emergency fund what else can we do to to be ready well\nSo you look at some of the other big risks and retirement you know what one of the biggest is failure to anticipate the need for a long term care\nOh yeah that doesn't mean that is necessary a nursing home I mean Seventy percent of the people in the country or to according to statistics are going to need some form of kid now that doesn't mean Seventy percent of the people in the country are going to go\nYou know in retirement are going to end up in a nursing home but those cost even to have someone come in for home health care it can be significant and those are things that you know that really can derail someone's retirement so you know we do this all the time see ... we talk about that that we have a plan in place just in case\nWe positioned just in case something like that\nAnd sometimes there are things that you can do both from a legal standpoint but also from a financial standpoint that can help with that situation if it if it comes up and that's a big one and we like to talk about it and if there's something that someone can do\nBy moving money here or there that's going to put them in a better position to react positively to a potential negative situation that we hope never happens ... exactly\nBut again it's good to know that that you're ready for it and that just goes to to me any way it goes to the importance of working with a planner um because it's not a do it yourself proposition you guys have been there done that and can help us you know whether the storm so to speak\nThat's true so you look at some other things like you know market risk and that is another one that we have to look at in retirement and and again we use that bucket strategy of having a bucket for of now money maybe a bucket of money for soon money and then a bucket of money for later money\nAnd if my goal is to spend in retirement and not worry about it those first two buckets of investments have to be relatively safe\nThe risk that we're going to take is on that later money because if I have a longer time frame in the market it's not timing the market it's time in the market\nIf I if I Want to be able to spend with confidence I might not want to have all my money you know in the market I mean it's been great for ten years but we want to plan for again we don't know when the corrections going to come but we we know historically it will come shore and you can plan for that\nYou just can't plan for exactly when that's going to happen that's the planning process and making sure again that I Am position if that were to happen I'm not going to my lifestyle is not going to be drastically impact\nWell and again you know if if something happens and suddenly you find yourself sort of forced into retirement maybe for my health standpoint or maybe just a layoff um that's when people tend to make bad financial decisions and that's where you come in to take the emotion out of it and look at that you know as with a second opinion than in and help us through that\nThat's exactly right it's it's the emotion I was doing a review with a with a woman the other day who is in that situation she got laid off that had some health issues and she's just nervous you know and so she came in and she was talking about potentially buying another home\nAnd I was just a second set of years to say hey why don't we would hold off on that right now given your situation and it was really just emotionally I tried to help her let her know that she's going to be okay and we position she's positioned herself\nFor bad things like this to happen and she she is going to be okay she's looking for another job but she was kind of forced into what I Would call early retirement by being laid off at our company and then on top of that you know had to have some surgeries so and those things all you know we're driving her to make\nOut what I Would say is emotional decisions on you know what we're portfolio and are investing strategy and all of that and we were able to kind of I don't want to say talk her off the ledge but just get knocked out of mind that you know this is what we ... we didn't plan for this specifically but we've put in\nA contingencies and flexibility in case things like this happen well\nI think you said it it's it's the peace of mind it's it's the ability to sleep well at night knowing that you're protected as you know if if life happens\nThat's exactly right you know and the other thing is insurance who want to make sure our insurances are all up to date you know whether that's life insurance homeowner's insurance in one of the other things\nThat people overlook is disability insurance or pay check paycheck insurance of what would happen if I no longer had a paycheck coming in and I wasn't at retirement age right you know do I have a plan in place to protect that income\nOr is that it you know or is that going to be really really a real strain on the family so you know all of that goes into it well\nAnd again you know the the whole thing about being organized and and and especially when it comes to um you know I'm estate planning and and and the like the best health care directive I'll tell you what I found myself in the emergency room or a few months ago and and they asked if I if you know job of health care directive you're living will and I had to say no\nBut guess why does now\nIn the wake up call that you need sometimes but I mean that's so important to do that\nYeah we see but I mean every day people come and do you have those basic documents you know we just did a a workshop with an estate planning attorney and they go through all that that they should have the you know at least the will power of attorney and health care directive the basics most people don't have you know ... it's simple but do\nWrite up you know it is simple to do and and now yeah there is that peace of mind so if something happens you know you're going to be you know your wishes are going to be honored\nBut [laughter] but it's also civil not to do you know clearly it's not I think are that are out to nobody wants to talk about getting sick and I don't know by the end of the day or you know having those right pieces of paper and then in in place can really help people if\nA bad situation absolutely well tell you well let's get so\nLet's skip folks some peace of mind given an opportunity to come on and and work on that plan map it all out and and begin to understand how to get to retirement\n... the next five calls you call in today we're going to create a one page financial review that indicate if you're in need of a full blown
