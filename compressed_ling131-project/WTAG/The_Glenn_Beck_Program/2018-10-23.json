with another flag to cross a border I Would say would probably have to be if you were in the military crossing into Iraq from Kuwait\nNow\nDo you remember the reason why we had to wait to go into a right you just don't land in go\nBecause you need to logistics and the logistics of moving a crowd that size is a nightmare otherwise becomes a death march\nBecause people are going to get tired they're going to fall they're going to be dehydrated you don't stop at a seven eleven with Seventy five hundred people to get some water\nWhere's just the water coming from\nWhere where is the emergency aid for those who are falling ill along the way ... where are they going\nTo the bathroom have you ever gone to a McDonalds is you're traveling across the country and a tour bus has just

are you stopping for food nobody's controlling logistics wow\nMedia this is truly spontaneous\nAnd on miracle I'm expecting God depart the borders for them because God surely must be involved to keep

wow what does the president do I\nYou know ... ... the only thing you can do is send the military what what are you supposed said eight to cut it all oh yeah you have held on right now but it being right here if they get here the military is the only solution you\nLet them in no way it's Seventy five hundred people\nThat doesn't look good they they try to handle it\nOn the southern Mexico border yeah the ... the ... just rushed into yeah\nSo if I could do my CNN impersonation briefly so what you're asking for them to just start shooting and killing all the people [laughter] that's what that's what there is no riot riot police ah with tear gas and yes if you have to rubber bullets\nYes sometimes those hurt I Know they don't well the well the well and you know ...\nSome people might die some people might die don't come here yeah don't do it okay we have let's just say this we have Seventy five hundred people that want to release people out of our prisons\nAnd so they're just going to rush the gates Seventy five hundred people want to the officers do do they try to fight them off\nDoes the does the criminal justice system sending more troops and tried to fight those people from storming the gates and opening up our prisons well we wouldn't want that I mean some people could get hurt\nWhat do you what are we talking about\nWell if they're Seventy five hundred people and they want to go into a small town and Rob every single restaurant truck stop bank because they're Seventy five hundred of them and there's not enough police in these small towns where we just going to let them take all of the money\nOr do we say no this is a mob\nThis is a a group of Seventy five hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law\nAnd they've already done it and they're just crossing in an overwhelming we didn't we would never let anybody do that to any other thing why would we allow them into our country we wouldn't let them into our towns just to just to\nTake over our towns we would we would never allow this to happen can you imagine I mean you seem just the waste and the garbage\nLeft behind you know it's amazing they are just crashing everything along the way what\nAre we supposed to put up with that too you just come into our town and just trash it and then we have to clean up the mess after you\nAnd the question not being asked enough is [noise] why are there are so many young men not an older age ... already for your\nOwn or no no no no those are just women young women and children that are ... forced\nTo look like in like ... year old men yeah yeah who should be defending their own country yeah who should be making their neighborhoods better who should be fighting for their own country\nHave you noticed how have you noticed how the media is just calling these guys migrants yeah and knocked Marxist protestors because that's what this is this is a Marxist protest their their Marxist government which was in bed with the Castros in Cuba\nAnd manure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\nJust as ... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened\nThey get pissed off\nThey start coordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want\nPublicity they want this to be a world stage and so they started coming up towards America They're not looking for a job is they're not looking for a better life this started\nAs three thousand people who wanted to make a Marxist point too embarrassed their own country because they got rid of a Marxist dictator\nWe're just going to we're fine with that we're just fight with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nSo the media doesn't care about any of that and do the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want them here as voters\nAlready they're sending out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas set out but voter registration forms to illegals all over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the uh citizenship box pushed yet they check the S. and sent this out to\nNon residents all over the uh all over the state there's we have the governor is to increase their power base we have the governor of the state coming on and just a minute a we have Greg Abbott's coming out at about ten minutes\nOr we're going to talk a little bit about the uh the massive rally for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump uh yesterday in Houston it was\nUnbelievable and the massive turnout but this is in Harris County which is Houston Dallas County which has Dallas those are blue areas and it's a massive turnout massive turnout\nUh if the the red parts of the state don't actually turned out this state\nCould be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought or with the caravan of just learning from our friends to the south and what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here\nA candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kinda it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of them\nAnd we would if this was going to Canada and they were protesting Canada\nI think that would be a lot of people that say I just don't cause and you just let him go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just right just what was not our problem they just want to go to America just not a problem well\nIt is your problem and if max and give Canada would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero eight though like they give us any aid zero zero cheese whatever it is\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMine [laughter]\nHaving your hand Tom toms\nYou and how often do you remember the ...\n[noise]\n[noise] I Can't believe we have to have those announcements are but we we did um and the crowd was more than ...\nIf I was a Robert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name or ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um [noise]\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas\nMore than any other Senate candidate or for any quarter and history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's right on that link that's not including the ... money that is going into this state I mean outside a pack of money and tons of that\nUm so uh we're going to talk to the uh Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the care of and and also about what's happening\nUh here in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any contender he is really the greatest\nGovernor I have ever\nI've ever lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of a than a Greg Abbott um and\nObviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because it's a I mean it's a run away campaign for him\nBut the state of the state and the election when we come back then Governor Greg Abbott Mac\nGlenn Beck show right here on ... news radio double duty aging\nNow the latest headlines

hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going good\nIt's always good to talk to you I'm ... I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you\nThey wouldn't house that turn out the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating but because of the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote or for your listeners what we're saying with regard to the turnout is a smash them records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nOr the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will know it was part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure it was like people who are going to do something to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas it would be a clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election here because there are other people out there who are casting those who may be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nNeed to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said you know this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing I'm a election is it not\nWell he he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent under no label or they would call themselves a\nConservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were progressive\nAnd now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist ... and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a as an out and now he says he is a\nSocialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the left and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies that is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela\nIs over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a lynchpin here and uh the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped millions\nOf dollars into the state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand that there's a George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles a two years ago he gave a ... million dollars not directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you as bonded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that show but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this uh all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people uh who are Republican to be able to", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "23"}
