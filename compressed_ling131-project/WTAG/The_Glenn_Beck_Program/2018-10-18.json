be tomorrow morning at ...\nAll right let's go back to the how we started this week with the breaking news that Elizabeth Warren had a DNA test and then she had this media campaign where she produced is almost like this reality video to roll out Monday morning\nAnd it's just failed miserably but\nLike everything else when there's a failure I like I like to look for well what what can we learn from this you learn something important in it and it's what the folks of the Cherokee Nation of told us which is UPN a doesn't define you as a member of a tribe\nYou know there's a document\nThat's over a hundred years old that many of the Indian tribes in this country used to prove lineage I mean that'll draw blood from you they look and they do a genealogical study to find your connection to this document\nAnd this document at a list of all known 'em Indians living and and tribes it's not complete but it's one of the best ways to prove\nOkay I Do have\nNative blood native native heritage and while\nThose were the warnings sitting there over a fraction of a percent you know\nThese folks Cherokee Nation if you want to get educational grants and things like that you've got to show that you're twenty five percent a minimum of twenty five percent Cherokee tribe\nAnd you need to do it by getting this document doing this connection and DNA that try native of native ah by almost said Native Americans but made if people don't want to give up DNA they feel to be exploited by giving it up\nBut here's the thing about all of this\nOr we found out in this that just about everybody of European descent could have a portion\nOf DNA from indigenous people\n... and we found also that the average person of European descent living in this country likely has more than actually Elizabeth Warren\nIsn't that funny\nIf we're all Indian then none of us are Indian\nMy point is um ... you can't sit there and define it by DNA there's a lot more that gets into it culturally\nMore of your heritage ancestry Elizabeth Warren wasn't raised as a native person\nNot at all he's raised in the middle class family she likes to say on the jacket age or the ragged edge depending upon the day of the middle\nClass even if she was a hundred percent\nThe way she was raised would really\nNegate most of that for example there was a program in the United states way back when where they took\nNative people and and and and so many words they tried to Christian eyes the Savage is I mean they they took kids away from families off reservations that brought you into schools where they learn to speak English to dress like a mainstream American\nTo act like a mainstream American to completely lose their culture and then to become an American you know an American assimilated American\nSo those folks\nThat they have they probably have a the complete opposite in terms of native DNA is Elizabeth Warren but the majority of it when you're culturally they they weren't\nAnymore in Indian that a lot of other folks because it at all been taken from them at a very young age\nWhen I'm getting to here is why do we have boxes to check when you apply for a job anymore\nWhat why don't we just apply for the job\nChecking the boxes\nYes it was something started by the left\nWhy why do we have a look at the\nProblems that creates look at the separations that creates yeah I Know it's a little

them up into little pieces and put 'em in the suitcases and I think that's your clean up after yourself there that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards and it's interesting\nToo that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter right or ... ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or he's written it's relatively new yeah because he had left\nThere was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nPeople don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it for nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize without somebody\nTimes I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest a political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty you'd have to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a\nNew accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four minutes\nOur allies as Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point the author and wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school\nWhen he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the room remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who ... who was who's incompetent Brock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years\nOr ... or the me there was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth ah what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and by the way we\nMade a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking admission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but ... it was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite it's what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's\nGet this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's\nNot being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but the CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own stop something half of their ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIsn't the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still in that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia uh\nActually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into\nOh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars of course\nThere are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kind of I mean look at it it's not\nCompletely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do\nRight like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey right\nLike ... I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a column this is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up are working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and and the details around it are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but it being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and\nThere's a lot at stake here a lot at stake\nI mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and it's it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in oil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply while\nI think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your uh T's crossed in eyes dotted before you take any severe action I Would think\nNow look as a global market anyway yeah so if it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts to Asian we I think we've seen that happening too infrequently\nOr over the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hour zip recruiter or if you go to these job sites a lot of times you know it's great to be able to post ... or you know to a bunch of job sites and you know you can get a lot of candidates but you can also get overwhelmed with tons and tons of candidates that are not good candidates they had the wrong resumes day the wrong experience\nWas during school district won't allow unvaccinated students to come to school as a polio white disease is confirmed in twenty two states including Massachusetts district nursing director hope for the decision will encourage him and his Asian Eric Canada of Auburn raising an animal\nBrody charge after ... decomposing dog in his flooded basement that was tied to win support column with a two and a half foot long rope and prong color of\nWGN edgy as far as baseball Red Sox and he used in Boston can win the best of seven eight Elsie as with the wind the NHL ruins it Edmonton Thursday Night Football Denver at Arizona get the latest news twenty four seven at W.
