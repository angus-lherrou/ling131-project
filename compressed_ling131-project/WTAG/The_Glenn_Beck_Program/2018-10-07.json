your call already said that the seven witnesses testified\nOr gave 'em game answered questions by the FBI and um\nFor a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as former Georgetown Prep classmates said\nDevil's triangle was\nWas it some kind of sick twisted [noise]\nThey said it was a drinking game [noise] uh uh someone else\nCorroborated the ... at the Georgetown Prep referred to\nCan I say flatulence Steve\nI can say flatulence right\nUnfair you know the FCC as a whole thing about\nAnything exculpatory but what if the Supreme Court nominee I mean it's news\nI'm not being salacious within flatulence gas\nThat's what it is how about this have you ever heard of a pop up class or a pop up course the did you ever have a pop up course in college or Danny did you know never had man I've heard of a ... or\nThat was mom and pops you're talking about mom and pops where they are the problem is I don't know like like a ... like um like for instance Metallica had like a pop up store in the middle of New York city\nOh just popped up and sold a bunch of merchandise Amazon does that would be walking about no of\nCourse we're all of a sudden in the middle of the semester they say hey if you want to get one college credit you need to do this\nAnd uh and and they happen now I guess well I'm up in Portland Maine State University which is funded through tax dollars\nThe college offered a one credit course\nTo students willing to travel to Washington DC to protest US Senator Susan Collins as she ... her decision on U.S Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh he had to get on a bus Wednesday night\nAnd just go now\nFortunately\nThe president\nGlenn Cummings said the pop pop pop up course\nWas offered without the knowledge of the school's provost\nAnd that the school won't be offering credit or paying for a bus to of student protesters there was going to Washington um can I ask this question and that's why it's interesting a beneficial from the main Republican Party\nWants to know how it got to the point where it was going to be offered and until reporters started asking questions about it\nUm it was in the works in going to happen\nWho did it using a gentleman when do you think we'll get an answer to that question\nNot one that will ever be answered yeah do you need any more evidence to show that that\nColleges are places where they indoctrinate people like re education camps into a liberal mentality State University was going to pay for that I Would have a problem even with a private university paying for that because other than I'm\nVery few\nUniversities and colleges take federal tax money through grants and loans\nUh [noise] I'm Pam who sales Fox News Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice but some Democrats are hinting they'll continue to try to learn more about the sexual misconduct allegations against him\nNew evidence new evidence told the truth this is due process and we still get it wrong here's what Jake Tapper said about evidence other then he said he she said last night\nThe charges are upsetting\nA and and ah they're obviously they've triggered an entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are treated in this country\nAt the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence for any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one I for one we'll knocked condemn Ford\nAnd I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to blend that program so [noise]\nIn my book addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of of why we should really be talking about something entirely different why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true\nIn the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question is this worth saving nobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking\nThe question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both\nBut is it on the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing month [laughter] how're you doing\nI'm ... I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about what capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life\nIt's done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done ... work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we're so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean if you're going to have social media if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take off to prison and God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in most and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us when the leaves\nAnd and the their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system to pull people up to billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your head\nTo toe absolute so some Nineteen Seventy until today you know when when you and I were\nReally little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on so it's really in the seventies that people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children and it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been ever advocate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nBut front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not\nA news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it\nAs Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country that's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter]\nSo so competition is good competition politics and economics and in the competition of ideas the fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a friend democratic nation is very very important [noise] anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy fairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and said that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question that I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism\nHowever there is it throughout history\nSome people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have you know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating\nPeople through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you\nHow do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back [noise]\nClan stack\nWeekdays at five thirty Easter join us for a brand new program were fired\nAbout the Pentagon ever wonder why we choose the stories we using very high wanting or we want to live with that important for why he just got the thing that the mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day\nAnd the guy for yourself then yes and why it matters we right after\nHe wanted more so you've got the news and why it matters weekdays five thirty only in the blaze TV [noise]\nThe Glenn Beck show right here on westerners use radio double duty aging I'm\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty\nPercent and trading was about two thousand dollars are going to get to Laurie from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right\nThose basically system of wire deal so you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be\nPutting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward people that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle\nThe essence of the American experience the ... the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like scratching out potatoes\nSome ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [noise]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university so your four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise that can't wise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education system of their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college for people actually have a work ... where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things\nWe can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills in Portland issue without going to college\nAmazing or there but it's it's that early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens time since we've seen is amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies\nBack with more Arthur Brooks and is America we're saving ...\nGlen ... news radio five eighty and Ninety four

Brooks\nHe's the president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics there was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm however ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry because we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden as it\nGoes on and and by the way there are some people standing in for the ... the constitution guys like Glenn Beck you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good the big problem is that there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and on campuses\nOn the right and the left ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glenn unite we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically\nThat's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and people that we were just ready to have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people\nThat are making money and getting famous and getting powerful by trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about\nThe things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich by by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I said capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time they're waiting not to take that on is by trying to create a liberal tears\nThat's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive into say their belief system is stupid that will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people\nIs to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more quality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship goes lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives are sold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nYeah so I just do this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring and part is actually filmed in Denmark Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a it's a social democracy and has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government [noise]\nThe ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the one in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage we want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all would have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent you know your message has always been so good and fled because you don't hate anybody and we have to as leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you

with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me\nHow many minds did we change\nDid we change the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence so I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed\nIt's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them\nIt's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that you are you instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what\nAmazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish you do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who say\nYou know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least making some sense please do not rubbed their oh well we told you so well really remember when you don't do that please don't do that\nWill come them if\nYou're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if if the Republicans that cause it I don't know the kind of where I don't think it'll work okay\nMother scenario he is confirmed the house impeach is Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury [laughter] think that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt and they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate\nThese things are happening and there will there was no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump\nOK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if\nKavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while she says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to die in a sword for memory might remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he item leader I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next a nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the time and place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the\nPolls if if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd ... and ... was a terrible decision you then have\nRepublicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that's your best case scenario get ...\nOn come on [noise]\nNot giving Glen ... my duty aging\nNow

All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which ...\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial\nRapist Oh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or or or um uh\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nA by a woman or he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the cabinet case in the aisles the case\nOf the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she had a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violent okay oh okay that really got both of those so the little do you remember where they happen or you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor\n... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course like in their words\nCase they both have a note from there do they do around those cases you have the the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries\nHuh um and that kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is\nI'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being for chip and have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with them of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening but people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key those in a girlfriend has also are named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax\nWriting um pictures\nAnd are those are things that she showed two co workers in real time in\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... lives in I mean you\nI mean you don't have videotape well it was ...\nNow we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet\nOf course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the veil and right and we\nDon't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we have I mean like we have any him out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alison case\nDo however um what's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight is a split there so you assume that if you ask people\nThat sort of thing should be always\nViewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any thoughts on anything up all people who are accused\nAnd here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to ... and to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise] and how your life could be destroyed you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen\nThe issues to change\nAnd a physician's what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side ville destroy your life [noise]\nWhile

cannot do anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything

that\nIs America [noise]\nLessening going back program [noise] one of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and the the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yes I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people or you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company to make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy is not that they're taking all this information\nSlender using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how for instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and there's\nA lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein or have science a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton\nThey were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and he ... you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's a correct that real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about or thought\nAbout these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news this competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus\nWith us um you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council you give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil sands oil that's going to dominate the all market this is controlling the news flow in the United\nStates is in the end this is in the end Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first\nControls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it if we don't have them\n... contained in some way or another when they get to a a word toast\nYes yes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nConcerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and gee platform ing and the racing voices right because Google thinks that's you know that's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nGlen ... right here on western news radio WG a gene\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG

creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google that you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line\n... terrified beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice let's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform\nBecause I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and the size that Google ... wait a minute I mean it's it's the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com\nBut his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran uh did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use Gmail well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason that the ...\nYou're right you you are the product you know we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of a look there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you to ... story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center\nIs the main city of Beijing how many people that used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]\nThey had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the the system the picture of the guy and said find him", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "07"}
