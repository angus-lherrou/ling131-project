on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court safe for all the wonderful or the room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say what he does say is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger\nWhen he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I never met anyone reached further I Know if he would've come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't\nLike the anger I Want you to hear me clearly I did not have sexual relations with ... yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised\nHim for his forceful is you can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here is my ... to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have struck a stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings there's no way they would have said that cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey\nPoints for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot\nGive any ground with that

that yeah nobody in like a she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so they're they're not there's nothing new there there's nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that it by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump\nThe only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\n\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press\nConference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or if it went down all went down and dirty apron down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't\nHow long did they do take the due to the ... sessions of ah\nAh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February ... he was the vote went down so let it for weeks at three or four weeks for an hour we could have probably could have fast rate other things going on gay so you have four\nWeeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that ... the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's already been done he's the only out of there get done that quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another Senator Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nYes so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select him\nLet's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't strange accident but it could happen I did it happen in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy who they're fighting on the ... yeah I mean was turning on it that happens\nTo Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane they'll be delivering a the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution let anything and maybe we'll vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough
