A. G. W. H. Y. M. and mix Ninety three all three stations together\nAnd we don't take any credit for raising that money\nIt's it's you and it's the incredible stories that come out of the ... hospital for me both personally and professionally\nIt was a a labor of love\nBut on these days when there's so much news\nIt puts it in perspective\nBecause we went to days without doing any news oh sure John Still I mean the stories of the day you have to hear the news you get your traffic you get to whether there's are all things I mean that's like\nThat's like stopping and having a coffee it's one of the things you consume during the day what I mean is when we get into the details of everything that's going on and today was one of those days where we could have gone on and on and on but I Will say it's a wonderful experience every year\nTo go to ... hospital for children and if not for anything else\nTo realize how blessed we are and to realize that there are kids and their families out there\nOne who overcome insurmountable odds and two\nThere are people willing to help them\nThat puts all of the news everything else into perspective all of this you know in sports sometimes people will say hey look\nIt's only game\nTo kind of what happens to be when we do a day like that 'cause I live breathe any news and politics and opinion and everything else\nAndme for somebody like me\nOn a day like that it's only news\nTo sit and talk to a kid\nWho said for operations in the past week\nIs one of the most humbling experiences you will ever happen and I know there's parents listening right now who have been through that\n[laughter] to sit there and meet ...\nThey are the left\nAs I've said before the social justice wealth or ... warfare that is going on right now is inherently post modern\nTheir war is against you and anyone who stands up for our way of life not just the constitution but now the Senate the house the president and anything that is western\nI can assume that if you're listening to me now you're already going to vote in the next few weeks during the midterms but this is a big one the other thing you can do is stay informed and this hour I Want to remind you that you're not alone\n... when ... when you're lessening the Glenn Beck program ... when\nI started writing an essay last night um and I posted up on slate of Facebook but I I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you [noise]\nYou know the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse it's really not no it's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find that being said is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said look [noise]\nNot so long ago I spent ... years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed up\nOn us so it's not Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse\nI personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorce and everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned\nThat it took a dark chapter in my life that that taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it is\nThis going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you angry are you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you\nThrough\nEnlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we all learned the hard way\nLike I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility in DC in Hollywood Story today to tell you about Michael ... who's now quitting the music industry\nHe says he's tired of the celebrity nonsense\nEverybody on the left and the right we all have an ego problem we're utterly convinced that our site is absolutely right and if you violate that if you violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race to the party the cause whatever\nThey are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong there there is there is truth but I don't think any of us are really looking for at least a large section isn't looking for it\nWe are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us I personally think it's an ... problem all of us both\nSides all of us and maybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize what what is true even about our own lives\nBecause everything that we print in post most of it is ally one way or another subtle or bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we've been marketed to ever since we were born all of us you were born after Nineteen fifty you were marketed to your whole life\nEspecially now it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse you are not complete unless you wear consume you own your vacation at or you don't buy product a or B\nYou're not complete you're not good enough you're not complete you have to have this product but now we're being told that\nYou can't even be part of the great new society unless we believe and champion product politician or party a B or C opinions now our products as well that you must embrace and where somebody else's not yours\n\nAnd now we're in the final stages where we ourselves are products companies like Google and Facebook an Amazon and YouTube but\nWe're not a customer\nWe're now the commodity were the things they're selling oh you want this group of people that want to buy these things here they are\nThey if you can't fill in the line\nI Am blank if you can't fill that in with an actual word in be it complete happy satisfied excited or I Am worthless\nIf you don't fill it in yourself somebody ... somebody else will and marketers are trying to fill that in for you you buy this product and you can say I am cool or I Am in style I Am rich I Am smart to you by Democrat\nAnd you can say I am compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded and it doesn't even matter if you really are doesn't matter if you've ever given a dime or given any time to anything just by buying this label you are compassionate\nIt's the label that everybody needs\nNow if you want to buy Republican well then you get to be patriotic I unpatriotic I support our troops I support family values it doesn't matter if you're a horror in it every night if you're a guy there Republican label you\nCan say that by the Christian label and you can do whatever you want you just use religion to excuse you or others in their behavior\nBy the label progressive\nOh my gosh I Am science minded even though you deny basic biology\nLabels like courage I he has courage that has a price\nTag now but do by now because the price of courage is going lower and lower for a while for a while this\nThis was a time revered label you actually had to earn this but now it can be yours simply by saying things out loud in a room full of people who all agree with you and we'll cheering clap when you finally say what they're thinking\nThat's courage oh half such carnage\nLabels and words are experiencing a fire sale\nAnd it seems\nEverything must go now\n\nBut once that fire sale is over something else happens and what comes next forces people to earn their labels and that's the world we're about to enter\nAnd I actually think it's a blessing not occurs oh\nExplain when we come back\nAmerican financing there are benefits to refinancing your mortgage\nIf we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and
