please respect our men and women and blue we lost sixty two of them on this day in history [noise]\nTwenty eight of them were shot to death including metropolitan police department detective Joseph Elmer McCain [noise]\nKilled on this day in two thousand one [noise]\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um he says the same thing she thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ...\nSince ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some\nRaces where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know when there was a down by five in the polls nobody and winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote\nAgainst the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen but right now\nIt looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um\nIn watching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of ... oh yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I\nMean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance that this up two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... they're in an interesting group because they are not as\nPassionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nNow independence are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket robots typical I'm into doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left\nHas gone insane right and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being right her life was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand\nThe Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... I mean I Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nUh they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting Saturday here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked about among them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense nights in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for\nDemocrats [noise]\nIt ... I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened\nI mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that Saddam after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine for going into doesn't say\nI mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay\nThat has no bearing on who she was\nWe can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z\nAnd we can say ... did not deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die that that way however\nShe's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic\nState\nHe wants an Islamic state in

mean\nIslamic rule just by none other group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI Want to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy
