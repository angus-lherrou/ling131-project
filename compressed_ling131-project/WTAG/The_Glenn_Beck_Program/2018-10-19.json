I was offered the gig to do at halftime show and she turned it down in support of Colin Kaepernick\nI'm okay why don't you come out and do a beyond say thing like lemonade and and put on a big um you know Black Panthers kind of thing you could have done that right\nWhy would you turn it down have you had the opportunity to win to inject politics into my halftime show\n'em why ... I don't get it and that's why maybe I don't I don't completely believe this one I Do know that the NFL\nIs looking for entertainers appeal to a younger demo you know the days of having the who Tom Petty the Rolling Stones Tom Petty couldn't do it anymore\nBut those types of acts doing the halftime show are over they want to get a young you know someone who will appeal to a younger audience so that would be re ana um\nHis Taylor Swift on it yet\nI think I don't think so I think it's beneath her going on I wasn't that the shark who's ... sharks that year oh that was a that was jak Catherine Perry yeah it was ... at the same thing [laughter] yeah that's\nWhy I Know well known now the Taylor Swift is involved in politics I don't have any time for her she's trying to get people to come out for the midterms no sorry Taylor anyway that's our final word um look we'll probably be watching it anyway because the New England patriots will be part of the super bowl\nDid I say that that I ... says Danny and Steve said we wouldn't be in the world series [noise]\nAnd now we are [noise] maybe that's the trick [noise]\nI don't know if we take a moment to think about the men and women of his country rarely uniform wore the uniform or those who made the ultimate sacrifice and that uniform be nice to our men and women and blue wheel on sixty five of them on this day in history [noise] twenty were shot to death and we'll be back\nMonday morning but between now and then [noise]\nMake sure you take your medicine every day [noise]\nThe medicine and Julie Flynn would prescribe to herself and everyone else is the best medicine now they\nPay for your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he'd get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just\nYou're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's gotta be something\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be a you know things\nAre so vast so bad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot or she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like want\nTo say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant pond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like\nAlone [laughter] without your rather [laughter]\n[laughter] what do you stop and think about how you know pretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] ... outlook there are\nSituations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you'd probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there are certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations where like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to it's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of everyone has a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old\nThat this is a ... it's a different story\nA and you just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know 'cause the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like I mean for a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nIt feels like waiting does there just top like the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security\nThat they're there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico is does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course there's going to keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet or the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful uh were uncaring were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back\nThen they ... they send back them they then back if they do it without permissions they send back them but we can't\nUh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff\nImmigration law they've got to streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves economically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWay you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants\nHave there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights\nOr that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even do can interfere in their in internal politics\nPlus if they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics\nMay deport I mean that's a [noise]\nA blatantly racist right I mean like that it's not it's not an argument there\nWe would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter\nWho would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you wonder if people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it I mean right now that is what you want\nThe hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanting to flip the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe somewhere someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general\nTheme for the party I did hear at all talking about it in the debate and I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security that mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where a ... I think a great chance of winning or people to get because her opponent\nNow that can ... and I don't think it is I I think it's not a common nickname and some communities it probably is but it wasn't his can be and is it not cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture when I was that not a problem\nIf that if they think this is an example of it yes\nNow [laughter] I'm not going to sit here and tell you what the thing is I think it's a ridiculous thing but I'm sure that's how I Would\nTell us it's a thing yes [noise] yes he would [noise]\nAll right and in the meantime we'd love to hear from Roberts in El Paso or near Allentown ... scene El Paso argue Beto Glenn\n[noise] now the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nWG a June ... by my bed drink a vigil plan for Monday thirty\nFour years after western Jane Patricia gun yeah he was killed near one hundred Canterbury street at six thirty PM or killer is not yet been caught several decades later was the firefighter running for a state representative accused of violating state law in Massachusetts Democratic Party says Paul\nFull and shouldn't have worn his fire department gear and his campaign literature no one hit the Powerball jackpot but at least one wedding chicken has been sold in Massachusetts\nA visual save the stop and shop in east where him sold a million dollar winning ticket\nWG a gene sports baseball Dodgers that Milwaukee LA leads the N.
