{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "So that construction in um the spring I just talked to palm around or who left the city went to work for them um and they started construction the springtime to turn that into housing or the ... street are yours my answer off the list\nThere really is I mean you know there's the people particularly want that kind of downtown housing and some of these\nRetrofitted buildings there did different they're not like cookie cutter or they're going to have exposed brick you know unique characteristics and sometimes views that are performing arts when actually gets a pretty tall so you get some good views of city hall and and you and your station beyond [noise]\nUm [noise] they also purchase the shocks building and if you drive by you see the taking the facade off the shackles building and they're going to restore the old historic character of the buildings\nAre they burn working was legal aid who's on one floor maybe about spending not to a second floor and then returning the retail to the first level so and again we've done what we can we'll be doing the main street project but we did this summer's mechanic street so the other side of the building has all new street and sidewalk there we didn't know what you treat\n'em so\nWe're really trying to work hand in glove with developers saying hey you know you do what you can we'll do our public infrastructure improvements or the city council is going to get the new ... district the business improvement district\nOr they had sixty percent of the downtown uh landlords sign onto this they're going to impose an additional tax on themselves\nUm they're going to have a pool of money and they're going to do extra ... and the downtown area they want snow removal they want to do extra plant is going to have actually hire staff that you'll see out and about you know doing programming and the downtown area a lot of cities have this um it's a huge part of\nMaking sure that the ... district and it could be anywhere I think the canal district would be a great second ... district where people come together say we want a little bit more than the city can provide and will do it ourselves a pull our resources and really take six\nOf the time I ever saw that was in times square in New York yeah exactly I mean there are ... ... when I was there I should have the ... all the time a business and uh\nAnd finally the ... or New York should help with the stuff they got together for ... district together and have people out there sweeping all the way the up and keep it in and do an activity and all of a sudden there's there's people swarmed\nThis terrible dismal awful commission of downtown New York in which an active place you could go and you didn't have any say here's what I say I don't know or let's say a break is this commercial and then we'll wrap it up in\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area make over six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight when\n\nAt the fire will be the greatest ally [noise] in my backyard\nOr supplements she'll commission you have a say you want to tell everybody about\nYeah I'm doing that you want to repeat it or did degraded planning meetings for those that are interested in it and they should be it it's it's the future of your water and sewage bills but also\nHow would we were dealing with the environment in in our in our infrastructure that's again on November eighth at six thirty at the library we welcome you to come we do have on the city's website a clean what's your water page\nThat anyone can go look at and we have a survey there people want to take it and let us know their thoughts so uh we we welcome every once in put a little help to plan in the long run\nAnd right around ... starting to fall off the phrase yeah you're in a\nJam it was truly this morning John I Know huh so you you will be I'm standing on leaves and ... and leaves it it's it's a good thing to remember ah the reason why we pick up leaves has actually as a ... thing it it keeps them out of the drains that keeps those leaves them getting into the books and streams and\nAdding to foster ... problems in in in other things so we'll be standing at the Shia on November six throw a fit that Monday just before the ... election we were going to stand on election ... and as usual is that downtown because there's still leaves left to fall\nDown time where they were you know the density of trees is small when was that there and then we'll work our way out [laughter] usually try to do the whole program in five weeks\nOr so we get it done hopefully not on paper before the first smell so we'll work six days a week for five weeks we'll have daily updates in the paper or social media or on the city's website you know where we are way there's no parking we certainly don't want to\nGive people tickets into cars so we want people on the time comes or\nYou know to ask questions give us a call we'll give you all the information we can [noise] uh we will be handing I'll remind flyers a election day and actually during the early voting was going to have a ... banning all flies to voters who [noise] you know go to the polls show just one way to get to people\nActually I'd have to worry about leaves anymore now that the U.S somebody to take care of it had a whole lot of what's out any more trainers race in one minute\nJust that uh you know as Paul said the dreaded words winter word to remind people will be doing some social media campaigns as well a sign up for alert worst or if you haven't done that that sort of forced to ask you for a way\nTo know when you know we're doing a leaf pick up in your neighborhood or changing you know the date because of ah some weather events and to know when we put it in the winter parking bans as we get closer to that sees its way to stay in touch and and make sure you got all the information\nIn a ... you're trying to give us we appreciate that was at a map mostly tonight and we'll be back tomorrow we'll do it all over yesterday while everybody and don't worry just be happy [noise]\nFood is a little song Iowa\nThan you might have one little thing is ...\n...\nCame through south Fox News artificial from around the world continue to doubt the narrative being told by Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalists democracy ... inside the Saudi constantly in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia's foreign minister is defending the kingdom\nOkay so wait wait wait wait already found the ... they explain explain explain how that works\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines and all that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors are always working uh you know even even when I listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's the see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the biased detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective and impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments that now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes which no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you know that is\nScary it is you um you lead us out in the\nIn the um creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then ah ... how they have ... you know\nThe ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or in a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior\nWorldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results that's not like a news story than just stays there for people to look at it's generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift\nMillions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nUh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these the effects that ... that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd there was a hundred years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what\nPeople were seeing while they were using a the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mentioned a in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's\nPretty extreme wow or sees leaks these leaks that\nWe've seen recently from Google a you know they're they're they count as you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know Irish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at\nMore than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nIn but I Am I in trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm ... [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good the good the good news I mean the the good news is that um\nThat Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now interesting\nLapse in New York Times\nThe times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on base share all of their emails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing\nYou know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google\nAnd I wrote a piece about that was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago it's good news is you don't do that\nYour guest let's end it there for ... [laughter] this is asking\nThat for a second it will come back with the bad news ...\nThe the I think he's in ten different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech

there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected\nA dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that's that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target ...\nSure targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were\nQuantifying and you know very precisely a but targeted messing effect is really scary ah this\nThis means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly to supporters of Hillary Clinton or exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional four hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course is ends at what\nTargeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something less competitive it's completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nCan I mean this is so dangerous um and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two

I mean unstable mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're you're absolutely right they have it literally unprecedented power or two\nIs shifts to people yes shift to unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power uh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their\nPercent and trading was about two thousand dollars going to get to worry from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but seek it was right\nIt hit twenty thousand dollars will now seek it saying bitcoin could be up ten times or more by the end of this year that means it could hit forty thousand dollars by Christmas I Am a skeptic\nBought you need to understand what bitcoin is what crypto currency is and what are the triggers because this is game changing technology and life changing investment\nEven if you put a hundred dollars in bitcoin but you have\nTo educate yourself first do that by getting my exclusive Glenn Beck crypto course from Chico right now it's smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven ... back that's eight seven seven P.

publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low\nUm review standards and so it didn't\nProve what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was really fun fun right hum that he misses don't exist but they called all of our problems\nAnyway right [laughter] the amount of that um but yeah so we\nLearned our lesson we we took the criticism we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nA couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to address\nIt a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest\nRanks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if if we had gone crash and burn\nComplete failure then um [noise] that would have\nWould have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and admitted that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project came out and to the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work\nProbably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell in the other day yeah\nUh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of\nBackground in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only\nFeedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars imbedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in protest but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spanned Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end or do we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves\nSo [laughter] so are as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers a and credible whether they got a little gold star for [noise]\nClaims that\nYou know that the ... ton of programs you can watch on demand\nHas a ... you can watch every episode uh for

dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could we know that as\nBeing [noise] dogs and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we've put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and lay out either [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nIs that the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building as a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that\nEqual with muscle and to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n[laughter] and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed that paper he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of all areas\nBecause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on

upper forties to stake mostly cloudy with a change of showers high fifties catch up our cats anytime I W T H ... by other\nMeans Glenn dot com and\nWe're talking to Dr James Lindsey author of life in light of death or he is a you can follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the the if not the mastermind behind a the\nA papers a of record that were were being written\nFor for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the ...\nThe leading journals a and a and critiques but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would um just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here it's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey did it says this is a star bank says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a\nInventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to\nBe in a very privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this\nSet of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence teams and they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step\nFrom what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university\nSystem would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo the all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some\nSome uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the fields topics\nCourses I guess is the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't something fringe of journal and education this was the gold entered tennis philosophy journal ...\nUh but the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can\nBecause all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic laugh as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuffed grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided a politically right now I was\nReally happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole ... about\nHow things were going where you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge that was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left or left liberal I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know or left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all star I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um we're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to productive politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is\nI think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences\nBut I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I Am I hate to say this to I'm Out of time it could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me you know when you spend an hour and a half uninterrupted a and just\nStart where we've just left off yeah oh I Love that it'd be great great James thank\nYou so much a for\nAll of your hard work and for your honesty\nUh it is greatly

and again these things can change with large developments obviously you know something like a you know a war or to break out these will change completely or you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the Senate\nAnd a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nWas kind of mean I mean look at the ... dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party free health care [noise]\nSingle payer and I'm Sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than anything\nUm but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorsed Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it\nSeems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what\nThey wanted was single payer and now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just\nWant to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college hey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything\nWell then ...\nWhat do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you\nLock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\n\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nI might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this\nIs an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports that for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that you know it'd be which it may not want that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ...\nAgain like it shouldn't be that way right should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural areas can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's some do farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my former friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's why the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the hit it right\nYou know it's actually it's it's it goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was senator\nI shouldn't care about that because they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the opposite and is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own the ... give you the argument for king right I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\n\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed or no you're\nNot using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented\nBut the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but\nThat's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ...\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ... can anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and then just can I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [laughter]\nI mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter]\nWhat what what laws\nDo you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him\nDown police nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they have a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and in the mirror ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we don't want to make it any worse he's trying\nTo make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right\nBut they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no\nWay to win it's a great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes that is that this is the job of being a mirror I get the job of being a leader you're supposed to\nI trust with my home in my family you
