I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation or torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch and when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it's finished recording it\nJust uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists\nIncludes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him and you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\n\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this may\nBe an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our\nAlly we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we are currently fighting\nA proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen um we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of war machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exists and this tape comes out we have all known\nThat Saudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out\nPeople of the world will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as stolen as Hitler as Mabhouh or as Kim Jong\n... uh in in uh\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of\nIf this tape exists and comes out it's a game\nChanger that could destabilize everything\nWill go back into the story in a second first let me tell your sponsors won eight hour one eight hundred flowers dot com the first roses of bottom have arrived now one eight hundred flowers dot com they're beautiful roses\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we didn't with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through an intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and come to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you ... your duct tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're knocked friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nWill
