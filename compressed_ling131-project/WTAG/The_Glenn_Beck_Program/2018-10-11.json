privilege a sexual harassment um\nYou know all of the piece the stuff the me too which had and\nThey say there were seven distinct clusters now in America progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberals politically disengaged moderates traditional conservatives and devoted conservatives\nNow according to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional or devoted conservatives twenty five percent\nWow wow that's really low\n\nWill only eight percent of Americans are progressive activists\nExcuse me\nTheir views are even more out of the mainstream and are less typical two thirds of Americans do not belong in either extreme ah ... extreme progressive as ... as progressive activists\nOr as traditional devoted conservatives the vast\nMajority is now considered something called the exhausted majority\nThe members of this two thirds of our society share a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints and uh have a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority this like political correctness among the general population eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it Seventy four percent ages twenty four to twenty nine and Seventy nine percent under the age of twenty four I think this is a problem\nThough woke are in the extreme minority in this country\nYouth not supporting political correctness and they're not supporting the race thing either whites\nAre ever so

Native Americans how they're supposed to feel when they don't feel that way in poll after poll after poll\nOne part of the standard narrative of the data partially affirmed is that African Americans are most likely to support political correctness but the difference between them and other groups is much smaller than generally supposed\nThree quarters of African Americans oppose political correctness three quarters this means there are only\nFour percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe the political correctness

the feminist activists that was on the subway and she was boring I think they said it was bleach a on all those who are man spreading and we're like look at this this is crazy\nWell we find out now that\nThat actually is Russian propaganda that never happened that was filmed by the Russians and put in to our system as a poison to get us to hate feminists more so you look at how the exactly what we did\n\nRuined take you to a story I saw was a joke I thought was a joke\nThe Russians gone how deeply are they into our into our consciousness what will\nThey actually do is at all about politics Stephen ... friend of the uh a program and a and quite honestly a\nAre probably the biggest Star Wars geek on the planet welcome to the program Steven how're you doing well Glenn good morning I'm tell me this is a joke\nIt's not a joke um there is a study out I'm from Morton bay at the University of Southern California that looks at the role that online bots particularly the Russian persuasion might have played in the discourse on social media surrounding the last Jetta now\nThat might wait wait wait wait wait yeah so you just kind of re by surrounding the last Jedi by [laughter] the last ... nice and low\nHanging target being a star wars movie what do people care about more than politics I Would say that it's probably the light side versus the dark side of the internal struggle and a\nGalaxy far far away you know you know you mentioned Glenn like they pray on\nThese very emotional and personal issues on social media it's not just about politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that can be about kneeling the national anthem that can be about something that a celebrity and sent an amplified in sort of turned\nUp to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... puppet accounts\nYou were talking about a moving target people who are deleting their house changing their information making new accounts staying active so that they can actually be tracks to end given location and if Morton ... researcher at USC could prove definitively that these are Russian agents than he should be working at the CIA\nBut he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors did engage in to speak in all caps what words do they use and then as their account there the next week when you look them up again\nThese are sort of things that you look for when you're talking about foreign\nInfluence on line and it might be Russians that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians are might be some Floridian with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they landed live at one time they plan to into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen accounts that could specifically be rushing length\nA hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from that are\nJumping on line when the last ... comes out and people are starting to debate about the movie and then they start throwing in the tweets about the feminine Nazi admiral admiral hold though and then they start throwing in tweets about how a masculinity is under assault because ... and was unable to leave the ship\nAnd then they started rolling in tweets about as jade W droid than the fact that there was a droid in the\n... remember those\nYeah and and so and but the important thing blame that that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did the did the Russian you know ... or troll on line plant the thought in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and you see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's also that discourse on line that
