five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG and double duty AG HD Worcester and I are ... radio station\nSo you got a plastic pipe you have an an acme style bomb none of them have gone off and you took the time\nTo print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath\nIt it's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get her done except none of your bombs get it done none they they've had\nZero chance of making it through security screening and Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go just dam road runner keeps going getting away\nMaybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does\nEvery person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening\nThese devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen Wylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one now\nI Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who saw screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon\nYesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote given what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in\nFact it's all wonder that it took this long it's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents low he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nThat I asked when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the laughs narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent\nTo the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happened\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old\nWere you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at that time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote\nFor those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on any saying everything is speculation and\nIf I Would say Ari ... versus ... wife Dwayne person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening and they'd\nSay oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts\nYou do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\nWell\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us that it it it he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of ... when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous and a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\n[laughter] [laughter] right [noise] um\nBut there's another ingredient they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to they have screening services whether it's the secret service\nPrivate security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would know what I was no chance just gets to\nThe coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication level it's supposed to catch him\nBecause he had vent or she by the way he or she had white uh sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and\nAnd residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional\nUh mail service which would definitely be\n... I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from [laughter]\nGet the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they did have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or stores service at their whole right they get all their mail you you have private security you don't get\nYour money don't like we never opened our mailbox I remember one time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nFire that started on their first floor porch and spread to all three stories of the building or twelve of buildings occupants made it out\nHome health company in Worcester will pay over two hundred Seventy two thousand in the settlement aids medical services has been investigated by the attorney general's office I'm allegations the company was short changing employees\nW Ga Ga sports MBAs Celtics at Oklahoma City NHL Berlin cells bill Adelphia Thursday Night Football Miami and Houston\nGet the latest news twenty four seven WG AJC dot com I might Patrick news radio five eighty and Ninety four ...
