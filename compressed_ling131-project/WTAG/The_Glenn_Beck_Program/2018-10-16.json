I'm going all full I\nI've just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out\nBoth teams but what's ... I don't want to hear how wild out already or from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe\nTo trial it does the I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to ...\nShow any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA study so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans\nTo test the DNA against we have to use\nPeople from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nA and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nSites like that not only just weren't they oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian somewhat DNA does is it shows a lineage of game shows it it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than\nA prominent friends disorder or [laughter] that's true it probably would show that uh but still it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back\nAnd um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that that would there be some serious incentives to do that\nOne obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother ... secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've\nLearned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white and now or denying her what she herself has identified as\nShe said she was white and now we're going to tell her she is not\nThat was what I was not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people trying to you know she's lying or let me just play\nLooking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself\nOkay so you know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my ... my grandfather actually took a horse\nA big a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet and he took him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else but and\nHe took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't app okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was\nThis guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept a jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know\nWhat this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares\nThat's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this is what it was but it was the was\nIt was not true how many advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls I was ...\nI almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you been on the air for how many are never never I've never you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it I get it or she is ... trying to play\nIdentity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's why I decided I can give you\nThat I got what it's about is I give you that you're not a huge story I mean ... you know we well you know what is a huge part of the story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as fraternity or to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation using a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nSo and there are so they're stop their hearts Clinton incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh saying it's white ... he's on TV with you know with the crazy crazy stunts every day\nBut you don't ... how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to\nHave to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate should not going to be able to moderate with those people how do you moderate how do you go over\nTo the side of anti pot and say hey I don't think anybody thing is wrong with that ... out your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean to shout the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean ... cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten by the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their abortion\nGlenn Beck my news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... news when
