I think we're at a place now and maybe I'm wrong in this but I feel like in the way they were handling society now it's all about getting something taking out of context and putting it on social media that caused outrage literally let's see what five second we quickly can get this is literally discussion was she was having with other ... others on a panel discussion\nAbout what isn't isn't okay for Halloween costumes and what the cost and police are pulling people take that off put on socially it looks like she's saying something totally different\nIt is true and and I'm not a big Megan Kelly fan and I agree with you\nThat was not the place to put her it would be like putting me on Access Hollywood tomorrow I Can't I Can't do it it's not my it's not my forte now before we go let me ask you this question how much of the sixty nine million do you think she walks out of there with [noise]\nI think there's going to be a good portion of it that she's going to walk away would I wouldn't be honestly supplies or she leaves with a full sixty nine million if she gets fifty million of it or anything less than that I Would think that they just aren't making a good deal and they know something else going on but I'd say someplace between fifty and sixty nine she'll be walking away with which\nCould bite or a little bit of time at home with the kids and kind of figure out what her next move is while everything else dies down\nYeah absolutely and Sunday she could end up back on Fox News again exactly exactly Michael always a pleasure to hear from you go socks Buddy Guy to have a great weekend thanks you do\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out again\nThis time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible fence capital\nThat has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen even if this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nNow for a relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where\nThey're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places the end when there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo this is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against\nThe president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance of Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen but\nRight now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf ... oh\nYeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying ah has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's a real\nA real it's really going to come to the independent power the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nNow independents are almost always going to be lower in a high interesting partisans because partisans engage more like generally I'm the type of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until ... when I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was at a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone in the same\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever write her life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I've been for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in Enron or\nThis one's could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nWhat which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about a month and a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense in ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats it's I mean\nThe only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you\nDid have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nMinors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September so some of those polls are for that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because\nTo Glenn Beck radio news

millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you

the people on the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking the average every person who votes they just know\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better\nI I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness because our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education I I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system\nI'm making hemp and the candidates legal I'd hang of it before it sure such started without many Haitian go with ... absolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all centralized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because\n... testing is unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and try and why you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do hear that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and he was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about the really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better finished\n[laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class central I'm the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators\nBecause here's the problem with getting really sounded like testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion back into the world however we could still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows what writing granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that the the two counties across all ... to\n... the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average ministry makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we used to say I wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've got a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally not people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAt one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning there's just so that so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test they get a hospital plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is\nThe only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day ... that a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think cause you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctors don't teach them I talked to ...\nI'm a doctor who have not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory now it'll get you know I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT run away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be boarding school and they shouldn't be born school next you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace to become a plumber carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the U.S is doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn a work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife ... she's going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great preschools a pop up guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know that pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most\nGuaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to me this will pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid\nSo we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelve feathers is more than four billion dollars we saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach\nWe've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this lemon twelfth grade you're an eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo believe that isn't there the bully kids in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but now he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade this one problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught\nWith killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go to my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class\nI Can't go she didn't like the ... the the farm and he's been a fix a tractor\nThe end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we\nSolve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will\nDo that coming up in a just a

his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system ah you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond\nMe but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo\nIs pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts\nIf I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants insurance forest firearm\nNow they can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they mean insurance now when\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe acts\nCompliant say fact was passing twenty Thirteen and the fact that that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent selling it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops words that have been revamped it all because of that in other words but it now if you're a tire caught what you retire when you're a felon again\nBecause you know the fact that he caught\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this just horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy mhm constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired ... that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he descendent thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nWhen I did it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and his pension is now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pension so sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for
