a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser a Christina Ford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend she well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience\nShe's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Barack Obama is head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was per rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is on old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any is CNN's not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nHey she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting\nHave either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this\nCase not to the court not for prosecution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard\nAnd quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and\nLike she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with a left yes\nSo she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly\nWhat it was now she explains why she says Ford has significantly changed her story\nSeveral times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYear in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties\nLate teens why did it change and how did it change\nWithin the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it gets better this is the again I'm quoting\nI'm quoting the um the report it gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged attack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nWG a juniors room by Mike ... public schools are partially meeting targets according to ... scores
