W E a G ... Ga Ga HD Worcester and I are ... radio station Brett Kavanaugh's\nNow this is interesting because I Do remember while she was under oath eight votes\nIt's strange line of questioning that went a little something like\nThis have you ever had discussions with anyone ah besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph\nNever never and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that\nNow and then you know scared at the test itself she scared of the kind of struggle of that I can tell the information that has to address yeah whatever it's going to reveal okay I didn't expect it to the as long as it is going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nStress ... have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test never\nNever maybe the FBI I demand an FBI investigation on Monica el\nMcClain who is a lifetime friend of Dr Ford because there is no to use this word carefully than accuser we have to define that here in a second and the shoes are saying\nThat Dr Ford and Monica McLean\n\nMonaco was interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office I witnessed Dr Ford help McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs\nWork and help to McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nLet me play this audio again of what she said under oath\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone ... attorneys anyone how to take a polygraph never never and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that\nNow and it scared at ... air that comes from below that mhm I can see how the information that has to address yeah whatever was going to reveal or I didn't expect it to the as long as it's going to be so it's a little bit stressful okay\nHave you ever given chips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test anyone never never never\nWell we know somebody's lying here\nWe know we know someone is lying right do we still because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else about a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it any better she now that you moved accused she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standard that the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be a professor and be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant I think so how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this standard because this is the standard that's coming this is the standard that\nWe are now running to embrace this is the standard that our children this is the standard that we ran from this is why we're America because in every other country this was a new idea\nYou can always come into my house and just take me you can't just throw me in jail you have to have an accuser I have to know what the charges are I have a right to defend myself I have a right to know who my accuser is and address\nMy accuser\nI have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and this is what America was founded on is this is an a uniquely American idea\nThis was the genius of our founders you want to flush it away\nGo ahead [noise] but I Will not to be part of it this is the American idea\nNow listen\nIt is so imperative that you understand what this is if you do not understand what you're fighting do you think we could have won World War two\nWithout naming the Nazis [noise] do\nYou think we will ever win this war on terror with out naming what it is about what is driving people to the terror\nVeit is la ... ideas not Muslim ideas Islam is ideas that sure real law is the prevailing law and if you are not under surreal law you're an infidel which means I can kill you I can rape you I can turn you into a slave\nThat\nIs what the war on terror is all about\nAnd we will never win it unless we name our enemy\nWe would have never won World War two if we were fighting the Germans we we're not fighting the Germans we were fighting the Nazis\nWe would not have one in the in the civil war had we been fighting the south\nWe were fighting people who didn't believe in the constitution we were fighting for the freedom\nOf all men that's why we won and by the way if you don't think that's true we lost every single battle up until the point\nThat Abraham Lincoln said this is about slavery\nLook it up we wouldn't have won the the American Revolution\nIf it wasn't against tyranny it wasn't against the king it\nWas against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea that you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry which will play directly into what they want to happen\nThey want us at each other's throats they want us to be irrational they want us to be angry they want us to just to start swinging and blind rage\nThat's their plan\nAnd until you understand what they're doing until you will understand that this isn't really about Ford this isn't about the charges this isn't about anything\nThis is all about the patriarchy this is all about white men have put together in this case a rape culture and they have\nKept people down and it doesn't matter if he really did it because other white men have it doesn't matter if she was really a victim because other women have\nBeen victims this is about collective justice currently entitled social justice but make no mistake this is collective\nJustice and collective justice [noise]\nTo put it into the terms that are Christian will understand is anti Christ\nCollective salvation is anti Christ collective justice is anti Christ individual salvation individual justice\nThat is Christian\nYou cannot balance the scales bike convicting someone who is not guilty because someone who looks like them\nHas done it anyway\n\nI don't think America understands and I think you feel
