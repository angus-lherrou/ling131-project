G. wells famous Eighteen Ninety eight novel war of the world for the Martians invading\nAbout really what happened was it was an example of fake news media saying oh God here we go no it really was\nSeen there were there were some people it was a very small amount of people who really believed when they tuned into the broadcast and didn't hear the disclaimer at the beginning or the disclaimer that came later when the CBS Studios phone lines were ringing off the hook they thought it was real\nBut there was such a small number of people what became real was the ... rage\nAnd the outrage really came from a lot of different newspapers that wanted to sell a story the next day that people believe that a radio broadcast was a Martian invasions that maybe it was a little bit of a media attacking media scene newspapers didn't like the fact that radio stations were stealing advertising from them like we continue to do today\nWhat do you call a group of people two thousand four thousand seven thousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not while carrying another country's flag\nWhat what what do you call that\n[noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one\nThere will be an invasion because America can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is and I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand\nPeople all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\n\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nWould you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know what they're not common for you know here\nThey are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\n\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I sure be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act two examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures that's why we should have\nBorder policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows and the back door entries\nThe country needs either\nSerious policy on the border that will stop this\nOr you need to build the damn wall because quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution but I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and so far when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program [noise] direction by numbers\nA look at election by a numbers hello says do tell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get all the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category I'm pulling spend close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's where we have right now are done in only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's spilling Republican state\nA ... and a ... a Mississippi and North Dakota we're going to get you to fifty one if you if Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling has a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are\nUh in the top ... category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic state uh again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\n... movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat polling there [noise] you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tough race for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point er and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big culprit pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin I'll vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can stay pretty solidly that there's\nThat the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and you give us some of those results on the house\nTerms that lecture and by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr don't want to tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really truly a great service\nI I'm going to be honest with you I've ... I've I'm I'm I'm fifty three fifty four year old ban love of beat I've never gone and bought a filter to change the filter no matter I've owned house after has never changed it\nYou've never changed it in your life never\nI Would just be adjusted first time because the filter by young soldier by is just a way to it's a way to like skipped the responsibilities of being a man ... yeah the veil just do they just send it to you so you don't have to remember ... and I know with you you just had your wife do it\nNo I actually went well well well I mean it's there I was there okay well I ... I took the filter I took it from the front porch\nAnd I said honey where the hell are the ... where do we change the filters\nAnd she said I think it's up stairs and so she went to one direction I went the other direction some might say\nI knew it wasn't in that closet mhm um and ah interesting and so then she ... she found it and she pulled together went out and I'm like oh great well here's the new one and she put that ... you know ... does well so you were there I was there well\nYeah and I would say if anything it's that the road is a little bit more up hill than it was a week ago um you know it was interesting someone made a election analyst made this point and it's an interesting one probably the most calm and can under control that Donald Trump was in the entire election was in the last couple of weeks\nIf you remember he gave Hillary nothing nothing after that tape came out right that was probably a month before the election last three weeks he gave her nothing\nShe had nothing to say he was crazy on he was I mean as rock solid has he has been as under control as even know crazy tweet none of it he didn't play any of those games like a week for the election and that's when he closed the entire gap was down by\nEight in the polls are so ah when after the the tape came out and closed it to a much ... you know tighter margin and wound up winning obviously\nYou know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential uh executive order to hug and birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to the right to\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled Kevin you can you just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal\nYou know what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah\nI think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continued a dog pile and and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the\nPresses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it ... out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable I think\nWe have to also back up and say that this is not just as just the Trump election right off distance there lecturing for individuals and individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it\nI think the issue a overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or it's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you'd hoped to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the ... like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run\nFor Trump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know a month before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap all the way almost would pose\nA so it was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaning that will get out and vote do not want to sit this election out get out and vote Mm\nMore and more retirees are drawing on their savings every month to supplement their retirement if you're doing that you know the overwhelming

com [noise]\nEthical and that kind of an [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr path grey who ah preceded this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download at your leisure welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them\n[laughter] so you're okay with it yeah whatever [laughter]\nIt was not the justification yeah it is the justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally okay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday\nEverything after the tenth amendment basically is a ... it's just a ... or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to pay your debt right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees\nOkay and they get I'll stop it yeah here ... ... ... ... literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to ... this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous somewhat that was\n... and so it's what I meant interpreted now all this time right but you can't you can't you should do it with an executive no but\nIf he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with\nIt yeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it they will challenge it and I want\nI I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but\nI Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be internally there is yeah I seen it would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in\nWould now rule on this than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to be fascinating to edit does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and ah\nAnd Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really I mean\nYou can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and it'd be like say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it that just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's a pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision if if the Americans they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of important to have your guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about face for we're talking about his bad hair day there\nThat was done intentionally [noise] to send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much\nBut I'm I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nAnd just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from a ... a hard core conservative yeah shield our daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not I mean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Worcester", "day": "30"}
