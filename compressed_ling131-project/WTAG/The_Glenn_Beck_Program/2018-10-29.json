about it last night okay who's next we got\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap\nOf land and they say was there is because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud\nOf who they were they could finally live\n\nThe groups that saved him\nThe Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world it was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews\nBut people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia to try to stop this is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\n\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again\nThe group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing\nSurvive anti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease\nAnti Semitism is as old as the world\nFrom the moment God said I Will make you might people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism\nEvery time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI've told you you are the audience that will in the in ... the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence the world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\n\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate has to be gone again and it's not\nDonald Trump and it's not Iraq Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time\nAnd the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos\nIt always comes in a time of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society it's why\nOur founders came here in the first place\nIt's why our founders defended the Jews\n\n\nWe're a different country we're a different people we're\nNot better than the ...\nOf the world we just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first gray seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nDo something to earn a living I watch a live\n\nFDR said\nThis generation has a rendezvous with destiny\nI echo those words\n\nOur generation must be the generation that breaks the cycle there is no one else in the world who will do it\nWho will stand against this onslaught who will stand against their hatred in the nationalism and the and the the collective wisdom\nThe extermination of people that just aren't good enough we\nAre headed that way we are headed that way once you cannot talk to your neighbors once the other side has nothing to offer\nYou have to eliminate them because they're the devil they're the devil and you cannot deal with the devil\n\nWill this sixty to eighty percent of this country stand up\n\nThey never ever have like never ever\nI mean he was he was a you know a a a misfit his entire life I mean he's the he is the quintessential example of a guy who goes out and kills he's he's mad at society because he's never felt like he has fit in\nAnd look how the press just they do they made this into Donald Trump made this ended Donald Trump\nNow that one is at least you can draw a line from the idea that he is not that he would have to rally it's not ... you know ... or anything but I at least he was a Trump supporter\nThe the guy who did the shooting at the at the synagogue to try to do the same thing he outwardly hated Trump outwardly hated him\nHe posted on social media about how he was really just assisting the Jews or that he knew that people thought he talked to a good game but in reality he was helping Jews and I and we need to stop it he hated the guy and then they don't try to turn it into his\nWife a giants cartoon safe fell on Donald Trump today and he was removed from the earth mhm\nAll these problems would still exist this is not Donald Trump Donald Trump is a symptom there is a sickness in our society\nOur political system is nothing more than a reflection of us and people are alone they're tired they're afraid they don't want to be stuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming\nThem you know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're out here Boston\nTheir ass they're out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in a prison system called school that is\nTeaching and and doing everything that most parents believe they come home they're tired\nThey don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed\nSociety is just pouring into their house with with the media and social media and then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering a solution none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution\nIs just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed they're the ones\nThat are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones excuse me\nWere just out here in Boston are asked trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars\nI'm Sorry but the the what's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick Mm\nPillow unity here with a learned the patient to my neighbors who like to thank load recent changes to your bank ownership head you

you you're not having a hard time talking out then speaking true you know that would do the easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had a really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just did you guys watching the news all this week you\nKnow as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews ... or oh the N n my heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you don't want to lose I don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watching Shepard Smith uh [laughter] but it's always been that way but I don't know I'm just CNN I don't know who does 'cause that's his son watch all\nThe people who hate Trump ... yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on a sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly out\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of a bird dog will be better\nBut he'd be like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe's ... he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear\nThat this shooter or outwardly heated Donald Trump\nYeah we do not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or as long as you don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall\nOur discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault right [laughter]\nReally is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican and was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say\nAnd either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about it because they had a very balanced view of\nThat one re understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time is right understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not you ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia\nUh and porridge trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little higher like an hour a week as and just be mean to yeah and just be mean to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Worcester", "day": "29"}
