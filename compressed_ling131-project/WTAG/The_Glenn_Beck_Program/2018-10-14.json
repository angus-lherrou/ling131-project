that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage of a nice time to talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nKnow it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and rage an outrageous and headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage so I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean they just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here to Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes we're the we're the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I the Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's\nUltra the whole so tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and\nOur and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened we're going to go really a wry rarely ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups may be a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus\nIn to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people and reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating foe and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have stood up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are it it it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the ... those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nIn Christians in the age of outrageous is to is to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenge a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategic clean you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take
