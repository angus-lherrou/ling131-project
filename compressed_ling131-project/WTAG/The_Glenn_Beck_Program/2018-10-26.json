sincerely has she been imprisoned yet I don't think so and she needs to be she dangerous well she has\nYou know she is violated something that NBC feels passionate about to\nDo well he started to they didn't feel that passionately about it when Jimmy Fallon dressed up in blackface as Chris Rock wait what yeah he dressed up and imitated Chris Rock and yeah but I'm from what network though I'm a little over there\nThat was on NBC always end and the NBC that end up saying that we're ... worked for ... sounded like middle no no it it might be okay for Halloween if you are not making\nFun of someone right so he wasn't making fun\nOf well he was he was kind of making fun of Chris Hughes imitating ... odd it you know it's even more ... than that though and it's it's ... it's despicable that we have to play this game and it's okay for all of them are the Jimmy Kimmel thing with good huh imitating\nCarl Malone do we have that audio yet Sarah my gosh I Am not one has agreed oh we have a rabbit and listen to this is Jimmy Kimmel in blackface\nSometime and night home alone look up and sky and say what the hell's going on and off their full name on other planets\nPhoning home like in the wild home loan rate on TV about white people getting the ... and all kind of hell of a damn thing\nHome alone ever see no flying saucer hisself foot if you do that when we spoke at times\nAlmost say say I saw just\nHang out that's just me kill\nIt's unbelievable and like ... we got about ... you imagine even even talking that way no without blackface just talking that way it would be our last\nDay ... yeah\nI talked to a of a couple of different examples of blackface are being used in comedy fairly recently like in those sunny in Philadelphia was one of the examples we brought up\nThat it's an insult was sending in Philadelphia they did it and they did it as for a minute they're making a point right like that only be more on ... characters on this show would think that that's an appropriate thing\nThis gimme came up with is just saying hey I'm black and I'm Carl Malone is just him mocking a black person\nYeah a mind the way he the only thing that speak the only thing that's funny about that is the way he speaks yeah yeah that's it mhm I mean play that again telling me the joke in here other than the way he's speaking what was it the Ebonics\nThat what they call in and the person that's the only other I think he's doing right now listen to this\nI mean the joke do some time and I call look up and sky and say what the hell going on up there\nFall into another planet phone home like in the\nHome loan rate on TV about why people getting out the violin taken all on a halo effect on family stuff down\nI mean they're not a single jokes no air and honest to sing retiring as Karl Malone always did no not always but often do you can referring to himself in third person and it's a random topic of the only other part of that they said yeah and he's a black face right like better so unbelievable for getting\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more because Jimmy Fallon is not a political enemies and Kimmel has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that bit he's friends with Chris Rock writing\nBut the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can hear it as a liar legality for mentioning it but you know like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what she said\nWas weight but if you are if you\nAre holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making fun of and she's not making fun of Diana Ross well isn't\nThat what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question teaches ... ...\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about this as we were getting close to we're getting close to Halloween ... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally African Americans have a superhero
