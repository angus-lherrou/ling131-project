there for talks on that caravan of thousands of Central American migrants headed to the U.S border\nInstead of this is the situation that I think the fed finds itself in as you're seeing signs of the housing market is slowing in in the housing market is a major engine for growth both in terms of what people were able to borrow in order to hate generate spending that way\nBut also the the economic activity grades as far as jobs for plumbers carpenters electric age back or you name it you run down the list\nAnd so I think the fed is between a rock and a hard place because there is inflation coming because the labor market is so tight right now and that's not going away anytime soon I don't think\nAt the same time you have a slowing economy as as these numbers indicate on this that I think is going to become an issue at some point next year the fed can't have both they can't say hey we're going to chop inflation and we're going to have a strong housing market you can't have both at this point I think that's what this data is telling me\nThey're going to have to pick what is more important to them\nKeeping inflation in check or keeping the economy moving\nIn the if you go back to the Paul Volcker days Paul Volcker raised rates through the roof because he said it's more important to keep inflation in check and keep the dollar strong\nThey keep the economy moving in the short term\nI don't know where Jay Powell is going to land on yeah but he's going to face it it's not going to be the magnitude of what Volcker faced but it's a similar decision and historical precedent says that Volcker was the outlier because every other time we've seen this\nMost of the fed chairs typically say yeah let's keep things moving and try to keep the economy ... that's what we've typically seen so that's where I come up with my thought hey we're probably seeing one hike next you're not the three they're guiding towards\nThis data point is kind of the first one that really suggest hey there's there's really something that's going on here that the fed is going to have to\nAttention to the data point that I think could easily offset that say if you said okay we do have a declining housing market but we got some retail sales at the end of this year that just knocked the roof off that could that could change things for the fact that can really push them towards raising interest rates again in that two to three hikes next year rather than just\nOne to talk about what's going on in China they reported their second quarter or a third quarter GDP I'm Sorry a and it came in at six point five percent year over year which begs the question what the heck is the real GDP their cars six point five certainly isn't what's actually going on\nYeah I always tend to discount whenever whenever the Chinese government puts out bad economic data you always got discounted a little bit\nBut six point five percent for China's not very good anyway that's the worst GDP Growth number that they've seen since the first quarter of two thousand nine and a anyone falling at home you remember what the economy was like back in first quarter of two thousand and not [noise]\nYeah wasn't particularly strong no wasn't particularly good so ... ... again it raises the question hey if if they're telling you what six point five percent and slowing how slow is it actually is a three and a half to four and a half I have no idea but\nWe know from you know just kind of what we've seen in divergence is before numbers between what China tells you and then what their electricity consumption is near gas consumption we know it's not usually what they're telling you it's just a question of how far off it is\nUm but either way you look at this China is going through a period of slowing and I think you can\nDraw a pretty direct line there between what we're seeing from a trade perspective and the slowing growth that's\nGoing on yeah I mean if you want to take the pessimistic view sure you can say the second largest world economy is slowing down but if you're an American you want to be optimistic view it appears that you know our trade tariffs are having a good impact it appears that we are intentionally trying to and succeeding and slowing down the Chinese economy\nSo this is going to be something that does bear watching you know we're ... it's gonna be interesting to see if this continues into the fourth quarter there but trying to coming in again with its slowest GDP Growth number since two thousand nine\nObviously an economy like that can't grow Seventy percent a year for ever but still it's just that things are not uh not all rosy in China at the moment cheer let's talk tipping because this is a it is just a nominal\nTopic to get into so that you two have been into you've gone into whether it's you know bakeries coffee shops wherever it may be that there's a lot of these new point of sale terminals maybe they're run by square pay ... a ... there's a whole bunch of matter there where it's pretty much an eye pad\nAnd then the cashier enters in what you're going to pay and then they flip it over to see you can just signing your car sign your name and swipe and everything\nBut when they flip it over and show it to you\nEven though you're just maybe picking up a coffee or maybe they're still a spot none of spot but the first prompted hey how much tip do you want to give\nIt a lot of people\nAre finding themselves in the awkward situation of saying well gee I'd I don't want to tip you anything just 'cause all you're doing is handing me something across the counter why am I tipping you for that what what is going on here\nYeah or maybe in some circumstances you pay three fifty for something and you know leave the back in the day you would say okay here's the fifty cents and cherish I'll put that in the tip jar right\nOn these are prompting much larger tests you know the general what you're seeing out there is if you're purchasing an item for less than ten dollars the options are one two or three dollars and if it's over ten that I think it's Fifteen\nNo Eighteen twenty or twenty five per cent tip levels as the default\nNow that ... can be changed by the individual uh owner okay so they say okay we want to change the default there\nBut a lot of them aren't necessarily doing that and so I guess both are individuals who are buying stuff as well as cashiers are saying man this is really awkward you know cashier flip it over and you know you bought it for you know two dollar muffin or something like that and it's asking you if you want to give a two dollar tip right and you're sitting there and you're like\nLook I really liked the cashier man but I'm not tipping you a hundred percent on that\nMarket and like it's good but it's not that good and you're nice but you're not that nice and by the way it will smelly so hey let's let's get this cleaned up around here that OK well here's a practical example\nThat I'm gonna throw out that has driven me crazy there is a brewery that shall remain nameless that I frequent than go pick up I'll do I go buy a bunch of cans there because they

year to date they had a pretty big beat on earnings quarterly profit came in at a buck twelve a share which beat by three cents but revenue what the street really cares about ah was above forecasts as well are they are getting sales growth of four percent\nOr so yeah as you mentioned the stock that is you know usually a pretty calm do weather is up nearly a over eight point three percent at this point in time or you know amongst a time where it's difficult for it to compete you know one of the areas of Proctor and gamble had really succeeded at in the past was getting that prime\nShelf space

information so the the mobile payments ... which\nI use a decent amount Tucker you frequently frequently uses Mike\nI don't use that frequently I I Do use it you know if I'm going out to dinner with\nA group of friends or something like that I use it but that's pretty much the only circumstances that happens and what what is it do for people who aren't familiar where so for anyone not familiar it is a you know in allegedly secure system for you to transfer money from one person's bank to another\nRather than having to get that person's bank account number and you know full set of information you use this application as long as they're also signed up for it you just need to search for um\nUh you see there you know their profile picture a lot you know when you log in there and you can just seamlessly transfer them funds for free yeah there's no charge to transferring money between one individual to another individual\nTo the big thing that uh they saw on invincible by the way is owned by pay pal they bought them I think maybe four or five years ago now\nUm so the volume of payment that they process in the third quarter roast Seventy eight percent year over year to Seventeen billion dollars still only a little bit more than ten percent of pay pal hundred and forty three billion total volume for the quarter\nBut the big thing that they're starting to see\nIs that more people are participating not just in the free transfers that you do to get money to a friend\nBut what they call monetize ... action twenty four percent of bend mobile users are participating in that type of transaction now that's up from Seventeen percent in the second quarter and only Thirteen percent in May of this year ... almost doubling in a span of six months\nYeah and I I was always kind of curious when I first started using the tap exactly what ... was doing to make money and this appears to be there because they don't offer ads they're not trying to sell you on here which is not yet at least nice and refreshing yeah not not yet\nBut where they are monetize ing seems to be on consumer to business and business to business transactions where you are linking a credit card to your account and say your order and a meal for delivery and you use your bend mode to complete that transaction they're keeping a three percent transaction fee on that\n[noise] so they're keeping that above and beyond what the credit card process had\n... he's so yeah er which seems like it'd be pretty pretty substantial amount that you'd be paying you're talking like a ... percent total then when you factor in credit card fees yeah so perhaps they have some sort of deal worked out with the credit cards to you know less than that a little bit but a\nPretty substantial uh but you know in the same thing happens with pay pal pay pal I think you pay two point nine percent on those same transaction so um they really where the opportunity lives for them is they're starting to get integrated with you know companies so\nWhen you log in to grab hub or eat you can log you're more information right in there and you can just seamlessly you know not not entering the credit card information just boom ... real quick logging to bend mow and complete the transaction\nLet's go back to our poll question of the day since this is somewhat related to this or do you feel more pressure to tip on eye pad cash registers Tucker what kind of results do we have to this\nPoint so far still pretty early here but fifty six point two percent of our listeners say no they do not feel more pressure when tipping on me I had a cash registers and we also have a couple techs coming in or one out of the five oh wait no pressure at all I Know tip every time with al ...\nA year where you're not a waiter or waitress you don't serve me you don't get tips and then a out of the nine seven eight hey guys spot on with the tipping I refused to tip for take out\nSo that's the next place that I was going to do you get a tip on taking no\nNever I Do I Do unless it's a large order so to when\nI it depends on the type of take out but if I'm buying something where they need to individually package a bunch of stuff that they would otherwise need to just serve on my plate I figure they're putting in at least as much work to some degree as to disturbing it so I tend to tip a few bucks on doing take out if it's something like\nSushi where they've got you know kind of a complicated order to complete and separate if I'm buying a box of\nPizza that's a different story I typically on on take out I'll still tip ten percent just 'cause a lotta times ah workers do share tips that pool tips a lot of restaurants fail and so on something that take out from what would normally be a sit down restaurant I'll still tip ten percent just because hey I'm I'm not getting the same service that I was outwardly\nIf I were sitting down there but all the back and work is still being done so I Do still tip ten percent on take out orders\nThough obviously I'm not hip and you know twenty twenty five and\n... out to the delivery guy or a day of the week obviously but um you know on a smaller water for two people I'm I'm not if it's a large order than yell to\nWind was higher dot com\n[noise] stay on top of breaking financial news by becoming a member of berries brigade log onto financial exchange does come and sign up today\nHoover as they prepare for their IPO's now it sounds like it's going to be in the first half of next year they had that lovely um [noise]\nArticle in the wall Street Journal about how they're targeting a hundred and twenty billion dollar valuation earlier this week which I think it's just pure messaging under the half of the banks that are working for them if they are now apparently testing a quote on demand a labor service uh in order to provide\nEmployees are temp employees pretty much for whether it's you know one off of events like weddings and things like that maybe it's you need someone to come in for a couple of weeks to do data entry but they're trying to get into this business which leads me to the question why on earth do they think they're going to be good at this\nI actually am going to disagree with you here I I think that they\nHave the potential to be able to pull this off um you know they're already pretty good at dictating specific terms to a non I go to a contractors um they've got a pretty big network of people that they could potentially bring into this\nUm I think it will be difficult for them to do this in such a tight labor market but I think I think that they could be successful with this the only thing that I think prohibits them from it is that their reputation has taken such a hit over the last few years that people might be hesitant to sign up for it but\nYou know ... if let's say let's say you live in town and you don't own a car you can't drive ... uh but you're looking to pick up a few bucks\nI could've seen myself in my early twenties stand you know I'll go work a or I'll go work a wedding at this place I've got a you know I've got a suit that I can wear and I'll go show up and go surf people they're not sure\nI guess my question isn't so much whether people would sign up to do the work it's what's the incentive for if someone's having a wedding to go look at ... instead of someone who specialize in that exact particular thing that they probably already have relationships with I Would hope price\nThat's however succeeded in what they're currently doing but he loses money on that stuff they do you do I I just I look at it in in where's the long term value what can they what can they do that someone else can't I don't I just I I don't know if I see this being of real value for them\nI yeah I think there's potential for them you know given their scale given they're already existing expertise on paying these people on\nGetting them into their network I think they have the potential to really do something here\nAnd if they do I can see them severely under cutting you know the other staffing agencies that currently do this today and yeah you know we always say well no this company's got such expertise in it that you couldn't just step in and do that but you know what there are plenty of companies that Cohen disrupt industries that you might have an area of expertise and it\nGood point a story in the wall Street Journal the headline is oil prices fall further on rising us oil supplies OPEC report says to this I say well on those just for just a week ago all that we're hearing

it is whenever whenever I see a story about the price of oil\nSomeone's trying to sell me something seem they ended up just oil [laughter] that's what they're trying to sell it in a bank you taught your welcome [laughter]\nThank you ... what I'm trying to say is you know like every time that we've seen this it's oh experts say this is going to do we've seen\nBefore that they don't know what is actually going to happen and if you want a clear example to go back to the end of twenty Fifteen or oil futures prices for most of the twenty sixteen where the Seventy dollar a barrel range and we went down to twenty seven dollars a barrel in February is sixteen\nAnd none of the experts saw it coming so I discount an awful lot when it comes to quote oil experts\nFolks do you have a trust to

know\nYou have to pick everything you you have to pay its a bucket of capital his a\nCashier putting all the cash or you got an ... year okay I feel more badly just by the customers and cashier they're going to get over it they'll figure it out yeah customers are the ones that no one behind you Chuck within I don't feel judged okay\nYou know I can deal with cashiers like I can deal with it you know but I was cash you know worked at that job I Know how it is so so did you ... are you know did you like not appreciate customers as much because they weren't tipping\nNo tipping is what bothered me so much was customers who were actually route throughout any process more like typical like you don't know necessarily what a customer's going through they might be going through financial tough times maybe they can't tip you the same way that they normally would [laughter] so I don't blame customers you know 'cause you don't know what's going on under the hood there\nBut that doesn't mean again just because like you can't tip doesn't mean you can't be nice because it doesn't cost anything to be nice to a cashier cars look it's a tough job sometimes so what what got more under my skin wasn't customers who didn't hit me it\nWas customers who are rude to me for absolutely no reason because look just\nAnd you don't have to do that that's something easily within your control a tech set of the five oh wait a I think feeling pressure or over this tipping situation is a little bit odd no one is putting pressure on you so maybe it's just guilt [noise]\nWell it could be you know my mother worked hard on guilt maybe paying off you know let's talk about\nDoubt du pont they recorded a four point six billion dollar charge or in the agriculture unit what's this related to\nLike you just have seen a pretty big slow down and you know declining valuations of the agricultural sector as a whole largely because of terrorists\nAnd so with all the accusations that acquisitions that they have made they've really had to take a good hard look at the value of their agricultural unit and in this case they had to record that yeah you know what what we thought this stuff was worth was actually worth four point six billion dollars less than ... and that's how much\nThis the biggest trade related\nYou know a good chunk but I don't think you would take a four point six billion dollar charge off if you thought a hundred percent of that was trade related biggest trade related can be temporary ... so I I think a good portion of this has to be you know ... the goodwill and do other stuff here just isn't worth what it was um\n... it's a but some of it straight delayed it a good a good chunk of it's got to be but not all that we haven't talked\nIn a while now about a Amazon H cute too which is probably the single biggest a project that somehow you know taxpayers don't realize they're going to be on the hook for when it's all said and done\nAll these tax breaks that Amazon's likely going to get but Amazon apparently is revisiting some cities as they are trying to wrap this decision making process up by the end of the year ah it was ... when was it that we first heard about this was it about a year ago now\nOh God I don't know it feels like decades ago that we've been talking about this I think it was about a year ago but apparently they are doing bad too so the production wall that we have was dating back to September seventh of twenty Seventeen just over a year or a year now\nAnd so I guess apparently they've gone back now to New York city to Newark New Jersey to Chicago and they've also been following up with a couple of cities like Miami in DC a couple of cities just haven't heard from them at all and a few months apparently Raleigh North Carolina hasn't heard from them I guess but\nSo the only thing that I think you can derive from this story because I feel like we do this every week oh Jeff Bezos responded in Petra so they're going to choose that his best was tracking yeah I think the ... it's like a A R where's Waldo type of scenario here\nBut I I think the only real thing that I've been able to garner from this is there seems to be a slight\n...\nI don't know preference for a metro city area rather than more of a rural area\nI'm standing by my prediction that this is all miss direction they've already built in Boise and you know you're just going to they're just going to behave like we've got Amazon Boise open ended no one had any coup was coming in there it's done and it's finished [noise] that's that's what I'm sticking\nWith now I think it's going to be a very big city I I Would very much doubt that it can be New York New York or Chicago I just don't think that those states have the right tax situation to allow Amazon to be there but I can be around we'll see\nWhat let's ask a different question we we've asked before you know where do we think Amazon ends up with the second headquarters when do you think they finally make a decision\nI have to hope that they do it by on the year ... ah\nDecember thirtieth December fifteenth\nNovember twenty nine oh\nAll right I'm going November twenty ninth they're making a decision that you can put those up on the progress and might have to get what why else would I have done that higher there\n[laughter] there's no point in me do that when I put it on
