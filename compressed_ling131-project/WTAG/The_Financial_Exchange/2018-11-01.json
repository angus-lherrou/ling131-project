[noise] Halloween all things fake scary you know [noise]\nAh about fake news [noise] fake news will St\nNews Israel I Want to give you an example I wanted to bring him through part of what my day is which is constantly consuming information I don't know how people do this job before smartphones tablets the Internet things like that I just\nDon't know how they did it\nThey were brilliant you know they go to the news a stand and by newspapers from all over the country read the magazines everything I don't know how they did it I mean I I have all the information I Need right at my fingertips on I consume it\nYou know I Can't tell you the last time I completed a book I started a good one this summer and I still on line ... stand I haven't finished it but I read more than the average person every day\nAnd it's you know\nBut it's just that so many different things now it's not a book cover to cover sending me last night I was watching the news because of the whole Whitey Bolger thing and I don't watch a lot of nightly news\nBut I wanted to see what folks were reporting on and especially the Boston station so I went through the Boston stations I happened to be on channel four WB easy the CBS affiliate and they had a story about the\n\nVisit of the president to the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd I was sitting watching this story and I noticed something\nThey mentioned in this story and had interviews with people\nWho were\nUpset about the president being there and pointing the finger at the president for his rhetoric being one of the causes of this unspeakable and disgusting act of violence\nThey talked about the man who is charged with the crime and they missed one thing while this man was pointing\nAnti Jewish\nIt's I some medic rhetoric out there just hate speak out there he was also telling everyone how much he hated Donald Trump now you can't have it both ways\nYou can't say Donald Trump's rhetoric is responsible for this and then point to a man who does something disgusting like this heinous like this and say he was motivated by Trump he hates Trump\n... off I think this president one\nOf the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did\nShe later apologized for that here's the bad part Jake Tapper CNN he was moderating the panel discussion where she said that he didn't say a word to her\nNow you're on my show and you say something like that or you say something equally idiotic an irresponsible I'm going to call you on and say whoa whoa whoa whoa what what did you just say\nAnd you know I Do it even with people who agree with me if they say something I feel as inappropriate on the show I'll say hey hey what what what was that Jake Tapper what did we hear from him\n[noise] right nothing now there's just a little bit\nOf the news he knew one day and that's just for me just like picking them out quick mad at him I really sat down for an entire day and went to redo everything with a fine tooth comb what I Would find and you think it's bad for the president to say fake news\nAnd the media gets upset when he calls him fake news and yet you have the media saying he's radicalize the more people than ISIS\n\nOh by the way did you hear what Hillary Clinton said\nHere's one final piece um she ... she was being interviewed by someone and they mixed up Eric Holder with Cory Booker\nBoth black men Hillary Clinton said while they all look alike look it up\nShe said oh you won't find it in a lot of places she said it\nFake news to listening to the gym please don't show you're safe space [noise]\nPretty scary when you're [noise]\nYou're Whitey Bolger uranium hell no leave it up Danny I Love that background [noise] here in hell and the first guy you bump into is Albert you know and then you figure out that you were both killed by the same\nSame guy good morning everyone happy Halloween prank the mob edition\nThe gym police do show paid five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six I get deeper into this with you the whole Freddie gee is thing\nThe whole connection is so wild insists if somebody had said to me hey Whitey Bulger's going to get killed by Freddie gee is Saudi is she is\nReally how and then yesterday just all came together as a as reality let's go to Joe when she wants to talk about Whitey Bolger out in the Brookfield pillow Joanne\nCrowe oh I'm All right I think I don't know if Rick Perry em\nSo they don't worry about well I don't think we all know what the top part of a guy by failing\nYeah during this time you\nWere running running coyote and quit their pay anyone can connect for that reason why he got well I\nThink has he gotten killed by the pro when I'm Out some high fly by a foreign land yeah I when I got it right by the way\nI can I can still find a job and let me just for the for everybody else who hasn't read it I'm white and Whitey Bolger no some of the reporting about Whitey Bulger's murder they said Whitey was just about to come forward and talk about the um\nThe informants program and the FBI and ... and and rat on people you know in that and the and the laws that they broke I got to be honest with you I read the story and I didn't bring it up today to him and you know why\nIt reminded me of this which is often reading stories when you have a scum bag gang banger\nWho is just shot you're always hearing the story like he was just about to turn his life around he was in Raleigh just going to enroll in a GED program oh and and ah he he started up his own rap label\nYou know like it to me it was like why he wasn't going to do that and and if what he was going to do that he wasn't murdered by Freddie gee is to keep them quiet there's no conspiracy here Freddie gee is is a dirt bag and what is this is a psychotic dirt bag\nHe's been he's been in trouble with the law since he was fourteen he\nDoesn't like rats he was put in prison by rats he believes even though he's a Greek and could never be made man he believes he's part of a lot closer no stroke\nWhich he actually was under Anthony are a lot of who was a maid man and then who who ratted out on him became a federal witness\nWhen he knew he was going to be in jail for the rest of his life and he put Fred and his brother tie in jail for the rest of their lives because they arranged for Frankie Roach another dirt bag to kill Alberto\nSo I I I read it I didn't I didn't buy the connection and I really didn't I really didn't talk about it but I'm Glad you brought it up\nBut ah Joanne I don't think I don't think there's any truth or I Do think the FBI um yes but in this respect the FBI was dirty it was hard to find the good guys and the bad guys in this whole thing\nIraq and found out what Congress men remembering oh man I'm kind of a writer and I mean guys and prevent the other fellow\nYeah yeah Robert Miller Robert Mueller is not the boy scout everybody thinks he is no no no not at all no beyond reproach just like we were told James Comey was beyond reproach rice\nAnd then games companies out there selling a book like a whore if you know what I mean and then we find out what it what he was like how you operate it in the FBI he wasn't a boy scout none at all\nRight well that Mullah Omar by congressman Lou ain't gonna let\nNobody can look it up and read it because it off or go to our show I mean I like to go I think the guy yeah we are talking to 'em which I haven't read yet [laughter] theloop might have know about them at the heart that\nNow I don't know if I go to I mean look everybody should have known about nine eleven and it was a failure I don't think it was a conspiracy but joann thank you very much for Asian and I think the real story\nHere is that Whitey knows where Hillary's emails are\nThey ... I think pretty genius as a Democrat is big big lefty no he's not a big lefty you know this whole thing started for me\nWhen I broke the story yes yes some patting myself on the back about Garry Westerman\nDisappearing Gary Westerman\nWas\nDating a relative of I'm Anthony are a lot of ... the little guy and Gary Westerman park his\nIn the parking lot on west side outside the big why\nAnd disappeared\nDownload the old years later his body was found [noise] uh buried in agawam not too far from there actually not too far from where I Lived in Iowa\nAnd he was killed by Freddie genius and tie and Anthony are a lot of was part of the murder\nAnd I broke that story\nAnd", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "01"}
