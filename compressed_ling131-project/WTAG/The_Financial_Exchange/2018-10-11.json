and you are saying you're not going to be civil until your back in charge again that's a threat to you as you sit in your car right now when you drive to work that's a threat against you\nI mean even if you're a Hillary supporter\nWe're gonna have anarchy and we're going to have this stuff going on we're going to have our our politicians attacked with Maxine Waters out there saying hey hey go after them at the supermarket go after them no matter where they are\nBut I'm the only thing that the Republican whom to recognize and respect and strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led

economy or beef producers are going to have to say hey we can't actually pass these costs through the consumers so we can't pass these inflationary costs through west province are going to go down so it means one of those two things\nAnd so I look at all that and it's so similar to the ... we saw right after the super bowl in February where that friday the friday before we got a bang up jobs report in ... for for the month of January\nAnd the following week that Monday eleven hundred and Seventy five points down on the down three days later on Thursday an additional seven hundred and ... points down and we're sitting there going\nTo happen is is is good news bad again is bad news good what what is actually mean and the fact is this is a case where I think investors are so focused on the fear of potential inflation which don't get me wrong I I think that's out there too\nBut I think they couple that with the fact that Jerome Powell a couple of days ago said yeah we think we still have a ways to go on interest rates we don't think we're anywhere near the neutral right we're going to continue to hike and we're going to continue to move forward and I think it was just this combination of things if you look at what actually changed in the last week\nThere was the only things that are out there we get nothing new one midterms we got nothing new on what's going on and you\nKnow about that on ... I I Know we have to get into politics on this but the ah the cabinet thing has awakened to the Republican base in a lot of the country in a way nobody saw but does that change anything from a policy perspective\nA you um that's a good point because you wind up with sort of the kind of divided paralyzed the main thing that we have now with the exception of what happens in the house and\nYou know to what extent is even a ... pinned down by multiple investigations out of the house representatives so I I look at this and I say yeah they ... there's not much moving the needle aside from these inflation fears\nAnd when I look at something along those lines\nThose are things that the market can overcome in the long run because we we saw earlier this year they they did\nOkay the inflation that we thought we were going to see over the first six months to this year didn't materialize at least not in miserable for you know didn't show up in the CPI or the PC or any of those numbers that we look at\nAnd so those are things that the market can get over what it can't get over okay if you do have a material change from a political perspective Italy decides look we can't get along with Germany and we need to leave the euro zone hey that's the material change from how the world is today\nThat something that you don't just get over that you have to completely rebuild your model of how the world looks and how it works\nSo from my perspective worries about inflation\nThings that you can get over especially because Jay Powell could come out\nTomorrow and say hey I Know I said this last week but here's what I really meant by it and all of a sudden this whole thing goes away just like that it's done so\nAnd I tend to look good interest rate hikes from the ... we've had bizarrely low interest rates for ten years and you know it's actually it's been the fed\nGiving the kids a sugar water for ten years and the faster we get back to normal interest rates that can be lowered you know when there's an actual economic downturn to stimulate the economy the faster we unwind the whole ... uh\nYou know taking the streets down to zero experiment the better as far as I'm concerned if it's a little painful in the short term\nAnd let's talk about that a little bit here okay because I think there was a really good case in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis hey we've got to get rates low in order to make sure that the whole thing doesn't fall apart\nBut then keeping them low for so long I think a lot of investors got accustomed to it and they stopped looking at stocks on the fundamental basis of what company can actually continue to exist if things ... and they said hey the punch bowls open why don't we buy shares of test will because it's not going to let them go out of business they'll keep rates low so they can keep borrowing\nThat's not normal though which the ... job and this is my not just my view this is how their charters written ... job is not keep companies and business\nDoesn't say that anywhere in their mandated not hey let's keep the stock market up and keep companies in business the feds mandate control inflation make sure that we are as close to full employment as possible correct so\nFrom my perspective I think a lot of investors got a little bit complacent\nAnd when they finally got down in and said jeep Powell signaling this and now you've got a little inflation showing up in a couple of places they panicked because they may have been out over their skis a little bit\nPanics a reversible you know again you can you can put the genie back in the bottle it takes time took three months to kind of get the market back to normal this spring but it did so I Will get this it's a short term fluctuation I think you're going to see continued volatility\nDo you think that's I mean these things don't go away overnight would you agree\nNo I mean you're at the point where uh it you know ... ... let's remember that were nine and a half years into you know one of the greatest bull markets of all time and you know they don't go on forever and there are\nA corrections and there are changes and you know you've seen in the pressure market or to see treasury straighten round three point to a seven years yeah and you know when the summer they were two point eight so that's been\nYou know for a forty basis point move in the

been twenty times when the ... five hundred created down at least three percent on one day and then if you look forward to month\nThe U.S okay five hundred Ninety percent of the time has rallied almost seven percent so a we've seen this before is where is it is indeed these kinds of moves in markets do happen typically their opportunities to buy a were absolutely right\nNothing fundamentally changed yesterday and if anything the headline that Wall Street journal literally just put out\nProbably if you were calling me on is that a President Trump and she plans to speak at the G twenty coming up in November and from my point of view that actually is is a change and it's good news um so you know that that that's that's my take on on where we are at this moment\nAt on the book to drill down to specific issues are is you're looking around at a individual stocks anything that's looking interesting to you today because it took maybe too much of a pounding over the last week\nYeah my whole portfolio although in in you know I'm I'm kind of ... great good luck I go up you know call it and a half percent\nUm I gave up three percentage points over the past two weeks ago that painful you know you have to go from Canada six and a half but there'll be at a as I look at my portfolio now and I have forty nine name in position\nI'm I've been adding to them on the field that I

you know art where all these celebrities felt imaginative came crashing were selling you know for whatever line\nUm on on Twitter I'm so they they monetize that revenues are growing fifty five percent it's it to its rating under twenty times\nOn and on and it's down sixty percent from hot so you know that's my point there's a real opportunity I wouldn't want to talk about by China but guess what would it be value is right now and I find\nInteresting country and take on China Adam why the heck doesn't Twitter allow what you just described\nI don't know I Wish they would in fact I'm On Facebook

Platform that kind of monitor ... that I Love it\nOut I'm looking at a inflation I Want to circle back to that briefly just 'cause it's it's been in focus the last week both with again Jerome Powell talking a jobs report on friday showing you know three point nine percent wage worth for the third quarter which is outstanding to see and then obviously the PIN number we got the other day\nAnd then all of a sudden you get one of these today where the CPI comes in way weaker than it is no way we could weaker than expected what is going do you have any idea what's happening inflation was 'cause I I continue to look at all these numbers and they don't paint a consistent picture from one to the next is I I I feel a little lost on them\nA while and you're absolutely right there's so many different measures at the fate is traditionally looked at a what's called the P. B. E. or get on and that's running it one night or two you can look at headline CPI depending on the month because it's about a number you know it it might be Seventy nine\nSo there are all these different measures of inflation and the thing that I'm watching more closely than any of those headline inflation numbers\nIs way to grow and you know you just mentioned in one number you know the bureau of ticks a number I'm also looking at companies the fact that\nStarbucks is not going to start paying everybody Fifteen dollars the fact that ... one of my long um and it got it\nSomewhat today by the way but it but it got it a couple of weeks ago when I noted on a conference call that it's going to start paying people more that'll cut into marches lately I also expect to get a pass that on the on the wage growth of the a wage price spiral is what my former\nEconomics professor Alan Blinder Chris that used to always talk about it goes one when you start\nSpiraling wages and prices that when you have an issue fortunately I'm we're still\nWay below where that become an issue um with the the elect number it your point nine percent it's\nNot until you get to about three eight three nine that worry but a wage that that's what I'm focused on more than anything else they're finally starting to ... which is good hard working Americans may or they spend more than ... hurting one reason people\nBut not yet it hasn't yet walked over where it scares me very good at and we've got to run but thanks for joining us\nOh shut up you know I Wish we could go and if they want to talk about for having me\nAbsolutely that's Adam Johnson from bull's eye brief dot Tommy put new picks up every Sunday Morning you can sign up right now at bull's eye brief dot com were done for the hour we'll be back in just a little bit with more on the financial exchange [laughter]\n\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty age E N double duty AG HD Worcester and I argue

focus\nStocks might be the single worst thing you can oh okay I was stocks but I don't hold them for you know my car payment I Need to make next month it just doesn't make sense and\nYou know the one upside uh to what we're seeing with interest rates is you know you look go shopping for an online CD or online savings account and those numbers are finally starting to look you can you can find two years CDs at two seven five almost three percent now and if that's money you need twenty four months from now or you know in in my experience\nUh the last upside to you know money that you could have had in the stock market for two years is so much less painful than the downside of money left in the stock market to watch\nWhat say that you've got ten thousand dollars that you put away for a car you know you need a car in the next year okay is it worth trying to get that up to eleven thousand with the danger that it could fall down to seven\nIn my book it's not just because you don't know what the market's going to do in the short term so I I tend to agree with you on that this does lead us to our poll question of the day how worried are you about the markets sell off very worried slightly worried are not worried at all Tucker what kind of results are we seeing in a in the polls us for\nA leading the way right now is a amongst our listeners are not worried at all at forty two percent fall by slightly worried at forty percent and uh finishing distant third is very worried at Seventeen percent\nAnd I I like our audience I think they've dealt with threats you know it's ... and again it's not saying that you know you shouldn't look at this and say gee that's interesting that the market felt you know three and a half percent yesterday\nBut if you've allocated yourself properly it shouldn't make a difference in your overall long term plan and that's that's the big thing that you need to be focused on what to talk a little bit about what President Trump is focused on because we had a couple of comments from him yesterday specifically are with regards to the Federal Reserve\nA with him saying that the fed had quote\nJohn loco arose rather was going loco\n... he he's bilingual who knew what's what's your take on this ah it it's a\nYou know it's a unique approach to ah speaking about the fed or president has unique approach to speaking out a lot of different things for you know the past forty four presidents typically a you had them not making critical comments about fed and fed policy and sort of\nYou know trying to stay out of that and um you know it's part of the whole deal that I think you get with this current president he's going to speak his mind in a way that we have not\nBeen a particularly accustomed to before this\nAnd um you know I Would say on the on the merits of it um it looks to me like the fed is being anything but logo you know now is the time with uh what we're seeing with inflation with economic growth if now is not the time to get back to a scene interest rate policy when is [noise]\nAnd I think that you know a lot of people talk about okay is you know is it appropriate that the president's talking about the fed and this and that and to the feds a bunch of grown ups they can fend for themselves so I'm not worried about you know to the president break the fourth wall and talk to the fed when he's\nThe grownups they can deal with themselves they're all adults they all knew how to handle themselves they're all mature people who can you know deal with things like this what I'm curious about in in what I kind of get out and this you know because everyone look look to that and said oh you know the ... supposed to be independent how could you do this I look at it and ask\nWhat if he's right okay where is he writes ... is the wrong and from my perspective\nI don't think he's right on this but here's why I don't think he's right when you look at what the fed is doing here they have a dual mandate okay their mandate is to keep inflation in check and maintain full employment okay there's supposed to do both of those things\nWhere the current policy that they are are they are doing both of those things inflation is in check it's not too hot and we are at full employment so when I look at what the fed is doing\nI don't really have a huge problem with it in the interim okay now they could get to a point where they start to escalate to quickly and maybe they start to cause a slow down that leads to unemployment okay hasn't happened yet hasn't happened so I'm not going to criticize them for something that they haven't done to this point\nThey don't have a mandate to maintain stock prices in the narrow range so\nI don't really get upset at the fed if the market you know it was kind of waking up to this and saying gee there's a threat here that we didn't really pricing properly and now we need the prices in that the markets fault not the feds\nAnd you don't have to worry about mid term elections for weeks\nNo no it's ... and so when when I look at this I say you know it's it's it's interesting 'cause everyone jumped right to oh should the president be doing this I said look it doesn't matter whether he should or not the fed can handle themselves\nThe question is if he writes is is he on the money on this end to this point the fed has neither caused a recession nor have they cause additional inflation and so when I look at it I say\nHey I don't think the criticisms warranted if he wants to say it go ahead to drill pelican handle themselves and if you're shocked by the president saying shocking things\nYou probably need to get a wake up wake up ... wherever you been for the last three years so I don't have a problem with him saying it because again the fed can deal with it\nBut the interesting thing is pay like ... if their merit behind this and that's where I think the meat really is on this let's take a quick break when we come back Steve Moore is going to join us

I mean look at all the overtime games this year or two\nTon of 'em and and the the the games the more competitive\nAnd there's the NFL is a quarterback driven league at this point oh yeah that was all the rules against the defenses yeah there are so many good quarterback like whether you're talking you know people making their first starts like Patrick homes or someone like that you have interesting stories in terms of quarterbacks to new locations you got her cousin's going up to Minnesota\nYou know you've got a lot of good quarterbacks now where'd you go back you know five or ten years ago\nAnd the picture was just like there were a lot of teams that just didn't have a chance you know they they get on the field and it's a great you're starting you know Chad Pennington again great you're going to look like you have nothing that you can do their wares this year it's\nHey you know we're the Cleveland Browns we've been awful forever\nBut let's see what Baker may feel ... you know it's just that there's a little bit more interest especially in some cities that I think down and out for a while there are other cities that are going to continue to be down and out for a while but it seems to be more competitive as a whole\nSo the anthem protests and everything like that has had zero effect on the ratings this year you know and all the time they're not showing the old for that\nAnymore and I also wonder you know we're way has the uh current capital Nike ad campaign and somebody said that to that sort of pulled some energy on that whole issue away from the NFL and put it into Nike and that's probably good for football\n[noise] the thing that I still find fascinating on that whole thing is you know you of Nike sponsoring the NFL", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "11"}
