job suggested a wide range of industries from finance to recruitment are opening up to the idea of a shorter work week and you know\nIt it may may pay off well back in Nineteen Seventy four when the British Government introduced a three day work week following in energy shortage a national survey reported that productivity went up five percent\nInteresting could this really work or is it going to make people lazy how about Wednesdays off in the summer of these are all of\nThe ideas being bounced around by industry but let's bring in somebody much smarter than me to talk about it he's a\nWorkplace culture expert Bobby Albert good morning Bobby\nMorning at a pleasure to be on your show\nNo thank you for coming on so he's really coming\nWell it may uh you know we're very\nFortunate we live in a a word that we have is booming economy and every company is looking for an edge a to in recruitment and retention of employees\nYou know we're faced with is very low in a unemployment and there's more job openings and they are people that are seeking jobs and uh [noise] it\nIt's very possible that this a four day work week may calm a and some companies are\nImplementing it uh but what's\nDriving the also behind the scenes from the employer's\nPerspective is that ... to increased productivity and what\nThey want they want their uh employees that come to work everyday sided with a passion and within ... but a four day work week is no substitute\nBalls or poor workplace culture it's like trying to solve the problem versus a root cause and it's like a a ... taking on a mission and\nTrying to help them feel better but it does nothing to make them well so\n... are very much a track or two of the work life balance flexibility that can be offered for a four day work week but let me just\nA and you know\nA papal forty hours a week and only they only work thirty two are yeah they can do that so so uh they're probably going to increase the number of hours they do that but millennials\nBecause this work life balance is so important to them that they may be willing to uh to be paid only thirty two hours a week and uh because of the work of\nLike some ... we're talking with Bobby Alberta workplace culture scratch who's about maybe a four day work week\nComing to an employer near you maybe your employer what about this concept of the Wednesdays off in the summer that you give people a break mid week so you work Monday Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday\nThat uh it made the ban on a you know what our\nCountry you live and if you live in a metro area versus a an area that is a a you know that uh it doesn't take very long to drive to work but for people that have to\nUh to me you know a an hour and a half how it'll or two hours a day or longer\nA four day work week is going to be attracted to 'em but you know if they if they end up having to work ten hours a day maybe some family things that may not be attracted to them\nBut you know if I can suggest is what will really increased productivity in the workplace is that the employees no matter what you know if you're middle any hills or gender ... generation X. are boomers are the generations either just coming\nAll level wall the same thing from there and for for them to be excited about coming to work at night is the care for me\nDo I belong here cannot contribute toward the

suspicious packages now I'm Dave Anthony to more intercepted this morning one sent to a democratic senator the other an ex Obama intel official turn Trump critic Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more life from Washington\nYou're not investing in exports to begin with because the dollar stronger and then also you're sitting there saying gee I've got these tariffs that are out there that are looming and I don't know what the situation is on that front or and so that's a concern if you're a business owner as well so I think those are major contributors to this\nThe dollar issue you know might go away but it's something that could get a little bit worse before it gets better there\nUm and the other thing to keep in mind on this or GDP report here is you know one thing that may reverse itself and that may make the fourth quarter look a little bit better we did see a spike in imports in this quarter with a lot of companies trying to import goods before tariffs went into effect\nSo that is something that did create a little bit more drag in this quarter here and that could reverse itself and maybe you know companies say okay now we need to source more domestically and you could get a bounce back\nIn that business fixed investment number but it's something that you know it's if it's a concern just because we haven't seen this in two plus years now\nAnd it's it's just unusual to see a decline like that from where we\nWere I have concerns about it but I'm going to take the optimistic view and I think I'm going to say that going through the end of the year here we're going to have consumer spending pick up to a level that maybe it reverses this business trend that\nWe will see maybe it maybe I'm wrong about this but I think that consumer spending especially through the end of

expected Mike's but what how would you describe yourself cautiously optimistic is that a fair\nI I I just only because I hear everyone you know you're calling for you and we're right in the middle of a big market volatility and I hear everyone around calling for recession and I just don't see it so I don't think that the GDP report does anything to tell me that we are headed imminently towards recession\nI Do get concerned about decreases in business spending but that can reverse quickly\nMike cautiously optimistic Chuck more cautiously pessimistic ... will go from there let's talk about a couple of companies that reported earnings after the bell yesterday there both tech companies\nAmazon and alphabet both reporting\nA and both down significantly today after reporting Amazon now off about eight point five percent right now alphabet stock currently off about four point eight percent so both down notes north of four percent and both times with similar as you're not the exact same but similar issues net\nRevenue is a little bit weaker than expected and margins being pressured\nYeah unfortunately for Google they've got the that combined with a lot of regulatory issues that Amazon is currently facing right now so that's been a bit of a combined whack against their stock price today and you can take a look at you know you can look at the chart and see that they've been under combined pressure there [noise] um you know and Amazon's case\nIt's just a story of ... and maybe this is just to you know one quarter type of issue but it seems to be a story of they can't continue to grow at the rate that they've grown up forever\nAnd perhaps expectations were just a little bit too lofty here for this company so they saw the profits that were in line but revenue drops that we're a little bit of a surprise\nUh pretty much across the board you know even the Amazon Web services division which has been the you know profit center for the whole company over the last few years even that you know it didn't shrink but it's a slow down as they saw more competition coming out of Google and Microsoft\nYeah the ... and certainly I think both of these companies you know one of the big questions that I think a lot of investors tend to have his look you know Amazon has been so good for so long why don't I just put my whole portfolio into that company\nWill just because they're not based on what they're doing today they're based on projections of growth Ryan ... and and so forth and that's why you see in a time where by the way the S P five hundred just entered into correction territory meaning a it is more than ten percent off\nA of it's a lot of it's all time high now temper that Amazon right now is down twenty percent okay from its high of just over two thousand fifty dollars a share so the risk with a company like Amazon you take on because the valuation so lofty\nThere's more room for it to follow it has fallen since the start of October about twice as much as the rest of the market\nSure yeah absolutely and if you if you were one of those that bought back in September you're getting almost you know definitely kicking yourself a little bit

wrong\nEverything it can just struggling with this company ... it seems to be a pretty common issue that we're seeing with a number of different um social media companies insofar as they are managing to extract a little bit more revenue and profit from their users but their growth of daily actor users is declining as\nSo it may actually Snapchat side declined to drop and daily active users\nAh they expect to continue losing some customers but they are are delivering a little bit more revenue from those customers that they have but at the end of the day you've got a a a sinking ship here or potentially if they continue to lose customers unless they find a way to get them back\nSo that's what Wall Street cares about they're not terribly interested in the proper numbers the revenue numbers they want to see what those daily active users are doing and therefore stock is off nearly Fifteen Percent right now\nWith a lot of these social media networks there's a lot of chatter that oh you know this app redesigned didn't workers that one didn't do these speech\nHow much of this is just people hate these things now I don't know if anyone ever say gee I really love Snapchat or wow I Love these like\nI don't see anyone walk around like oh these are great systems I see and being like man it's awful but it's the only way I can talk to my grandkids are the only way that I can get the news that I Need and it's all like it's so grudgingly accept it as a part of life now but no one's excited about them\nYeah it doesn't seem like there's a terribly large amount of excitement I again I'm not I I think we need to go interview\nTwo Thirteen and fourteen year olds and see you know what they like and dislike about the program Gary ... won't do it to scare as we're we're not we're not the target audience for Snapchat eh we're not the target audience for Instagram I there's clearly some people that are passionate about it or we're just not one of them and\nClearly there are less people that are passionate about it than there were last quarter\n... man hell on fleet\nWhich is actually a word that kids use now sold I'm just saying like this is what the cool kids are saying now in and I happen to know what it is your hip you hit with the kids are you I'm I'm I'm not that happened but I'm I'm I'm On a week\nYou know harm among All right let's talk a little bit about uh the plan that the president is proposing try to lower Medicare drug costs wouldn't what are we seeing here Mike what we've been talking about this since President Trump took office and it looks like he's putting together a plan the idea behind\nThat is that right now the United states most people I think are recognized as the United states on average\nPays considerably more for prescription drugs than the rest of the world as the rest of the world specifically Europe puts a very specific price controls a on drug makers if they want to sell their drugs in their countries\nAnd therefore the United states and that ends up paying a lot more and end up driving a lot of the research and development that gets done on these the idea here\nIs that President Trump is proposing a plan where they would create an index of\nInternational costs for drug prices and then Medicare will be required to negotiate down to that price so two things could happen here either the drug companies would have to raise prices and the foreign countries to get that index price hire you ask that they could charge more in the United states or more likely\nUnited States prices come down a little bit and international prices go up a little bit to offset that\nThis isn't it is this plant being posed on every drug that's out there it is\nNot there is an especially it just seems like a little bit of a beta testing so they're going to do it for just a few different prescriptions that Medicare has\nUm certain drugs made by a single manufacturing those noted biologics or those made from living organisms and it's gonna be going from twenty twenty to twenty twenty five is where they're going to be experimenting on this um\nIt seemed to be a worthwhile seems very worthwhile endeavor I mean one of the biggest complaints that I have is Medicare basically can't negotiate a pricing no that that's built into their rules for well really because that was the only way they could get the Affordable CARE Act passed through all the money that the pharmaceuticals ran against so\nThis is a big issue I don't know if this will solve the issue but it seems on the surface like it would be a worthwhile endeavor the drug industry by the way going to be fighting this vehemently that there's gonna be a lot of money spent on getting Congress to shut this down\nGoing back to social media also well we saw Twitter report or their earnings are late yesterday they are taking the opposite path of Snapchat they're up over ... over fifty percent in a in their trading what did analysts about Twitter compared with Snapchat\nI'm so first off they're not losing users they are seeing a little bit of a slow down and the growth of users but that is okay because they're not actually losing any they're just not growing aspect\nI was given away all these games by the way all of them have been given a you know not all of them but no but I mean the entire amongst them back to me as though they're given back a little bit today\nUm their third quarter revenue climb twenty nine percent what analysts liked about this as they are really pushing ads and pushing ... their monetize their customers which they haven't done to date in one of\nThe big things they did continue to see you know there's declining users as they think that some of the fake accounts that have been on Twitter\nMy point is look if if they were victims to begin with doesn't really matter what the overall using the rise that I'd like to read the daily active users Twitter it's it's really tough there just because they have such a big fake user problem\nYou know it's a three minute message that I Know I just tell me pick up now everyone acts good everyone's grade I going to get attacked by anyways the U.S and China haven't\nReally heard of people on trade talks in the last couple of weeks here any sense that things are moving behind the scenes or still kind of some hang ups to just getting to the table\nAnd less they are being incredibly sneaky about it it seems like things are just completely stalled out right now are there is the hope to have a meeting scheduled right now for the end of November at the G ... summit\nI'm looking potentially unlikely that that even happens the the us is basically refused to resume and then go ... until Beijing comes out with a proposal to Washington that addresses the complaints about forced technology transfer and quote other economic issues\nI Believe there's a whole list of some hundred and sixty seven hundred and forty two separate demands at the U.S has put in\nAnd um China's just hesitant to put out anything from ... to be fair one I think we're probably taking the right tactic here which is just don't even begin negotiations until they come up and give you something\nUm but China on the other hand is saying if we put out anything than we are fears is going to get linked to the press and then we're going to come from a week and go she ate and point\nBy the way some some data on you know how companies are mentioning in responding to tears this is according to Bloomberg uh in the course over the course of twenty eight team the number of companies that are mentioning tariffs are the number of transcripts that have mentioned them over the course of the year so far\nTwenty one hundred and eighty eight if you go back to last year we didn't get above seven hundred even listen ... you're talking you're three times as much activity on the side as last\nYear do you feel like it's just being used as an excuse for companies know now you think it's made us you\nKnow I I I again just from talking to people in the construction industry and what's happened to prices on that side for steel and aluminum yeah it it's it's a real issue there um as far as you know can can you get projects done at certain prices\nUm and that's just in one industry there's definitely some businesses that are using it as an excuse you know I I always hate when companies you know use you know oh we had bad weather and so like we write like\nGrow up ... happens cheesecake factory don't blame you are terrible sales on bad weather here\nImprove your product improve your product but you know damn good things like this real like you know whether I sit there and go look there's always whether they're always hurricanes there's always snow yep you figure out how to deal with it OK stuff like this these kinds of things have there aren't always terrorists that are coming into effect right so these are things that I Do think have a more meaningful ...\nWhere would you put if you're a gay man where would you put the likelihood the odds of anything getting done on trade with China like a concrete plan before and then this year twelve percent cut them down they're\nVery very and not Thirteen not eleven but those weren't on but that's OK twelve percent I don't understand odds what I wanted I'd had you know a different story ab ... the big beer maker or they make Budweiser that they make just about every ... uh yeah I'm\nJust so they are struggling and they actually cut their dividend in half\nYeah they're not strong I mean when you got your ... and half that's a pretty big message or sending\nSo here's the thing they bought SAP Miller when was it two years ago maybe three three three years ago the exact wrong time to\n... uh you know as awful climbing\nThe exact wrong time to make that deal and they're paying for it now why they're cutting their dividends they took on so much debt to make that deal and consumers taste of changed\nYou know I I think back to three years ago and you know I already thought that at that point the craft beer market was you know really getting crazy and wild and sort of peaking and it has gotten so much bigger since that three year ago and they just continue to take market share away from Budweiser\nAnd I'll tell you the latest ads where they are pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers or are they have you seen these now\nIt's the ones where they've got the guys you know the ... and you go into a ... for everyone at someone's going oh do you mean yeah but they're they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers yeah ... ... there's not a good way to get people to come back to what product\nBut I mean the Bud Light can make fun of the craft drinkers all they want but then on the other side of it they're coming out with these Budweiser products you know a Budweiser freedom reserve red blogger\nIs one of them and they came out recently and the grade bottles and whatever and then the army and yet I'm In Maryland barrel I mean so their knowledge and the fact that they need to change it up and be more creative with their beer not working no it's not it's it's ... you can make fun of it and then do the same thing the other side of it you can have it both ways\nConsumer see through that stuff these days and so a be in the stock\nHas gone from a hundred and twelve down to Seventy three it's fifty percent this year thirty percent this year [noise] you know it's a big dip in a pretty short period of time this stock if you go back to two years to the end of September and twenty sixteen was one thirty a share switch off almost fifty percent in a span of two years\nAnd it by the way it's not just um you know just people saying I Want to craft beer over a Budweiser there's also a big big trend towards liquor and wind that or did not exist in previous generations spirits are on the up\nEnough spirits big time wind to a lesser degree but spirits are very much so much more demand for that type of specific alcohol than ah than beer at\nThe thing that's missing with Budweiser is that these breweries have become a destination and hang out in a ... a day trip for most people our age\nThey got they got no experience from Budd while you go to any of these crap once they got food trucks there they might have local art is a good ... and stuff\nIs they be end up doing anything to get into the marijuana industry you know you see constellation brands are really making some strides there I haven't really heard of a be doing anything\nHaving heard a ton doesn't mean they're not working you know kind of in the background and maybe have say I'm coming but I haven't heard a whole lot there\nNeither [noise] well that is all the time we have on this hour the Dow continues to struggle S. and P. and negative territory now in correction territory off more than ten percent from its high so time we have on this hour we'll be back in just a little bit with more

this when they first started back a couple of weeks ago you know a lot of people were ... kind of similar myself included I remarked a this feels kind of similar to what we saw earlier this year\nSince then I I've kind of moved off that 'cause we've got an economic data that suggests hey we've got you know real slow down the housing that's coming this force this third quarter GDP report had some questions where do you stand as far as not necessarily how bad this could get because again we're not trying to make predictions year 'cause neither of us know\nWhat do you get the sense this thing is a quick dip like we saw in the spring or do you get to get the census might linger a little bit even if you don't know exactly where it goes you\nKnow I still draw a lot of correlations back to what we saw in February and I like you don't make myself in the business of productions but\nI can see a few instances where you could see a rally of this coming back rather quickly if you if you get the midterms behind you and all of a sudden you see a very strong consumer spending towards the end of the year\nTo me that would be an indication that things are gonna recover rather quickly or but it could go the other way to hey I I hate to jump in here and try and lay claim is aware I think the stock market's going to go\nOver the next sixty days because nobody knows\nKnown and and I think the the big thing isn't so much trying to say hey here's where it's going to go but hey what what's important to watch and I booked\nHey anything housing related ... you have to be watching that because that's one of the concerns right now the focus on housing\nFocus on some of the big you know kind of existential questions what's going on with trade negotiations going on in Europe with\nUh the Italian government and their ability to get a budget passed you know those are the things that you need to be asking yourself hey what kind of progress are we seeing and I think when you start to get some of those answers we can get more clarity but for now if it's tough to find a path to a quick bounce back from me but it said any of these things resolved themselves and you might see that'd be the impetus\nAnd by the way you know I Know a lot of people looking at elections and saying oh that is going to be a huge thing that tips the markets one way or the other I Would really discouraged you to put it putting too much stock into politics and how they impact the stock market because if you look at history hasn't matter one bit who wins the midterms and how the stock market reacts not one bit\nExpedia trying to make some moves into air B. and B. used turf what are they talking about doing here among\nOthers a couple of companies that they have recently acquired and they're specifically that they do pretty much the same thing as they're being be but what they try and do is have a better relationship with the people that actually own the places that are getting rent it out so one of the big issues that they identified as people that are [noise]\nYou know leasing an apartment and then sub letting it out on air being bay and that that creates issues for the owners they don't want that it can create issues for the if it's a condo association there can be rules against that sort of thing so what this service does is there one company called pillow in one called apartment jet where\nThey specifically contract with both the lease holder as well as the owner of the unit to make sure that you know the owner knows who's going to be in the apartment and a number of different factors to make it just a little bit more secure in the way they're renting this out\nDo you think this makes one one of the questions that I've raised with regards to air being be is you're seeing ... he's pushing back on either setting limits are saying hey you can't do this do you think this helps the square away some of those problems and maybe make this a more\nUm you know not favorable but I guess a more\nReasonable landscape for companies similar to ... to operate in\nYeah and to be fair to air BNB they've taken some pretty big moves to make things a little bit safer and make things more [noise]\nI guess a compliance with local jurisdictions in terms of you know collecting collecting taxes and things along those nature that they weren't doing initially so I think

little battle going on a Campbell Soup company right now a third point else the damn lobes hedge fund a is trying to replace the entire twelve person boarded Campbell Soup not just add a board seat or pick up a couple here and there they want to replace the entire twelve person board\nFirst question is why second question is what's going on\nWell they're alleging that Campbell's you failed to

company\nUh and that's probably a third points you know idea here I think that this could be a pretty good and easy sale to a company like craft times\nOkay something along those lines\nYeah I mean I'm not saying that that's what's gonna happen but it would seem like it would pretty easily fit into that business model\nI Will say you know look I'm I'm not a big Campbell Soup fan in general but there's something about the tomato soup on a on a cold winters day with the little grilled cheese dipped in it that it it it's there's just something right about a grilled cheese and tomato soup very
