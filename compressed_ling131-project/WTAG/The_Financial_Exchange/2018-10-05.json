the national correspondent good morning Bill Bill I Want to get into something a before we get to regular stuff a danger on Capitol Hill so all Capitol Hill police are being told cancel your vacation to this do that every halls got police in them\nAnd we have serious threats against US Senators right now tell me about this\nIs a really starting to get out of hand ah the the extent to where people are going to try to influence\nInfluenced the votes of Santa Fe and uh people are getting in everybody faces now are there has been a ... the wife of Rand Paul is coming up and calling out Cory Booker thing he's responsible\nFor causing some of this mayhem as well but yeah the death threats are ranging from I mean we heard in the cabinet situation we had heard about threats directed it kept it on as late as well as Dr Ford and and now individuals senators as well\nOr is this is really getting to a point where you have to wonder whether this is going to lay down the road the total anarchy or whatever but\nAh it's ridiculous to get to this point and the fact that the individual senators now have this hanging over\nWe saw Mitch McConnell you know like uh what's his nickname the turtle I mean come on get you to give them any more Meek of a guy and he's got this woman just been raining him as he tries to watch or Reagan National to get to a flight and it's everywhere else though it's in the Capitol building it's every where else route\nI I Am just concerned like you\nThat you get this kind of anger and emotion the next step is violence\nWell absolutely and that we've seen constant protests around the capital we've seen those protests people blocking always walking senators off and things like that hopefully it doesn't escalate past that brought a once you get to making threats like here like him as a matter of time before it followed up with action\nThey do I want to try gasoline with you on the time that we have remaining okay yeah so President Trump is saying hey Saudi Arabia and up the valve and meanwhile the the United Nations top court is telling\nThe United states have backed off of Iraq and you've warned us that you know when these sanctions really go into place down their oil stops flowing ... are going to go up and that and that's not too far off\nWell it's not a one month from today when those sanctions are due to go into effect on Iranian oil exports and as a matter of fact the orders that started going down now has other country prepared for the sanctions that go into effect so this court ruling\nNeither states okay you gotta if some of the sanctions but uh but it's nowhere to can enforce that show the United states will basically ignored and Iran had a argue that that was in violation of the Nineteen fifty five creating so the first thing the U.S yesterday was nominate that pretty so\nWe again are are kind of make them stand against Iran and the sanctions are going to stay in effect so yeah we're telling Saudi Arabia you got to Jack up the production\n... and the original child play you can also catch a new season from years of Fox's animated shows like Bob's Burgers Family Guy Tana Simpsons now when it's thirty is the

I mean people say people they can I drink around you you can drink around me the uh the small government here to me the small government aspect of this which is important\nIs the reason why you have all these great beers now and all these great Mike rivers is because forever\nThe U.S government restricted or breweries from opening up you couldn't ... you couldn't do all these things the government was in everybody's face we obviously know about the amendment prohibition situation but this was that they really did restrict is for a long time and they they kept the you know innovation

Kevin Republican Senator Chuck Grassley moons ago though this morning's voters procedural to set up tomorrow's final up or down vote for Brett Kavanaugh but Democrat Dianne Feinstein just said two minutes ago Kavanaugh last week searing was\nAnd you know it it's just a quarter but hey look if we see another one of those you know the than the horses\nYou know officially left the barn mhm\nThis is the kind of thing that does start to make you a little bit concerned hey is the fed going to be you know we were hiking more than expected and we saw this somewhat with a bonds this morning we're the ten year treasury initially spiked up to three point to four percent at one point or which was its highest\nAh highest level since uh two thousand eleven yeah do I do think this is something that could put some pressure on the fed if it continues you may see some fed hikes that come through here\nAnd that has the effect of really you know continuing to slow down real estate markets we've seen slowing price growth in them to this point\nBut also you know potentially if you're talking about people who may have taken out adjustable rate mortgages myself included I have an adjustable rate mortgages and people who might have credit card debt people might have adjustable you know there's there's a whole bunch of different areas where you might have adjustable owns out there the costs for those people are going to start moving up as a result of this city\nI I think we ... we all get very concerned about rising interest rates and what the Fed's going to do next and it's important that can be concerned about and it will impact financial markets\nIt's also important to keep it ... keep in mind you know where we are in terms of historical norms and you can still go get a mortgage right now for under four and a half percent\nYou can do not not so much I mean I guess that Thirty years probably averaging right about four and a half your ears or eight right now I'm thirty I'm In a in terms of historical norms we're still pretty low interest rates and I I think that this economy could still absorb\nYou know a little bit higher interest rates at this point I don't think\nYou are in I don't think you're in danger of you know\nIf let's say the fed does hike rates three you know one more time this year and the times last year next year\nI don't think you're in danger of financial meltdown that that'd be pretty par for the course\nKnown it's ... it's not a case where rates necessarily lead to that melt down\nUm but it is a case where they likely do lead to some continued slowing in the U.S the ... and and that's something that when you take into account the overseas picture you sit there and say gee you know it doesn't necessarily paint the prettiest picture looking out twelve to Eighteen months if we take a look at the probability for December rate hike now\nBack before this was announced we go back just a day ago it was about Seventy seven percent chance that we saw a hike\nOr in December we're now up to an eighty six percent chance so you know this is pretty much saying hey look the cake isn't quite baked yet for December and that rate hike\nBut it's getting pretty close this is another strong data point that likely points in that direction and probably you know all but assures us that we're getting that hike in uh in December up to between two and a quarter and two and a half percent that's where a the fed is likely going to be targeting short term rates than\nSay your production had been I Believe for for rate hikes this year and two for next year is that accurate I'm On the one to two next year okay and I'm On team two to three next year it has this report change anything for you\nKnow I'm Still I'm Still thinking that the international stuff is going to be enough that it results in a a slowdown especially some of the data that we got in the last couple of days I've I've harped on the south Korea number just because\nThey are a major manufacturing and exporting center and their exports year over year for August we're down eight point six percent that's that's not a small shift that used to be there the last time we saw numbers like that from South Korea was back in the store to twenty sixteen when you had the energy sector completely falling apart\nLet's play this example of out a little bit for that I don't mean to get too deep into hypothetical but let's say that we do see three rate hikes next year and a you know by the time December twenty Nineteen rolls around\nLet's imagine that us interest rates are significantly higher than other developed market interest rates will they already are keep in mind they already are today that but that would you know really inflate things if ah you know the global economy Europe continue to stagnate and us to come to continue to raise interest rates ... what is that due to the global economy what concerns do we have than about\nThe U.S and global economy is and how people behave and the scenario\nWith a big thing that you're already seeing is in emerging markets you're seeing this this effectively dollar shortage that is a creeping up there and what happens there pretty much\nIs ... you effectively have people who ... they're trying to buy dollars because their own currencies are falling\nAnd what it does is it continued it creates a cycle where the dollar strengthens making it more difficult for people who own other currencies to buy it and it really can can create a slowdown in some of these emerging economies um so it's it has some really nasty short term effects there and and that's why when I look at you know one of the things that does concern me\nIt is to a certain extent dollar strength because dollar strength\nYou know makes it so that you have capital flight out of these emerging economies and in today's world you know that does have a very real impact on the overall global trade so sure I look at it and and that's part of the reason why I think the fed is only able to hike one more time next year\nI think another piece there of the puzzle is the overall net interest expense that the U.S is paying this is going to continue the ... into the budget as far as our ability to finance our deficit and pay for other programs\nAre especially since you don't have a lot of international appetite for us bonds right now yeah yeah it's a legitimate concern there's there's some stuff that's out there that I worry about\nUh let's take a quick break here when we come back you know move away from jobs and we're going to start talking\nSpy chips not pita chips not potato chips but we are going to start talking spy chips we didn't covered this yesterday really but the story about apple Amazon and other major

right ah obviously not well a stock is down nearly five percent on the news uh so you know apparently apparently he's proving it right I I guess if you call the SEC the short seller enrichment mission it will become the short seller enrichment commission it's a self fulfilling prophecy their Ilan\nWhat's going on with Cosco I Know they reported earnings ah yesterday they are currently down about two point six percent what what'd you glean from them\nSo I'm sure there's going to be more to come on this eh Cosco report the fourth quarter earnings are right in line to thirty six to share the basically in line with expectations but they said that they expect to report material weakness in their internal controls and\nUh ... what does that mean yeah that's the big question a it could mean a number of things that could mean that\nSome sort of accounting was done incorrectly but they did say that they don't believe that er they they'd been going through things and said they haven't found any incorrectly reported financial statements yet\nUm but material weakness an internal control means to me that\nThere was something wrong with your financial reporting documents we don't know exactly where it is but you don't know where it is they haven't said that they found it so it's possible that there'll be nothing it'll be possible they say you know we found a weakness in our controls but it actually didn't lead to any issues\nIt's also I think more likely that they're going to disclose that there was some sort of corruption that they need to make the prior earnings or something along those lines so we'll see what Cosco comes up with your but obviously that sort of ambiguity not great for the ... you\nKnow it's it's it's not really ideal it's not the kind of thing that you want to see their let's talk a little bit about this report or out of the wall Street Journal auto makers considering moving some more manufacturing or to North America and this was on the heels of\nA affective leave the revised trade agreement likely being approved in a in the U.S Canada and Mexico but we've got representatives from BMW and dime we're at the very least saying hey we're probably gonna have to move more production into these countries which was the exact aim of the Trump Administration in pursuing these kinds of deal\nYeah I mean it shouldn't be surprising area and if you want to avoid a tariff now you need to move more of your manufacturing here in North America so\nThe new tentative deal which has not been put into place yet uh does require automakers to build at least Seventy five percent of cars value within North America that used to be sixty two and a half percent so that's you know up a good was that twelve and a half percent\nAh it also requires that forty to forty five percent the vehicle is made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour or so that\nYou know limits you uh that that does limit you in terms of where you can be putting these cars and assembling them or what are we going to workers for this uh\n... it might actually be that you see the net effect this might just be that you know U.S companies have already invested billions of dollars in New Mexico plants they might just raise the new raise the wages to those to those workers there rather than relocating some of these jobs will have to say\nLet's talk about a

it's not that you know northern Minnesotans are walking around with you know Kansas Bud Light you know force feeding them to birds or anything like that but\nIt didn't seem like something you'd have to pay to see and like the Bahamas or something like that\nWill ... will know my my my first thought is this just seems like the kind of thing that is like the the first scene in some kind of apocalyptic movie like nerds losing all sense of direction of flying into windows and stuff like that but what's what's actually happening\nIn your mind the birds are ingesting berries that have fermented apparently earlier than usual because of an early frost in Minnesota\nAh and because of that birds have been flying into cars windows or you know really as you mentioned losing their sense of direction and it's been apparently a bit of a concerning apocalyptic mess in northern Minnesota does drop birds or\nFigure out their lives are smart don't panic or the birds will eventually perhaps

against the Yankees are we were just taking a look at tickets by the way it looks like he can still get tickets for about a hundred bucks and then going up from there [laughter]\nBut um you know Brad we had you on I think back in February talking to us about the impact of the super bowl a and it seemed like he was pretty muted in terms of uh you know most cities saying hey we're going to be throwing parties at home and you know restaurant sales not really seeing much of an increase how does that compare to playoff series in the end all be\nSure a it's a very different actually we see a pretty significant increase in a number of business categories but just to kind of recap how we do this a wobbly we\nCarry transaction data from millions of small businesses powers of software that are small businesses use but it also gives us an interesting look into all these patterns that are going on in local market in different states around transactions between consumers and small businesses and those that either so for example\nWe can look at last year's performance or four different business categories\nIn towns where I'm a ... where there is a major league team in the playoffs in the what the impact is so what we did is our data science team normalized\nOr what the average day for revenue looked like in the three months prior to the playoffs and then compared\n... the timeframe during the playoffs against that average and what we found was that there was a pretty significant change across the board so ah just looking at a a game day versus non game day on game days all these categories that we analyzed ... thirty two percent increase in sales\nOn non game days even they saw twenty five percent increase\nAnd then home in a way there wasn't a huge difference out of a across the businesses that we analyzed and the difference that either one of the last last year was thirty two percent versus a whether they were home our way but there are some significant difference as we look at when you look at specific markets like Boston or New York I'm On those different dimensions\nBred guinea talk a little bit about those a specific differences there\nSo let's take Boston for example so ah there is a major difference in the home versus away average there so again I mentioned at the home or if you look at just when the team is the home how to restaurants and bars and lounges lodging businesses and transportation business as fair\nI'm On average a across all this city has thirty two percent increase its Seventy six percent increase in Boston and when there are when the team to the way you still use the uh a bump in those businesses though it's sixty seven percent in Boston\nAnd then again looking at the difference between a game day when the red Sox are playing versus the day when they're not playing during playoff season\nUm there's seven point spread a in that game day versus non gain day across all cities but in Boston it's much larger it's almost dot twenty five percent so Seventy two percent list on game day forty six percent lift on non game day so in general\nPeople are responding to the fact that the team is in the playoffs and actually getting out of the house and spending money with these businesses on on a much higher level than across other cities\nBrother you just looking at these ... metro areas as a whole or do you even get you know kind of neighborhood specific in this data\nSo it it's difficult to get really specific because the sample sizes becomes smaller we ... tens of thousands of businesses across all of these cities but obviously we want to maintain a high bar for\nUm you know the the repeat ability of the data so and the funny that we're finding so in some cases there may be a like a code that has a high concentration of businesses but for this purpose we really just looked at this on a high level we also have to constrain the against\nYou know are these businesses that are are trends acting daily making sure that it's not you know sort of a business it's open only you know two or three days a week that kind of thing\n[noise] very good bread we've got to run but thanks for joining us today thank you guys spreadsheet lost out from wobbly talking about the financial impact of the major league baseball playoffs on the news that the teams are in we've only got about ten seconds left\nSo let's talk a little bit about those playoffs he got Matt Dr Yankees\nWho Red Sox\nOkay we've got the red Sox Mike oh come on like this isn't even a reasonable ... who who you got the Sox got\nSocks and five [noise]\nI'm going section five is well it's all the time we have on this hour we'll be back in just a little bit with a whole lot more financial exchange\n[laughter] station [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts Brett Kavanaugh clear is his first hurdle is the Senate's I'm Dave Anthony\nBut we're having one of the largest trucker shortage in our national history we ever having a very difficult time finding people to fill these jobs I think there's a fifty thousand driver trucker shortage the average age now for a trucker\nIs Seventy six thousand dollars maybe a\nSeventy three thousand dollars and\nYou've seen wages going up in that area from eight to twelve percent per year my question is are we just finding a different way to ship these goods or is there truly a decline coming in terms of the number of orders and the number of shipments that we're seeing across the country\nI think that when we look at some of the other day to the ... that it is out there and I hate to keep going back to the south Korea number but we had a number from South Korea last month exports declined eight point six percent year over year if that matches up pretty closely with this decline in truck orders okay and so I look there and I say\nLook there is absolutely a trucker shortage that is going on right now the probably leads to a lot of you know companies saying\nHey why are we going to order ... which sits around with no\nI ... that makes sense or well to some whatever\nAnyways what I'm trying to get at is what you absolutely have a trucker shortages probably affecting this but I also think there is a plot totaling that's going on right now just because of that one time stimulus of effect of tax reform starting to wear wear off a little bit and I do think\nAh that you have some international pressures that reducing the amount of commerce that's being done overall\nSo we've been talking about a bunch of barricades scenarios talk about a bowl if you're going to be bullish on this economy up what is going to grow earnings for ... for companies over the next let's call it three years and then we've got tax reform behind us what\nIs going to change whether it be political policy whether it be can you know consumer behavior what's going to change to make this US Economy continue to burn on all cylinders\nIf you look at the two biggest things that would have a stimulus of effect over the next twelve months number one is getting trade deals hammered out with all these other countries not just you know redoing NAFTA so getting that squared away just so you don't have an certainly from a supply chain perspective number two\nInfrastructure projects okay get infrastructure projects going figure out ways to get that money you know deployed and so forth we're going to have trouble getting enough workers there so it might even be something where we say look we need to come up with temporary visa programs in order to get workers in for\nThese infrastructure projects because we know we don't have enough construction workers today will never happen I'm not you asked me to ... yep you asked me the ball ... I did okay so that's if you want the most bullish case that you can have\nGet all these trade issues behind us figure out ways to get infrastructure don't gets more people into the workforce in the short term\nThat's how you keep this party going for the next two to three years that's that's the ... so there's a pat there it's tough okay 'cause I don't see the issue with China going away anytime soon but I don't see us coming up with any ... any kind of big infrastructure plan\nThat actually can get through Congress anytime soon so\nThe bookcase I think it's it's tougher to stretch that out more than twelve to Eighteen months I think we still have at least another year or two to three quarters of the minimum left here before this thing starts to get a little bit dicey but look I'll be honest if you continue to see wage growth like this\nThat's going to stretch this thing out even more just because the concern is look if you don't have wage growth how do people spend they can only borrow so much if you have wage growth that question goes away\nYeah I was gonna say the barricades here and you know it might not be great for the stock market you know as you see of slow down an earnings that might not be Griffith stock market but it's probably not that bad of a case for the average American workers because I don't think unemployment's about to shoot up and I don't think that wage growth is about to stagnate\nDepends what causes it you know if it if it's caused by just a shortage of workers and things like that yeah you can you can figure that out eventually if these trade issues blow up and continue to get worse than then you've got some concerns because they've got supply issues and when you have supplies shoes you got prices going up not because you don't have\nA demand for stuff you have no problems actually getting stuff to people and it's you know we've gone through that with oil shortage is back in the seventies ... we've we've talked about this kind of stuff before if not pretty if you see that so all of this does bring us to our poll question\nIt does and our poll question of the day is up right now it's up on financial exchange show dot com you can go over there and vote in our poll question is have you received more than a three percent raise in the last year we say this or we ask that simply because we were talking about wage growth now we're finally seeing it in\nThe early results thirty two percent of our listeners have received more than a third or more than three percent raise over the last year sixty eight percent of listeners received less than a three per cent raise\nAnd by the way we want to know so a respond to the poll but if you are someone that has or has not received\nA a raise in the last few years or the last year Texas Texas it's six three five six six and tell us what industry do you work in where we're we're looking for some trends year I don't think we've quite seen any real big trends in terms of what
