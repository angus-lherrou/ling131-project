bonding\nAnd don't want to give it to other people and use the government and the power that they have other in or outside of government in order to make sure that they keep the stuff that they have stuff and the other people don't\nAh that sounds very that has a mark just playing right that sounds like it's very much about the redistribution of wealth\nAnd I think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself he's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful\nThat's where he knows that's a sweet spot for Democrats envy envy push that push that notion it's it's powerful politics and accused the other side of being cynical ... what is it that Republicans Republicans want to give a little less of their own money\nTo the government there being greedy\n... this is a a at a central talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires okay well they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I mean are the top one percent pace I think thirty percent\nOf all federal income taxes so there we already have a very progressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about you know ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to wherever it is wherever it is every speech he gives same basic theme\nThere are the other guys don't want the government to have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more stuff\nHe creates this perception that prosperity and security and all these things that people strive for and society the zero some one side has it the other side doesn't\nMean what what what are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is you know why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrity good on the list these are people that have amassed incredible fortune\nAll Democrats why are they all Democrats you know what\nWhat I find to be the case is that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous\nStruggle to make their money\nUh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative\nPeople that when the genetics lottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people or people who get really really lucky with you know signing onto a start up early on in Silicon valley you know being a contempt guy in the door and now their options are worth a billion dollars and\nThey tend to be liberal I you know this is just that anecdotal but that's my sense of it if you had to sweat it out risk\nMany night's sleep a you know do your own taxes take out your own trash a cut back on on you know eating out because you're trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nOr concerts I just\nThat's the only way I could explain the difference in the economic philosophy here are but Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful and the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also kept talking about the economy play that play Seventeen [laughter]\nWe're\nPeriod and Republicans\nFor the rich [noise] they've\nBank [noise] and\nFinancial crisis in our life [noise] and Democrats [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell why did it start with Obama how how about\nWe've had even we had an even bigger\nFinancial pull back with the great depression and we recovered from that and ... and enter period of huge economic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years in the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow ... remind her by the way Obama never achieved or three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never\nOnly president in history for whom that's the case so when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous that what he's saying is is transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the\nGovernment was the problem with\nWhat happened in the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this\nYou know when he says degree banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was a liberal said that banks to lend to people who can't pay it back\nBut if you can't pay it back and you happen to be non privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories then banks to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a long\nAnd you do that enough and the federal government backstop those loans and\nSays well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we we've got you got you covered Wall Street\nAnd Wall Street does what it does that's what really happened I mean you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather\nBy someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy ... what exactly does does he think got and it was a ... girl they're caught him to go go go gotta going how what exactly did he do\nAnd I think the truth is it's very clear he he has absolutely no answer I mean the stimulus was was atrocious Simmons was a huge waste of money and that was money that was just put on the tab for future generations to pay\nSo what ... what did Obama brings to the table when it came to get an economy of running answers he doesn't even have an answer he's just out there just all demagoguery it's all so shallow but really that's a good summary of what we had for eight years of Obama\nTo all the business owners age are folks anyone who's hiring anybody across the country you got to make sure that the person who is doing or background checks knows what they're doing and can get you answers fast and make sure

it\nThat free speech does not include ... the prophet of Islam that is right free speech\nIs no longer inclusive of saying stuff about\nThe prophet Mohammed and others so have you get mad at me when I said the prophet Mohammed I'm not saying it's my profit but we need some way to designate who this guy is because\nYou may be a very aware of this back a lot of Mohammed running around I don't think it's not just say Mohammed you know ... maybe even figure it out of context but people say the prophet Mohammed because\nYou know then we all know we are talking about but it's now a not considered free speech to say anything mean about the prophet Muhammad and\nYou know you can say oh buck but that Europe why does that really matter keep in mind that one of the big arguments that we constantly hear now in this country\nIs that what they're doing in Europe we should replicate here when it comes to economics when it comes specifically to healthcare oh it works in Europe we should do it here Canada has also gone down this path\nCanada's no longer a country where you can a reliably speak on issues that deal with Islam and radical Islam ... radicalism and\nThey also have the and then never mind also the gender male female issue which is really large professor Peterson's career by the way was that he was one who said I like I'm not going to play this game of calling people the as a function of law that just strikes me as\nAs as bizarre and and he was right it was bizarre but here you have the European Court of human rights by the way this is the\nUm this is the case that got this um uh\nSome attention quote the European Court of human rights rule Austrian courts had carefully balance or or the writer freedom of an Austrian woman who called Mohammed a pedophile due to his marriage to a six year old girl\nOr the woman in her late forties and identified only as E S claim during two public sentiment seminars in two thousand other moms marriage to a young girl was quote I can do pedophilia\nAccording to Islamic tradition the marriage between Mohammed and a six year old girl was consummate when she was nine and he was about fifty\nShow here we have a faith tradition that his practice by one point seven billion people and the founder of this face a profit who\nFor believers and I'm not one so I Do not believe this obviously but for believers of was dictated by the angel Gabriel or a or a new holy book that really is meant to overtake all the previous holy books are but it's also accepted\nThat he had a a a relationship a sexual relationship ... when he was fifty when he was a middle aged man with a child\nThat that's I mean that's just to save the facts and this woman was convicted for saying this she was convicted of disparaging religious doctrines had to pay five hundred and forty seven dollar fine so this has now been upheld or the European Court of human rights says that this is the serves the legitimate\nAim of quote preserving religious piece let me have a few words to say about this um okay\nIf we see this ground that we are no longer allowed to say things that are offensive to people especially offensive to people who artist special protected class because of their religion their skin color of their ethnicity their nationality if we see that ground or we will increasingly find that that is just the beginning\nOf much a much\nMore widespread speech restrictions and we used to understand this we used to understand this is a country I think increasingly we are\nNot just losing sight of it but also being force fed the opposite there's a canary in the coal mine affect your with you and with Canada and with free speech\nWe should pay very close attention to it\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest

make the hack need avocado toast joke a this is where you get to talk about safe spaces and pajama boy at all that stuff\nOr this was in that this was in the daily\nWire with the earlier this

incredibly serious obviously the DSD is something that if you have for real reasons as a deserving of the most serious treatment and and assistance and helping and sympathy\nBut they got beat DSD because of the election that's right they are so psychologically traumatized because Trump won the twenty sixteen election that they are now considering themselves to be\nOfficially a officially suffering from\nTraumatic stress syndrome to a clinically significant level\nA clinically sniffing level so you know this this is what I Would say goes into the pile of evidence that I'm building up\nAnd maybe we'll have to do a book or a project on this about how the left really has lost his mind I don't mean that as in oh I'm I'm trying to be funny about them or I'm I'm doing the usual\nAnd

answer on the air and hopefully his answer will stop you from being one of his next\nReal life stories tub when we talk about funding the trust we are talking about actually\nTransferring the ownership and transferring the assets into the name of your ... great great question which is feels kind of life for a lot of people giving your assets away so if you were to give your assets away whether it's to another person or an eerie vocal trust do you have to pay gift tax when that happens\nSo ... is the first question if you're given outright to the kids\nIs that what you're asking if you give it outright or if I get older they rushed to want to know at all so if we give it to the children and we want to compare the two giving it to the children will in fact result in a completed gift for gift tax purposes and so yes\nYou would have to fill out a form seven o nine or ... or ... do the same time your income tax return is do every year or so in April\nAnd the seven o nine would be acknowledging that you made let's say a hundred thousand dollar gift to the kids of a portfolio or five hundred thousand dollar home if you gave away your home\nYou know less the Fifteen thousand dollar president interest exclusion that you're allowed to give away so that's the freebie gas that's the freebie file anything don't even need to file if that's all you were giving away but because this gift exceeded that amount\nYou would file it reduced by the amount of the president interest exclusion the Fifteen thousand dollar freebie\nThe amount over that would be considered\nThe taxable gift and so if it was you know a hundred thousand dollars MINUSTAH Fifteen you have an eighty five thousand dollar taxable gift yes\nDoesn't mean you're going to pay tax because you are going to eat into your eleven million one hundred and eighty thousand dollar once in a lifetime gift tax exemption ... by the eighty five grand\nThat doesn't hurt as much but in Massachusetts and depending on your state even though there is no state a state tax mhm oh I'm Sorry no state gift tax yeah you do have to reduce your estate tax exemption\nSo if you only had a million dollar exemption and you ate into it by eighty five thousand dollars well now you are under a million and if you gave away a five hundred thousand dollar home let's make it a real gift you now have five hundred thousand dollars left of your exemption and a lot not helpful\nYeah the taxes and a lot of people don't realize when they say oh I don't need the attorney I'm just going to put the house in my kid's name that\nThe gift that is a gift and we're not even talking about all the other negatives and loss of control and things that go with putting the house in the kid's name ... but the forgetting that you're right it's a gift\nAnd it's a taxable gift and it really does impact the estate tax calculation going forward right for the person who made the gift not the recipient mhm the recipients folks has no income tax or gift tax liability OK okay ... go\nAhead and how does that all differ if you transfer assets into a trust you still need to do that same tax form the form seven and nine and so forth\nYou know and that's a beautiful thing about these irrevocably trust everybody says things are so you know rigid inflexible and scary scary word that every local I've given it away and all this\nI tell people right in the beginning when you set up these irrevocably trust they are in complete gifts for gift tax purposes you are not giving anything to the children mhm you are not giving anything to the trustee\nYou are simply putting it in the trust the trust would own it\nBut for gift tax purposes it's an incomplete gift because you as the creator of the trust have retained and you've heard of spoke speak about this before\nA limited power of appointment which means you have the right as the donor or to a point the assets to charity mhm well because you could appoint him to charity\nAll during your life we don't really know who the gift would have been made to right that's what makes it an incomplete gift he can change your mind you can change your mind so therefore no seven or nine gift tax return really needs to be filed and there is no gift tax\nLiability and not only that but there are benefits to giving your assets to transfer and your assets into an area vocal trust\nVersus just giving way to your kids from a capital gains tax shore active so you you may be unnecessarily creating a tax for your kids were none what exists that's exactly right just kept it in your trust or even in your own name that you're doing that from a tax perspective\nAnd and also the creditor issue yeah or you don't own it anymore I mean this is a whenever I clients tell me well why don't we just put it in their name I'm like I won't do it yeah you need another lawyer because I'm not going to have my client give up the ownership rights to their home\nThey need to feel comfortable that they can live there the rest of their life they need to feel comfortable they can sell and downsizing and you moved to another state and and not be impacted by adverse gift or capital gains tax consequences we\nDon't like it pay in taxes let alone unnecessary taxes folks if you have been thinking about creating an ear evoke will trust but you're really not sure where to start\nStart by educating yourself

financial advisor with the Armstrong advisory group will be back and just a few minutes on the legal exchange with Todd let ski\nTime now for Wall Street we can move you look back at the market performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong make\nThe American jobless rate is at the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine in the unemployment rate is at all time lows do you think the labor market has reached unsustainable levels at this point\nI mean the labor market is just like all other markets you know when employees are readily available employers can pay less for workers and when unemployment is low like today employers are forced to compete for workers often through wage increases when workers become scarce employers have to attract workers with wage increases and benefits\nAnd while there is an upper limit to the number of people that can have jobs without ruining it for\nEveryone else there's still significant room for growth\nFor those looking to be fully employed despite this low unemployment rate you know one indicator of this is the inflation adjusted compensation per hour\nWhich has only grown by four percent since two thousand seven you know in addition average hourly earnings and dollars has been very little gross suggesting that inflation is not yet a threat to the labor market\nSo when you say that there's still room to grow

phrased is that\nShe doesn't want to just inherit her daughter I Would assume so she just wants to make sure that the son\nWho doesn't have a place to live it sounds like the daughter does right or can can live in the house so let's make some assumptions so let's assume we don't want to just inherit anybody 'cause most people don't\nAnd let's expand this a little bit because I see a lot of problems here in addition to this one you talk about our ... and it is I think is one of the most important things to mention a and I know we're discussing in the material\nThe ability to change your mind yeah right if this had been given away to the kids\nAnd reserved a life a state and that's all and now later on\nWhen she wanted to just take care of the sun\nNot not as guaranteed you can't do
