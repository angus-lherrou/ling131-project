[noise] um\nThings Kavanaugh's a gang serial rapist\nOr cereal gang rapist I guess would be would make more sense by let's get to pot here everybody's favorite subject why can't and this is a good question posed in mass live why can't Massachusetts Medical marijuana labs\nAlso test recreational pot I'm gonna I'm gonna put it to the to the gentleman here so we're already selling recreational I mean a medical marijuana it obviously has to be tested to make sure there's no chemicals in it\nFor its potency all that stuff so it goes to a lab and then it can be sold in the medical marijuana dispensaries but you can't sell pot\nIn the\nRecreational stores yet\nNow why can't we just use the medical labs Danny\nI don't know the answer to this I don't know if you do either but is the medical marijuana or more strictly tested then the\nRecreational marijuana maybe is this are in a threshold that they have to either reach or not read sure and I think with the medical marijuana they have to be a lot more\nThe documentation on the packaging and stuff like that has to be there where I'm not sure it has to be there for recreational so then the answer then becomes why can't the testing facilities do both yeah I guess that because the answer might be is\nHow much medical marijuana or they testing can keep up with what they have now I mean you're making incredible logical sense I did hear John Bay back\nI'm a signal that he wants to ah try to try and try to solve the puzzle and I bet I bet he as the answer because I Am the answer and I'm sure John does John explain to people why a medical marijuana facility can't test pot for recreational facility\nWell I've always been led to believe that the standards of purity among the two products is substantially different\nAnd so you would not want to mix the the protocols out one facility for the for the purpose of for for the issue that may develop that you may mix things up and and contamination\n... acts again an excellent answer but not incorrect\nNo no it's it's very logical John it's your answer made a lot of sense be an easy answer made a lot of sense the bee or would you be willing you are the skeptic of the group Steve [laughter] no no no really Danny is but would you be willing to wage or a gas\nYeah it's because uh the the the state of Massachusetts who wants to throw as much red tape and possibly can and so here they are doing what they do bad which is slow everything down to a crawl\nYou know what the ... I'll tell you what\nSteve came the closest to the correct answer here is the correct answer no I'm I Know John here is the correct answer medical marijuana\nIs regulated\nUnder the department of public health\nSo the department of public health regulates the labs that will test the medical marijuana\nRecreational marijuana comes from the cannabis control commission\nIn their labs will test\nMe the pot to be produced for commercial or recreational use not medical I'm not kidding that's the only difference they're going to test it for the same thing they're going to check it out in the same way\nSteve came the closest to the correct answer its bureaucracy when I was on\nConnecting point last friday night I should put up a link to the to the show because the the show is archived now and you can watch it we talk about medical marijuana are we talking about recreational marijuana why we don't have a lesser and in North Hampton\nOr a recreational pot shops open\nAnd it's because of this and supposedly the commission is going to meet very very soon and get this all straightened out but might play sons from the Republican en masse live you got to the bottom of the story\nHe didn't say it like we did but its bureaucracy\nIt's ridiculous it's insane\nThey just\nLook the cat's\nOut of the bag no matter how you feel about pot or whatever it is here okay yes I Know there's new studies out suggesting that if you use marijuana before your brain is fully develop you're going to you you're so much higher risk\nFor psychiatric ... a ... is shoes later in life yes and get all of that\nUm but it's full steam ahead on this and I my opinion is once you're full steam at on something like this just do it\nBut the revenue that we all expected [noise]\nI mean really the revenue that we all expected from this stuff okay there's some from medical the revenue we all expect it from from this stuff we said let's let's casts are a lot less have gambling let's have medical marijuana will make a lot of money off of it the only they only folks sending any money\nInto the state coffers is MGM in Springfield that's it\nThat's it\nWe can't get out of our own way can you can you picture a business\nI'm your own company where you work now I Know we we all make complaints about our employer and we say you know they should do this like this a bit just listen to us as you do this like this okay I I agree and I do the same thing\nBut for the most part a business makes decisions when it comes to revenue but usually they're on there or not to make upon their on the money but you tell a business hey if you guys get moving and you get this a recreational pot store up and running\nYou're going to make a lot of money is going to be ready you know it's going to be great do you think there'd be\nDragging their feet like the cannabis control commission see can we get a job on that commission here we do nothing commission well I mean I I Know you have to be careful\nAnd and uh watch what you do but I I mean what do you though I mean they legalized the plants and people have a growing in their backyard they're not testing that stuff I mean look it's not like a it it's not like we're talking about some white powdery substance where you could put God Knows what into it\nI'm ... I don't know you grow the things that comes on it like it's like ... I Would think you'd test at the same way you test green beans down and stop and shop [laughter] [noise]\nI mean it can be a valid point do you think about it any stopping more of a testing green beans okay All right well one of the things about green beans or their pesticides all over these green beans or the you know I mean you have to check for that\nSpray in may so we're going to go to jail at all certain names I mean at what point are we allowed to ... hours\nYahoo are allowed to to defend yourself today if you are under threat\nAnd you feel that your family and you are in a actual unsafe condition not in college I feel unsafe but in actual ... excuse me\n... let me talk up what may talk stood up and took a protester\nDoubt what game than\nAllowed to have done that I don't mean down like ... I mean you know if he did what he has been in his right to defend his family and his circle or for the elation of violence\nNow did you have a foolish here would have been foolish to do it escalated violence is not a defense against but for no relation of violence that's going to make it worse I mean what Ted Cruz did was when\nRight what if you didn't tell me Ted Cruz lost that they did we lose the cap and I think that we didn't we didn't come out in the streets and and and scream and beat the crap out of people with Kevin ... is he in the Supreme Court we would have lost the capital K yeah you would have lost that you would have lost you would've life certainly what last Jeff Flake he was dying to vote no but we didn't give me the opportunity\nYou went through and handle the situation right now having those on the Supreme Court handled well\nWhat's and what's the next level they're going to go out\nAnd I don't know we'll have to wait and see you seem to want to predict it an act on it now yeah and I'm I'm I'm not with you on that believe me I Will protect my family\nAnd I without my security guards I'm Sorry I might threats are a little bit more than getting dirty looks in the

Michael joining ever closer to the Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony the most powerful storms ever hit that area with one hundred forty five mile an hour sustained wind gusts of one sixty five\nAnd they you know a lot of people who are trying to get capital out of those countries are attracted actually to the rising us interest rates so that's putting pressure on those markets the strength of the dollar is also putting pressure on them because it's on causing reduction in you know those you know countries currencies\nSo you know you're seeing you know the potential for our capital fled for market corrections and for foreign exchange moving across the board which cannot which can lead to the crisis\nThis looks an awful lot and it feels an awful lot like what we saw back in Nineteen Ninety seven where you had the Asian financial crisis that really started in Thailand um and started largely because at the time uh the the tide currency was it it gets known as the ...\nAnd the tide bought was effectively pegged to the U.S dollar in order to keep it stable at the time well what happened was that the government could maintain that pig and they had the floated a in order to you know effectively try to\nUm you know keep the currency of photo keep the country afloat and it ended up causing all kinds of problems throughout the region that ended up spilling over into the U.S as well um for a short time period there what worries me about this in this emerging markets situations were far more tied into these markets\nThan we were Twenty years ago it could have a bigger effect on the U.S and the effect is pretty significant even back in Ninety seven\nWell and not to mention that foreign exchange on you know currency fluctuations aside their vulnerability is in the government get distress area you know you have 'em over forty five percent of the low income countries at a higher risk and that just gas or already experiencing it according to the IMF\nWhich is compared to only twenty five percent five years ago and in fact\nWe've already had a couple of these countries you know seek bailouts from the IMF and two of them yeah Pakistan you know aspirin IMF fail out you know earlier this year I Ching teenagers now facing that said this high levels and that are really concerning and like you said have a clear impact because we are such an intertwined globally client economy today\nAnd and this is clearly when you when if you point to what is causing this is the strength of the dollar over the course of this year as you mentioned\nA you know investors flocking back to the dollar with higher rates and you have the dollar up about ... percent for the course of the year and that makes it very difficult if you are in these other countries to keep capital in your local currency just because investors will say\nGee why do I want to hold the Argentinean pay so if it's losing forty percent against the dollar I could make fifty percent but still when we get ten percent on my money it doesn't make sense for me to hold that currency and that's why you see money flocking out\nOf those countries here along with this or a statement that was made yesterday by Dallas Fred president Robert Kaplan said that he wanted the fed to hike rage three more times one in December and then two more at sometime next year and then pause at that point to see if any additional increases are nests\nDefinitely there watching you know productivity as one of the indicators are watching inflation they're watching whether or not are starting to season bubbles and some of the asset and that people trade and\nOn you know and they're trying to figure out what you know it's their right what they called the neutral rate which is a a level of um rate that neither ... nor slows growth and that's that's kind of tricky I mean some some you know economic forecast put that in a meeting estimate about three percent\nUm you know some say it's lower so it's going to be interesting to see what they decide\nLooking at what today's data has done I was a going earlier and I was checking out what we call the fed funds futures which uh predictions for where the Fed's going to raise rates are going forward into the next year generally the predictions on this they go out about twelve months so we can see to really next October at this point we can't see beyond that to the end of the year\nBut the median projection if you're looking at it there's a thirty six percent chance now that there are three hikes\nIn interest rates prior to next October largely unchanged from a day ago but that's up from just the twenty five percent chance a month ago and that's why you have seen interest rates rise a little bit\nOver this time period is people are saying hey look I don't want to get caught behind the eight ball and you'll be holding long term debt we need to sell this off because we're thinking rates are going to be moving up a little bit quicker than expected\nBy the way Tucker and and I believe you have this on the board at this point\nI Am on team we're going to have less hikes than expected because I don't think the fed is going to be able to hike yeah I think your production you're official production is one hike and twenty Nineteen that it just fine that's where I'm at I'm hiking Nineteen so we'll see what happens or\nI Will take a victory lap because it looks like I was going to be right this year ... all pat myself on that for that one out but it's always a New Years so we'll see if we get into\nA as we had the next year some sad news for an American or a great American companies fears higher\nYou can visors to prepare for bankruptcy filing\nYeah I mean definitely sad because it's such an iconic brand in such a part of Americana and a lot of ways but not surprising at all I mean given the rising online retailing where they hadn't been able to keep out\nAnd also just you know lack of investment in their stores on you know fears and malls no longer really need those anchor stories as much anymore because the mall traffic is down overall on satellite so unfortunately you know Sears is feeling the impact of all this chance\nThis also does give me the opportunity to talk about my favorite items from the Sears catalogs that used to be around and and there's all kinds of websites that have these by the way but some of the things that they offered a back in the day this one is from\nIt looks like night teen over to this is the fall and I you know two and they had to Heidelberg electric belt which sent electric current through kind of your your your droid effectively to cure quote a week or deranged nervous system\nThis is a real thing that's always reliable they sold it for Eighteen dollars back then other things that we have from Nineteen oh actually I'm Sorry the phone Nineteen hundred catalog\nGot into fashion with ladies plus capes really so you could have a Cape and these look like they were going for eight dollars and thirty five cents they were very nice I Believe there for\nA massive been considered really high end at the time huh I Would imagine you know everyone was walking around and capes then but the best thing that we had\nA we're still in this one from fall Nineteen thirty two\nUh the home catch ... where you could literally order all the materials for a house\nOr they deliver it right to where you want it to build it and you'd be able to build your house or wherever you wanted a this is a home kit that was a Fifteen hundred and twenty nine dollars for the entire kittens to be able to build your house it looks like it was about twelve hundred square feet\nSo bad at a dollar per square foot\nUm and it's it's still is one of I think the most amazing things that you know this is a company that would literally deliver you the materials to build an entire house and now they're going out of business because they lost out to companies that want to deliver to your house\nExactly exactly well and so unfortunate too because I mean they did you know carry on that strong tradition of supplying a home in the Kenmore brand is such a wonderful brand appliances and everything and it's a real shame\n[laughter] let's take a break here when we come back we're going to talk about whether or not you're going to want to get on a plane when your

seemed to I'm not I like unless you hire an actor who can wear a pilot's hat and I would feel much better if you want Matt Damon flying you find out that would be great OK okay it's just a comfort level thing a totally is stupid but I just like knowing that there's a human\nLike wearing a hat yeah so you can head of ... and ... and they can maybe give you know those wings to the kids never even

the whole question right now would you fly on a plane piloted by a robot\nYeah you know shock here the surprise or little shock whatsoever a bell was leading the way our our listeners ship at sixty one percent or that they were not flying a plane piloted by it robots\nWe get some we've got some texts that are coming in as well or from nine seven eight uh I'd rather have a robot than the pilot who crashed into a mountain on purpose or will I don't happen it it did happen in Germany actually it was German pilot how uh I don't know if it was in Germany but a German pilot who had been suffering\nFrom depression walk the other pilot out of the cabinet and crashed into the side of a mountain so it was a sad situation about maybe a year or so ago\nI'm from five oh wait no think hacking imagine if a on the Apollo moon landing a are trying to take over due to a computer ... well here's the thing when we talked about hacking you're assuming that that computers networked and connected to other computers\nIf it's not ... not really a problem you like you can't hack a super Nintendo you can't hack an Atari because it's not connected to the Internet\nOr needs to be connected to air traffic control somehow\nWhy does the computer I have to be\nBecause they need to go ahead to land\nBut what you're missing you're you're missing the the critical point here why does that stack why does that section of the operating system after be connected to what actually flies the plane\nWell you need somebody whoever's in air traffic control the land the plane to go ahead so that there needs to be some sort of line of communication between the tower and the plane\nBut why does that system have to be connected to the one that actually flies that is what is what I'm getting at\nI just literally told you\nYou know ... no\nNo no no ... you're saying that air traffic control has to be able to talk to one system on the plane\nWithout saying is why does that other system after being networked in it it doesn't have to be thinking about it this way Tucker when you go and if you've got what what do you have an iPhone six iPhone yes success does that have the uh the fingerprint on it yet when you press the fingerprint ... do you know where that fingerprint goes no take a guess\nOn the phone exactly it stays on the phone the entire time right it doesn't actually send it back to anywhere on it it's not actually talking to apple ... how would the Plano when\nTo land think about it this way when you made it out of so many planes when when you make an apple pay purchased a you use your phone in a fingerprint scanner write write your fingerprint is never sent to the ... route to where the transactions process no ... yeah\nI understand what you're saying that I think that that's a different analogy isn't it because I think what ... saying is that like there has to be a connection between the receiver of the joint production in the sky and and and then I I agree with that knowledge of things on the plane\nI I agree with that but what it doesn't have to do is it doesn't have to interface with what actually steers the plane\nI don't know when you get what I'm saying I I I Do because there's going to be planes that are delayed or so that running I had it all ended up buying planes landing at ... ... ... what's the concern when when you talk about how can a plane what what what is that if the concern is that somebody else is going to take control the plane right\nIn what I'm saying is you separate the control right from what actually what tells the plane where to go in that\nWay I'm not I'm not I'm not even talking about hacking I'm Talking about everyday use of the plane and landing\nBut what I'm telling you you can separate either said oh ahead go ahead for America trying to do what they need to go ahead but the Tucker when when I give apple but go ahead right do I actually send them my fingerprint\nNo exact ... that's what I'm saying ... so you can separate those systems I don't think it's a gruesome allergy and all the exact same thing yeah I don't think it is [laughter]\nYou're not going to stray me on that one needs to be some sort of line of communication between the ... ... I Know the sky but half of it but it does not have\nTo send all of the information okay we'll see what you can keep the information secured in a local system and not have it be accessible just like the iPhone does with what's called a secure enclave with your fingerprint that fingerprint never goes the apple service so you can do the exact same thing on a plane\nLeader bank as a team of business

yes now sixty eight percent\nNo apparently no one wants to find a robot playing with me which means I'm going to have a whole row to myself which is going to be phenomenal you all can stick on those full piloted flights but I'll have a whole road of myself and be cheaper you think\nOr be the same price nothing will change I think they would try to keep at the same as much as they can yeah\nMy guess would be pretty close to me the biggest cost the airline have are are typically fuel costs followed pretty closely\nUm I think by just all the regulatory stuff with you know William Gates and this and that I Know pilots are obviously expensive but\nYou know pilots they're not making you know a hundred thousand dollars a flight rights okay but you know there are legitimate expense but I don't think you'd be a huge shift in ticket costs just because you know fuel and maintenance or such big pieces there um\nBut I can pull ups and data on that uh as we go here some breaking news that we just got flashing across earlier that CBS the deal that my kid mentioned was likely to get approval today did get approval today don't\nWith condition with conditions are likely condition we're still trying to get some data or some information on what exactly those or it looks like the condition is that there's going to have to sell Medicare part D drug plan business over the well care health um\nBut I don't see any other potential conditions um but will continue to keep you updated on that travelers the insurance company is going to start selling home security gear on Amazon this is an interesting mix here\nChristine yeah I found it really interesting but it's a it's really a move by travelers to try to meet customers where they are not as many customers are buying 'em through agents in fact there is a shift towards buying things on line\nAnd said travelers is making a move by getting on to Amazon and and selling all these homes security products at a discount current travelers customers\nAnd encouraging people to purchase insurance to travelers website [noise]\nI Do want to go back to the airline story briefly about pilots just I'm again I'm I'm a welfare planes so I get kind of caught up on these things up fuel costs typically this is according to the uh airlines for America website who knows\nA few expenses make up about Twenty one percent of all expenses that you pay for in a fight\nFederal government taxes makeup twenty percent labor makes up Seventeen percent now labor keep in mind is not just the pilot it's also your gate agents your flight attendants\nUh your maintenance crews and so forth flooded and then non labor in non fuel expense is making forty one percent but those are you know a whole bunch of different areas but waiver overall mix up Seventeen percent my guess is the pilots are probably\nBetween twenty and thirty percent of that so if you had no pilot it might be five percent cheaper but I don't think you get much below that will be my guess\nI'm not back to this Amazon store sorry for the railing 'cause I like planes\nAre what are we talked about this Amazon and and travel or story here I Do think it's interesting\nUh the travelers is is moving in this direction here just because you know again the incentive for travelers as well get more people have security devices and rain monitors and so forth\nIt becomes cheaper for them to ensure against losses would I'm curious about is your travelers isn't selling their own products it's you know different brands I'm curious how travelers ends up making money off of this when it's all said and done well it's more about establishing\nI think a presence on Amazon for Amazon itself moves into insurance\nDo you think they well yeah I mean I think Amazon is slowly finding different markets that it can take over and the fact is is that there is rising interest in buying insurance and filing insurance claims on line to travelers is leveraging a platform that exists and is he saying okay we're going to meet you where you are\nDo you work with a dedicated insurance agent or do you just go on to you know whatever website you go onto and buy it online which how how do you typically\nDo right now I work with an agent but I Do that because I Do my research on line so I could see more and more people will be find this on line absolutely interesting all the time we have on this\nHour of the show but we'll be back in just a bit with a whole lot more on the financial exchange radio network\n[noise]\nMS R. P. envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms on\nWhat they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about

Dave Anthony\nIf you made the choice not to evacuate please find a place to shelter seek a place of refugees\nThat's up people problem not a robot I Know I fully understand some people if if people can't wrap their minds around the fact that something might be safer now\nThat's not the robots fault no it's not you know that's that's like saying\nOh well we we shouldn't like I I Can't even I'm trying to figure out like a comparable here just something that's made a huge difference over the last like ten years that yeah it's a little scary to think about but it actually works way better\nUm if anyone has any ideas he can test in but I just I find it amazing that we're so distrustful of robots and yet we just trust humans we say oh yeah humans can handle it when it's been proven time and time again\nThat we can't do a lot of cases it's it's not that I don't trust pilots it's just that robots are really really good at what they do uh-huh\nAnd I don't I'm just a big believer and always having a backup plan to do with the humans have a backup plan that the robots at the river I have a backup plan to humans I just think let's combine the two you know teamwork is always the better option\nHere's another problem with continuing to have a pilot's operating and smaller and smaller roles is robots do more\nIs there's actually been a number of studies done are with regards to pilots the pilots that are trained today and they grow up onto the systems don't actually pick up the skills they need to be able to react in a crisis because they're not piling the plane enough to be able to know what to do\nSo pretty much they're still rely on the auto pilot and on their instruments and so forth that when something goes wrong they don't know what to do the same way that the pilot ... who who would have been trained Thirty years ago knows what to do because they grew up in an era when they were much more hands on with the plane\nSo I didn't even make the argument that because of the way pilots are trained today\nShorter training times as well as more reliance on systems newer pilots that are being trained don't necessarily have the skills to be able to do that anyway\nSo I mean that just guys can kind of a ... a fundamental kind of\nIssue across the board across different industries in terms of education exposure to different situations right I mean you see that even healthcare though is that there is a story recently about um him innovations and maternity ward in the hospital I Believe in the south shore\nOn and how they were looking at trying to regain variant birth on because there have been such a reliance on trying to control the birth that ... through the roof and a lot of doctors didn't have the skills\nUm to to be able to handle you know preach first an unusual price so they're trying to bring that back through a team model and ah\nI just think it's interesting just you know we rely ON Technology so much that like you said we're not giving ourselves the time we need in order to develop skills and I think that there is an argument to be made across the board across different industries reinvest singing that education and teaching people how to do it\nYou did bring up in this this actually I'm I'm going to hijack your point and completely is try to make my point out I'm Sorry in advance [laughter] watch\nRobot assisted surgery we see this used in a tone of common procedures right now are all over the place we see robots that are being used to do surgery that traditionally had been done by hand with a doctor but we see them being used\nBecause they're often more efficient and more precise than a doctor can be in some of these surgeries we don't say no I Want a doctor there to do that we say hey the robots just as good if not better in some cases\nAnd doctors have said yeah you know what they actually are and so you see robots being used more commonly in a lot of these cases if we can trust robots with surgery can we trust him to fly a plane\n[laughter]\nI guess that's where we stand on that so you can either texting under six three five six six\nAnd I'll continue to take all the punishment that's coming my way 'cause I

your benefits\nIf going getting worse and um you're out of pocket a spending keeps getting higher and so it really is affecting people's take home pay you know about a hundred and fifty one million Americans\nGet their benefits through their employer and literally the costs keep going up every year now for decades\n[noise] so can you describe some of the things that you outlined in your article specifically some of the cases ah this this one in Montana what companies are trying to do in order to mitigate those costs\nIf it's not right now to be completely honest you know do we in it and it's so hard for us to measure those costs change because someone will say oh gee the cost of a ... you know your plan went up by five percent this year\nBut when it by five percent but you're deductible increased by twenty percent so how much more you actually paying really tough to measure those changes\nAbsolutely and you know as our population demographics chefs for have an aging population we're

comes back in\nThere is definitely there definitely is creativity in a a I guess new idea I'm open mindedness in terms of Starbucks but the one thing that they really gave up on soon it through in the white flag our white talent on was the wine do remember that it only\nLasted for maybe like six months to a year they\nWere trying wine at some of the stores and it barely lasted a year and it's just like I feel like that could have been a really nice niche therefore Starbucks you know ... you know right around you know seven o'clock there still technically open but you can go for coffee and dessert or you have a glass of wine and wine tasting or something like that you know you don't want\nWonder about on that is if maybe I I I almost think that it could have been successful\nBut they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah you know is its own they I don't know what you call like you're not going to call wind box but whatever you want to call ... ... thing that actually sounds smart but just you know Starbucks is a place where people sit down you know they might spend the afternoon working on their novel or on a business plan or something and then a couple of people come in to see them\nBut it might not be the right atmosphere for hey I Want to stop and for you know a couple of hours in the afternoon just for a glass of wine to catch up with someone I almost wonder if they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah it's a small place it's not a bar it's you know still more of that cafe fielder but just a different\nBrand yeah the environment just doesn't to me lend itself to kind of a wine bar when you think of the ... of those kind of like ... you know not really that the cafe wonder about licensing because you know how you up you know put up some hot area that's tough yeah and you're going to go like town by town\nAnd I'm there should be like a wine bar or you know the Marshall Starbucks or something like that but it's something in downtown Boston or something like you know somewhere near Boston I think I could see that happening a\nWeekly mortgage applications down one point seven percent we know of interest rates above a rather mortgage rates above five percent a thirty year fixed mortgages which just psychologically feels like a huge difference I mean don't get me wrong it is a big difference from where we were a year and a half ago at three and a half\nPercent but it just when you see that five in front of you know the the decimal can we haven't seen that he's alive [laughter] like\nI I think about it for someone like me and I'm someone who again by the time I got out of college rates were bottoming out okay I look at it and I say I've never seen that that five number up their consistently when I've been in the market for house it just it feels different\nYup yup well and not to mention the market in general is also facing weak demand for re five which has really affected the whole industry\nThat that's the indicator that was kind of bothering me a little bit is that more homebuyers are looking at those riskier adjustable rate loans and to me that just smacks of you know what we face in the
