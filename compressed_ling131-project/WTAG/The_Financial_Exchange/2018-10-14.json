we meet again make peace be with you this day\nYeah we knew what we saw\n\n\nThe issues sure\n\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nOctober more than what's new today on the free our radio our heart radio\nA perfect for decorating the house or just studying the dairy mood\nSun comes in son's been really running the business\nAs of late so maybe over the last six months\nAnd it's a it's a bed and breakfast type place where it's about eight hundred grand in a house in South Carolina where it's about eight hundred grand in a hundred and sixty grand and the bank okay\nShe's now back up here in mass and she's going to go into nursing home and mass mhm\n... what can we do what's the situation here well I started asking questions and say well here's what we can do you wouldn't think about this this is something you can get eligible for Medicaid last minute with these kinds of assets adds a lot you can the answer is absolutely yes how one of\nThe business property right that's a business\nSo it's a rental type kind of place right it's a bed and breakfast\nIt's non accountable because it's generating income essential to self support so we have a provision regulation that allows that to be non accountable so we take eight hundred thousand off the table\nWould that be true if it were just a straight business Todd and not a rental property type situation I think so okay yes I Do I Will comes off the table\nNow they're going to put a lean on it mhm that's OK the liens always your friend because it's going to be at a much lower medicated rate than the private pay rate for the nursing home mhm way lower some like fourteen Fifteen thousand a month down to six\nPlus you get to use the ... rent\nTo maintain the property right so you get tips you get you get the rent to maintain the property and it's the ... rent that you give the nurse so after all your expenses that's ... and even that that rent along with your Social Security all goes towards reducing\nThe amount of money that the state would be paying so that lean every month to smaller clean get smaller ... okay\nSo I've got the business of property off the table [noise]\nWhat about the south Carolina property normally that was her home\nWell homes or non accountable for single people\nUnless they're not located in the state oh I remember that they have to be located in the state so that's the first issue but then I find out for single people if you move out of the house you can treat it as a former home\nAnd then the former home requirement does not require you to be living in the state ... it just says it has to be the former home and doesn't say where it has to be located to solve so now I Believe that South Carolina property will be protected from the nursing home and\nNot even sure they can put a lean on it because it's out of state there's some gray area as to whether or not in\nMassachusetts or any state tend to lean\nOut of state property interesting so at least we know the south Carolina property would be non accountable because we were checked the box sets her home the former residents and she intends to return home even if she can mhm wonderful so the ... so there's a million six off the table already\n[noise] we've got a hundred and sixty thousand in cash yeah he can only in two thousand 'cause she's single it's exactly right Susan so we're stuck with the two thousand ah how do we get rid of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nWe can either by an annuity or use a pool trust mhm so probably depending on her age will take the money and put it into a pool trust might be easier um and and I would do that if I Would probably only do the pull trust if\nThe annuity doesn't work number wise meaning she's probably over Ninety so let's say she's eighty five I might do a pool ... am I doing annuity mhm go out by a medicated annuity convert the asset into an income stream and she'll receive a monthly check\nAnd now that hundred and fifty thousand is no longer an asset preventing her from becoming eligible for Medicaid but instead ... was converted by buying the annuity into an income stream for her\nNow we've got her on Medicaid or there'll be willing to pay back actually but so what\nI might not do the pool trust because the pull trust while it also would protect the money it not only has the pay back but it also has that little charitable piece that you got to pay ... depending on how long you live there either twenty percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home more than two years\nOr ten percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home less than two years so I should say two years or more you pay twenty yeah less than two years you pay ten\nSo you don't have the charity peace with the pay back on the annuity mhm so that's the difference between those two\nSo now you see we actually can get this person eligible for Medicaid that all sounds great right\nExcept what I saw going on in the bank accounts for the business\n[noise] a lot of times the people that would work there would want to be paid in cash oh so there's withdrawals if for cash checks to pay the cash in ... and then she would pay the cash well also there would be checks to cash\nOr checks written to the son\nWho's actually working there and done plumbing the opening the closing but if it's a check from your bank account which really was just in her name yet to the sun that's going to look like a gift\nAnd now you're going to have to prove that all these transfers we're actually not gifts mhm\nYou might be able to prove it you might not be able to so be careful how you operate it you're going to pay somebody to give them a W to write the check from the company you know show that it's reported on their income tax return show that they work there\nThese are things to think about operationally now having said all that I Am going to just give you this last thought\nIf they had done all of this and put it into these trust in advance the house and the vacate or the house and the rental property would already be protected ... New Orleans and you wouldn't have to do any of this stuff last minute\nLaugh scrambling to see your family from that strife of scrambling last minute because that's truly what you're doing here\nIdeal

com\nFor more information member FDIC equal housing lender\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us this thing when we're talking rulings are your questions about anything and everything that including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nQuestions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Phil in Dorchester math and filled writes my wife recently passed away unexpectedly\nWe were in the process of drying up our trust but we never got to execute them before she died is there anything that can be done now to save our state a state tax exemptions we were worth around one point eight million when she passed what are you guys give us\nA magic wand is why we do planning and they were actually in their defense they were in the process of doing it true true\nA really a great story in the sense that that it can it can really help us understand\nAnd how not planning is harmful mhm right so if you have one point eight million and you were successful at setting up to trust\nOr say to irrevocably trust that could be one replicable either way or that has the marital sharing the remainder share built in what that means is it's it's easier to explain what to trust say where I put\n... put nine hundred thousand dollars of assets in one trust and nine hundred thousand in another trust ... when the first spouse in this case died say the wife if she had done the planning right\nThere'd be nine hundred thousand dollars in her trust whether it's revoke a bowler irrevocably is irrelevant mhm what matters is there's two buckets that form inside her trust\nPeople need to realize that this trust doesn't fold up and go away and everything flows out into the spouses hands no the whole point of the trust is that it does not die mhm it keeps on going\nAnd we then take the nine hundred thousand dollars of stuff that's in the trust\nAnd allocated to a share called the remainder share or to the marital share of these trust the remainder of the bypass shared gets the amount of assets up to the state exemption ... a million in Massachusetts yeah or your state exemption\nAnd the amount over that\nCan go to the marital share in the marrow share allows us to make tax elections which I don't need to get into right now cause in this case there's nine hundred and the nine hundred would end up in the remainder share for the benefit of the surviving spouse mhm\nAnd because of the way that remained or share is drafted you would end up having those assets not just flowing into the hands of the healthy spouse but there for the healthy spouses benefit yup or surviving now different ... right\nBut she doesn't own it and so she doesn't own it if the surviving spouse doesn't own it\nThen when the surviving spouse dies it's not taxable what if it grows though what if they're hurt your his trust grows to be twice as that\nDoesn't matter never doesn't matter how much it grows it will never be whatever's left in there when the surviving spouse dies is not owned by the surviving spouses therefore not taxable and surviving spouses estate\nBut because of that it would have been caused to be taxed in the\nFirst spouse to dies estate\nBut it's nine hundred thousand you said we got a formula built in there that says hey the amount up to the exemption goes in this bucket mhm oh look it's less than a million\nSo while it's subject attacks in the first spouses estate to die there's an exemption to use it up\nSo we file a tax return but we don't have to pay taxes good question and the answer is no if it's less than ... million dollar filing threshold I don't even need to file nice the estate tax return\nAnd there's no tax too so what about those folks that didn't get around to doing their planning we know federally you can use portability but is that available in the state can we do not available in this state\nSo you lose that and just to play out the string what happens right because if you follow the string I just did with the planning mhm\nNo tax on the first death less than a million\nSurviving spouse dies I say there's nine hundred thousand in her trust mhm less than a million no tax yep period\nThis way because no planning was done everything will likely went to the surviving spouse mhm [noise] surviving spouses now worth one point eight million which again this is why the marital deduction is so beneficial for the government not for us right it pumps up the surviving spouse as a state\nWith the deceased spouse disaster mhm so now she's at one point eight million which is greater than the million dollar exemption so when she dies there is about an eighty thousand dollar Massachusetts a state tax liability do anything to be done with that and now\nI Can't think of anything I assume they just have simple wills that leave everything to each other so if they have simple wills that leave everything to each other the only thing you can really do at this point would be file a disclaimer saying treat me surviving spouse as if I died\nAnd then everything would go well that was going to come to me would go to my kids but now it's not but now you don't have the spout right while you might be able to I don't necessarily think I liked the result of that\nAnd you know folks failed clearly they put off they're planning a little too long I Know that his wife passed unexpectedly but get your planning in place folks there's so many benefits they can come from that and if you're concerned not just a boat estate taxes and blood line cleaning and boating probate\nMaybe you're concerned about depleting those assets impoverishing your spouse if you go into a nursing home\nFind out how these eerie vocal tries to operate signed up the information that absolutely must be in your trust as well as those clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust\nCall right now to request you're free copy of Todd's designing ... trust guide at eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine or download a copy on our website legal exchange show dot com Todd our last question comes from Karen in brain the math and Karen writes I transferred money into my ear evoke trust four years ago\nI'd like to lend my daughter's some money to buy a house can I give her a loan from the trust that can be forgiven if I pass away and consider it as an advance on her inheritance I don't need the money selling fine if she doesn't actually we pay it to me\nSo you know Susan this is a great example just to show a and really it goes to the materials how flexible\nAnd to revoke will trust can be right 'cause all the operational things that we do for the trust from day to day are also laid out in
