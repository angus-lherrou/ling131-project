they were in the kitchen when the gunman entered the synagogue and they were killed and then they're going to be buried today so the president will be there today and I think it's uh\nIt's a good moment to reflect on this we're hearing from Democrats that there's been a rise in anti Semitism since President Trump became president\nOkay so you're relating\nTo President Trump is there anything else it's going on like on college campuses like boycotting Israel is there anything else that's going on the actual anti Semitism that exists on college campuses why wouldn't you related to that\nAnd the rise in it\nEspecially following President Trump's decision to make good on a promise many presidents have made but never fulfilled which was to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nWhy would you related to President Trump so all of a sudden President Trump is president and anti Semite CERN powered I don't get it I'd love I'd love to understand the connection there\nBut relating it to his presidency is like relating to I said earlier the price of Twinkies going up\nNames while the price of Twinkies have gone up since Trump became president All right well what's what's the correlation Trump's president price went up Trump's president more anti Semitism you Mimi intolerance on the left couldn't be to blame for this\nThe recognition of of Jerusalem as the capital of

first we have our good friend bills him for joining us now national correspondent good morning bill\n... good morning to you sir I'm gonna let you spend the wheel today what are we on today we still at the tree of life synagogue\nNo uh we are looking at the spin wheels down to the U.S Mexico border once again\nAll right so we're going to have a tent city down there right\nAfter the president wants to do and he is really just laying it out for any immigrants who might have an eye on the U.S border number one sending over five thousand active military troops\nOr to the border area and saying yeah we're going to set up tent cities if you're on it and try to make it up to the U.S border there will be ten cities waiting for you there will also be a very strict asylum process not very many people are going to make it through that and it could take him off\nSo uh this process will be a very deliberate and very strict\nOffer those who want to try to get into the United states legally ah now with the troops are doing is number on sending a strong message\nIn advance of the midterm elections of course the president is laying his immigration policy out there even though the main caravan of these immigrants coming up from Central America is still about eight hundred miles away from the border jam\nOr where we're starting what's called operation faithful patriots five thousand addicts are the two thousand National Guard troops\nSorry so that's the name of the mission now but I'm the same so betrayed now he's going to build these tent cities on the Mexican side of the border or right on the border\nI think it's going to have to be on the U.S side of the border I don't think he can put them inside of the border but they would be immediately put in these tent cities and wait for evaluation and\nTruthfully uh the way that uh the asylum process is going to be set up I I mean if they are not many people would be granted asylum\nI last may can really prove a hardship and the threat for their personal safety or if or if they turn to their homeland so this is going to be ... I think the message is out there this is not as easy as they think it's going to be\nThat we're talking with bills in for a national correspondent so built to do things here but then I Want to give the caviar that I think could\nHurt the strategy so strategy by the president is one you're not we're not going to let you flood the border and so that we have to let you go and and basically go into the United states like the last time this happened we're going to hold you and basically detention camps ten city is a pretty way of saying it was his detention camp were going to hold you there\nAnd then we're going to evaluate you there\nAnd he feels that one it will stop the influx into like you said you will send a message to the second caravan I'm hearing about that may have bind when people in it\nThat don't bother you you're not going to be able to get in like everybody else and overwhelmed the border and get it right\nRight that's exactly what he's talking about now I think we can point out that these groups that are headed to that area now they're they're going to staging areas in the south Texas Arizona and California and then we'll be deployed to certain areas along the border it's not like they're going to be along the border with rifles trained at immigrant running or\nAre these are not combat troops there support group\nA military police pilots who will be using helicopters and fixed wing aircraft for surveillance including a night vision equipment yeah along the border area to help out the border patrol there will be no direct interaction between these military members and the immigrant\nThe exactly I understand that and\nBut here's my here's my cabinet you set up these tent cities you better make sure they're well run because the media is going to be down there and they're going to be taking pictures and they're going to be saying these poor people are in the hot desert in these tents and they should be allowed just to come into the United states\nThey looked at his head and I said now I Know you are having a bathroom but you don't think it and who are legal documents\nWell the point is I'm saying is hold on a second this is very serious you're making an accusation show did you share it with the family did you tell the family up here we're\nNot allowed to read from people don't understand that at all on outweigh the negatives al ... the thing is that how we see patients I\nDon't understand why I don't understand why the Massachusetts nurses association hasn't gone directly to the department of public health with this and so John ... if I knew that my loved one died in the hospital because the nurses thought there was enough care I wouldn't want to know that\nOh absolutely ... why why you want to guess what I'm getting at is where all the way in a ballot question here you are someone die why is that all the way to a ballot question and not being dealt with the way that it should have to me I don't\nRemember what we do and I don't mean to interrupt you but just so you could understand so the way across that way is that we sell out on faith ... for him and that was our legal document back where that is what where do we have found out\nI mean you have to form after foreign trip back here it is that the\n... and here's here's what I'm having trouble believing if there were this many why haven't there been lawsuits why why isn't a lawyer taking your form\nTaking the ... I went well but see I'm asking I'm asking you because I find it hard to believe that if there was a legal document that said my my loved one died being a nurse said because there wasn't a nurse there in time to save them when they were coating\nHospitals would be close left and right because of malpractice\nWherever a thing that why we're going for like ... but again and I say it's ... I I find it hard to believe I have the handler dying every day\nThere are no no ... I'm ... I'm sympathetic to the plight of nurses I'm sympathetic to the plight of everybody else being asked to do more with less but I find that hard to build\nIn the people are dying every day and the only answer is a ballot question that that this hasn't gone anywhere else in no state representative is listen to it no one no one else has believed that the the department of public health in the commonwealth of Massachusetts is drawing a blind eye to people dying every day\nThat believe me I mean I've been watching this over and or how 'bout how 'bout rabbi that fog and break the hip and then I read it because there wasn't enough to the bathroom or\nWhat but the thing that I have a you know I only know because I worked in health care I Know a kind of reports have to be filled out for falls in for everything else my background was actually in health care that's why I find is so hard to\nBelieve that people are dying every day and that the ... and the risk management within the institution\nIsn't isn't taking a look at this but you know what I've got I've got a couple of calls Becky I appreciate your calling and God Bless you for the work you do I've got to go to Robin now who's another nurse\nRobin you've heard what I've said was Becky I Know you may have a a different story but please explain to me how all these deaths are going on and no one's doing anything 'cause I I find that hard to believe\nThat her third graph ever hospital acquired conflict\nFree from from from ... not\nFrom there it's having too many declare for um I also have a hospital for a while you are right or central why infections have gone up higher rates are on track in fact I have to have gone up ... or ... yeah\nMy hospital you know so why is it or hold on a second and that's all fine and that's why I'm saying this is crossing over into politics now and I'm ... I'm ... no but I'm suspect of it because of the union supporting it\nI'm suspect of it because of that and and I am a pro union person but hold hold on while I'm not pro you I mean I support the rights of unions I I don't believe these are all evil why isn't this being handled by the department of public health I Know that a hospital\nA and M. and C Q A rating or any other kind of quality rating would suffer considerably for rates going up really admits going up\nOkay you know all that infamous so you're saying you're saying that the government is completely ignoring this the the the folks who are supposed to look out\nFor our health care system are ignoring it well then all the more reason why why would I Want to and trust them with setting up ratios of nurses hospitals\n... upper when all on the government wrapped up here in ... bought this platform for that popular but in the fast food\nAnd you're asking the government to enforce a no no no I get it Robin you're asking the government to enforce it at your your this for like a law where cars have to have a break in the past year and that isn't going to go ahead Rob is going to\nCall and tell you why would you\nPlease please I'll finish the finish the thought\nSo\nWorkers are asking a public vote will have set limit for medical care from Iraq or has\nHe has a you know I'm going to cut you off out all the you know Robin Robin and Robin Robin hold on I'm going to Robin\nRobin see Robin you're what you're saying is a polite way it's spin\nWe're asking people to have said public know you're asking the government to the Robin you're you're Mike isn't on\nYou're asking the government\nTo create a one size fits all pro Red Cloud on size or I didn't get Robert on the side but to see if youre saying I'm asking people to do this no you're asking the government to enforce more regulation on\nWill they're not ... if if you're asking them to enforce more regulation\nYou are at the same time telling me that they are not properly regulating the hospitals now how can I trust them to regulate noodles to run for re looking\nFor [laughter] for our corporate practice we're asking them for a law that were very black and white if you have enough work right now\nBut we but why we could do that for every we can do that for every single industry what I'm getting at is\nIf if he or animals or and if you are concerned about the quality of Robin if you're concerned about the quality of care of your patients and I believe you are because I Believe you don't go into nursing\nJust for the money you know every nurse I Know is a special individual you you don't go into it for the money the same reason you don't go into what I Do for the money because you have to love what you do it's very difficult\nBut my point here is if this was going on and the government is ignoring it why is the first solution\nA question\nBut man that's a ratio I let them I'm being told being told that the hospitals are safe right now we're ... we're not who I Am not saying anything because there are no you're not seeing anything Robin tell me why now I prefer prefer then\nWell what was what what did you do before the only like ... who were white yacht asking for the same piece of legislation for twenty year old I remember was started\nIn the past five ... hospital at ... dot on strike or frightened to strike regarding staffing\nMouse random at a slum in Russia how how how many automobile man how many automobile man you don't use that statistic how many automobile manufacturers have had their labor threatened to go on strike in the past five years\nBut are thrown back from the ... well on the court room where I found from what I found\nWhy why aren't you why are you making ... ... what I'm saying is and what I said to I'm Becky when she called this if you know somebody died because they weren't nurses there why didn't you tell the family and if you did tell the family why am I not hearing about massive lawsuits\nRob crop and but there are several other court\nOr even when they're settled out of court it has to be reported to the ph it's all public record\nIt's all public record I worked in health care I don't know no hospital\nI don't know how hard for for hiring or ... former third concern and go to a malpractice foyer I don't know how that works that something like that I'm with her\nHospitals would be out of business if it if if the way that it's being presented by the Massachusetts nurses association is is a true reflection of what's going on in our healthcare system or health care system would be out of business right now because of not the lawsuits but as you said the settlements due to the settlements\nWere a lot of them were former unaware that have come from preventable why didn't you tell them\nAnd when we work for hospitals for over for the information you want to get fired no", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "31"}
