News President Trump tweeted that about the caravan of seven thousand migrants headed to the U.S saying he's alerted the border patrol in the military because Mexico was unable to stop it and what a model of Honduras and El Salvador quote neither so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nAnd then it gee I Do need to uh buy a new car yeah let's just tap the equity line why not doing\nRates are getting high though you know you want to use your home equity like say you and your wife decide oh we're going to use our home equity to buy a car that six percent interest why couldn't you get a better loan rate than that on a car\nDepends on your credit quality in some cases you can you know if you've got really good credit you might be able to get a you know a better rate but keep in mind a lot of those teaser rates where they say oh it's you know zero money down and zero percent interest for sixteen months you know that is if you've got the best credit near an awful lot of people that don't necessarily have the best credit so\nI I think you know when we talk about the higher rates I think that is going to be something in the short term that does have an impact because people are going to look at that and say\nGee it's it's really expensive now like I was looking at my equity line that I have on my house and just because of how it was set up and how it's tied at seven and a quarter percent not hikes you know I'm I'm not so that's a that's something you would use as a last resort\nExactly you know I I have no desire to tap that but that that they're getting my personal perspective I realized that I'm not necessarily the same person that someone news listening to the to the show ... ... they're not behaving the same way I Do necessarily so I look at it in my my general point of view when it comes to debt\nIs if you give human beings the capacity to take that out they will take\nForty four percent of homeowners between the ages of sixty and Seventy who have outstanding mortgage debt anticipate still having some mortgage debt when they retire\nDidn't used to be that way the ... when you you would not dare retire in the old days you would not dare retire with a mortgage that was like\nYou you have to get rid of the mortgage before he retired [noise] not so much anymore\nDo you think it was easier twenty Thirty years ago a combination of home prices incomes and you know just general principles do you think it was easier to retire without a mortgage in the seventies or eighties\nI think people lived in within their means to a different degree you look at the older generation they\nYou know that the principles I guess though like it does it and that's you know that's why I come back to the emotional scarring of two thousand eight you know forty years ago Chuck the people that were paying off their mortgages before they retired yet we're children of the depression\nAnd and they had a different mindset they grew up in the forties and fifties and all they heard about was the great depression when unemployment was twenty five and\nEverybody was losing their house it psychologically they were trained to pay off your mortgage as quickly as you can now ... nobody pays after more people die with mortgage\nAnd and I do think you may be onto something there for at least for that age group my my age group where Tucker and I are\nI think our age group is had really negative experiences with debt and also that age group is young enough to be able to make changes in behavior over thirty to forty your time period to change where things are going I think for Generation Next I think for the boomers I I don't think you're seeing any meaningful change in behavior at\nThe snow I like a lot of my friends still have mortgages are poll question today is\nDo you still have a mortgage and or do you think that you will have a mortgage when you retire and if you are already retired just stay in his answer us honestly do you still carry a mortgage on your house you're you're you're Seventy two years old\nYou been retired for six years or are you still carrying a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar mortgage or a home equity line of credit that that's the other thing I see ... is a lot of people use home equity as a and their lines of credit in retirement years so we'll ... we'll see what the answers come by\nA we were talking earlier about mega millions can be one point six billion so we bought tickets for a billion wouldn't we be buying tickets for one point six but\nYou would think so I mean and and keep in mind that one point six I think is going to go up before the uh the jackpot is a is revealed to the weekly make notes twice a week it's a it's Tuesdays and Fridays I Believe I'm In and Powerball I think It's Wednesday and Thursday Powerball by the way still has not been one either\nAnd that's now up to six hundred and twenty million to get to point two billion dollars now up for grabs on these two jackpots here\nThe I I did the math the other day though so the odds on the mega millions are so bad it's one in three hundred and two million dollars right there when it when you three hundred and two million oh my gosh\nSo you think about you know your perspective if you buy twenty million dollars worth of ticket you know you have a one percent chance of winning your odds are still terrible you know and that's true and I are rich [laughter]\nStill determined\nTucker's taking his draft Kings' losses enrolling them over into mega millions nice he's taking\nA hopefully not taking his home downpayment fund and putting it in may the letter that he has his wife is as rock that account up I think about how nice of a house you'd be able to buy for one point six billion dollars you know what I look at it you know I don't know it's a one point six so there'll be a drawing tomorrow night\nIf it's going to be tomorrow night one point six by the way the funny thing on this so you drive past any of the stores that have the mega millions and you know they list the jackpot and hey here's how much is available\nIt can't lift how much is available because only has three digits and so just every single one just has nine hundred and Ninety nine million dollars if it doesn't actually say one point six billion ... the system

thousand dollars annually and it's continuing to rise we're talking about the cost of care we're talking about assisted living facilities and we're talking about specifically nursing homes cost of this stuff is just going through the\nRoof and the median cost of a private room in a nursing home is about a hundred thousand a year that obviously has been nationwide costs when you talk about the cost in the northeast and really anywhere on the east coast anywhere not in the middle of the country you're talking significantly higher than that\nUm and so this is one of the biggest things that I think people\nYou know don't necessarily have a clear plan for just because it's really hard to plan for a hundred thousand dollars a year that you're going to be spending on something like this and a lot of cases not very many people that can afford it no I mean you you look at what most people have saved you know they might have a couple of hundred thousand dollars total and so if each spouse ends up\nSpending a year or two in a nursing home it can wipe out the entire state in in the blink of an ...\nYou know the uh I've gone through this process with family members and uh recently that a family member that is going through now they're not in the New England area they're out in Arizona but the cost of it is about four hundred thousand to buy in\nMuch of that four hundred thousand dollars those tax deductible okay so you get a big tax deduction for the four hundred thousand dollar up front and this is not a nursing\nHas one of those aging place ... where they have different levels of care that you gradually move up\nTo it is so and and the four hundred thousand as non refundable you're out like it's when you die it that that's gone you get to know that and the family gets none of that four hundred thousand ... okay and then you're paying a hefty fee every month you're paying you know upwards of six seven thousand dollars a month\nPart of which again is going to be tax deductible too\nDo you think there's anything out there that ever bend the cost curve on this in order to make it more affordable 'cause you know I I've done the math and like people say oh gee I Can't believe that you know a nursing home costs Fifteen thousand dollars a month or something you do the math and you say okay first of all\nHow much would you pay to live in a hotel room on a

it had really strong back to back weekends and so forth\nIt's pretty much closed up at this point but it did two hundred and thirty one million dollars on the thirty million dollar thirty million

made up front even though there is more now with those streaming services there is more that you know ends up happening\nUm but it was you know really good one for Warner Brothers there just because

participation among prime age us women\nTwenty five to fifty four has risen to Seventy five point two percent from Seventy three point three percent three years ago what can we learn from what what's the what's the lesson to be learned from an increased number of women in that age group working\nI think there's there's two things that I really gleaned from it number one uh I think that the cost of running a household today is much higher than it was previously and so you have more families with two spouses working at the number one or the second piece is that we have not seen a similar\nBounce back for men over that time span and as a result I think you look at that and you say why are you know that it raises more questions for me and that\nWire men not coming back into the workforce at the same rate is a drug addiction I'm sure that the well I don't so I don't know because I don't know of drug addiction more men are addicted to drugs that I'm Talking about the opioid crisis if you look at the number I haven't seen the numbers of how how ...\nLike I I'm going to\nUm I don't want to I don't want to put it out there but I I\n'cause I'm going from memory and that memory is failing but I Know a lot more men die from a opioid addiction than women\nCause I'm looking I'm pulling up the numbers right now so if we look at the males age yeah middle age twenty five fifty force pretty much flat over the last three years you know it's up slightly from about ... ... yeah so what about one percent\nWhat does this do to the birth rate the fact that more women are they going back to work because they had kids and they need money to pay for college or are they simply not having kids and that's why there's more women\nI don't know if you can glean enough from this data to be able to say that now you know it's ... it's really hard to be able to say when this is happening just because it ...\nIt's not happening just in the United states either this is going on in Canada Australia in the u._k. women are becoming a much larger percentage of the workforce\nYet in ... and I think again when you have I think the economy is strong enough that you know you have people coming in who are enticed by better job offers that they might have gotten a few years ago but it's also more expensive to run a household\nToday you know you talked sent it to pay for daycare like eight so ... you know like if you want to be if you want to have a kid\nI mean you've got to make a lot of money to justify going back to work for the day is bring your child to work to you know it would not be nice I was just a day care's expensive if you talk to young families about the cost of you know dropping that kid off at the childcare center\nYou better make a lot of it I think I used to be why a lot of

retirement age twenty Nineteen you can earn up to forty six thousand nine twenty in the months prior to turning normal retirement age but if you were in more than that than Social Security withhold one dollar for every three dollars above the limits\nA lot of money a lot of money a U.S shale has a glaring problem this is one this and unfortunately our friends in Saudi Arabia are aware of this yeah we're producing a lot of oil in the United states I think we're we're the largest producer in the world now her for a second largest read\nProbably depends on the given week but we're right in the ballpark yeah problem is we're losing money doing it\nWell it's so here's what's interesting is in particular this was looking at a review of thirty three quote publicly traded oil and gas fracking companies so this is just companies that are involved\nA in oil and gas fracking not companies that are uh you know just have that as a portion of their business but purely ones that do that and what it found um were that these thirty three companies ... they combined three point nine billion dollars in negative cash flow in the first half of twenty Eighteen ...\nNegative cash flow in the short term doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be negative in the long run is that because you get a lot of ... or a law to have a lot of ... they didn't break it out really so it's hard to say where it's coming from ... um but it it's something that I think could be a little bit of a red herring just because\nIt could be that they're just investing a ton of money right now because they think oil prices are going to continue\nTo move up for it and so I'm curious to see what this looks like on a consistent basis just you know obviously we've seen this report here\nWhat was it a year ago what was it two years ago you know is is this something that's changing here you know because companies are adding so much capacity in the U.S right now we've seen us capacity\nGo for about eight and a half million barrels a week up to eleven million or a day rather up to eleven million barrels a day over the last two and a half years it could just be they're adding a ton of capacity and that's what's going on here\nStill a distribution issue ultimately though isn't it they we we either don't have the ports are we don't have the pipelines to get it where we need it because we theoretically we shouldn't be exporting any oil if we had enough pipelines to get where we needed because a lot more profitable to export [noise]\nYeah but you should ever be more ... like if you think about where we can export it to her to export to China why should we have to ship it all the way to China shouldn't it be less expensive to send it to the northeast by pipeline than shipping it to China and a barge\nWhat they think it is less expensive that's why you ship it to China instead because the more profitable because again they're they're China is now the biggest ... oil in the world they have the demand and they don't have the production I understand and they need to be able to pay for\nThis or either going me your your producer because most of our oil is coming from the Permian Basin Texas right oh it's\nIt's scattered I mean you got big deposits now that are showing up in like in Colorado you've got to know her it'll production though is it the largest coming I think that's about thirty percent that's in Texas yeah\nSo you got your biggest slug coming out of there and we're still importing\nBetween what we buy from Canada and in our friends in the middle east we're still importing a good seven million barrels a day yeah so why ... my point is if if you had a distribution system would you really need to be exporting at all but ... what is it wouldn't you be better oh you mean\nBy distribution system pipelines well how do you think the oil is getting to the ports\nIt is truck but ... the ... we can't get natural gas to the northeast and we can't get oil to than or not I guess is a\nDifferent issue so I think when when we look at that gas that's a very separate issue that local to the northeast and and that's because we haven't built the pipelines\nBut if you look at how you know oil flowing around most of the country right now it's it's not a pipeline issue to get it to most places aside from the north east now you know the northeast is an isolated issue but it's of its own making you know they they love because we won't allow the pipelines that's the big thing if you look at the entire rest of the country they don't have the same issue so\nI don't hate coming up we're going to tell you why you should no longer put your vodka in the freezing I thought everybody put their vodka in the freezer has just like what you're supposed to do ... I was wrong right refrigerant America's got vodka and ... that's got to come to a stop we'll talk about next on the financial exchange\nConvinces news is going to break and we're here to break it down and show what it means that your portfolio in the financial exchange with very Armstrong in ... on the financial exchange radio network\nDo have a trust to protect your assets if not I mean they're closing in on retirement messages for you planning for retirement can be complicated so it's best to be with an expert who can advise you on the many elements that will affect the process including how to keep your assets probate and protect them from a nursing home\nYou know five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... what's his name is whether Amtrak station\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nMorning every one meteorologist tons of a nice day today with a cool one mainly sunny sky high temperatures in the upper forties to around fifty four and I are in a mostly cloudy morning load them enough thirty of them are cloudy Kansas I'm showers developing in the afternoon or high temperatures from are on the upper\nForties lower fifties once again and the outlook right now for when they felt mainly cloudy with a chance of a shower to attempt if you can get your weather all day long on something you have that\nFeeling is any part of today's show not Hillary good a financial exchange showed done come and click click click on demand to catch up on every segment you'll also find podcast of all of our shows just financial badly by major league game show gun gum\n\nThree Stooges released their very first short film on may Nineteen thirty four would be the first one hundred Ninety short films at the trio would produce for the studio over a span of twenty five years\nThe winner on our trivia question is Steven from Westboro Steven is taking home a fifty dollar gift certificate to seasons fifty two and was forty three locations nationwide\nIncluding two in the Boston area and one in West Palm Beach seasons fifty two was on a mission in that mission is to provide you with a better way to eat ... seasons fifty two today in Burlington chestnut hill or Palm Beach gardens\nOr go to seasons fifty two dot com for menu information and reservations you can book your holiday party today and get a special gift for all your guests\nSo we know that ... planning to go public\nAnd the suggested market capitalization of the company by the investment bankers is a hundred and twenty billion dollars they have to take that with a grain of salt because it didn't seem like very long ago when they're trying to get rid of Kalanick they we're valuing the company is less than sixty billion right that was last year\nYeah and again you just you go in you take a look at you know all the major auto companies and you know GM is valued at forty three billion dollars right\nNow for added up Ford and GM ... IPO's worth more than both those companies combined\nOr you could add the two of them you could add ... I mean you go down the list and pretty much aside from Toyota there's no one who's anywhere near that market cap you know Toyota is a I Believe one hundred and twenty billion dollar company or somewhere in that ballpark but this is why I think talking about these kinds of evaluations or not or\nIf it's ... whether it's you you we if Samantha try it could be is it a hundred and twenty billion is a\nHundred and ten to ... it's going to be a big number when they go public it's going to be a very very large number next year where do you think they're talking about\nThat's the question because they live here talking crazy numbers they're hoping that Facebook was the same way Facebook when they went public everywhere else\nIt was a suckers that everybody on CNBC and blew over I don't buy it well look at it now somebody you you can't put a face for you can't point to Facebook because they're the exception that proves the rule okay you will get the company like think about every other tech company that that I peeled in the last decade now\nTwitter sucked\nFitbit suck in a way to go who else though is there's no doubt that list like family how do you like everybody uses rubber I mean it's unbelievable how many people had fitbit for like I I get that but that doesn't mean it's worth a hundred and twenty billion dollars like just saying oh like everyone uses this now they don't make money now\nLike the idea but investors believed that they will but that doesn't matter like eventually I had actually matter that they only get the hundred and twenty billion dollar value and how that worked in the tech bubble\nIt depends you know it it it won't try only companies that are better than a lottery ticket\nBut this is the point that I'm trying to make is we're now in the ... at the point where we're comparing this to a lottery ticket you know that's not an investment that gambling well and so I look at it over and everyone says oh this is the future what do they do know what what do they do it it's hard on anyone else\nThe car companies are scrambling the only car company in my estimation that seems to have invested a substantial amount of capital in it and really understands that side of the business is General Motors and their stock is doing a darn thing hit their stocks down\nAnd and that's why I say this isn't worth a hundred and twenty billion dollars if the car companies that are actually doing this aren't getting the same boost got it than all Wall Street selling his crap you\nKnow wouldn't be the first time a cycle is going to change the cycle scores again and having cash in the bank is going to help your credit score which is smart\nYeah pretty much what they're doing is uh they're rolling out a this new method of scoring\nUh in in the next year so we don't have an exact rollout date yet just because we don't have all the information on how this program is going to work um but pretty much a fighter was in discussions with a bunch of lenders\nTo put out what's called the quote ultra psycho score and so what is going to do it's going to take into account cash transactions been happen inside bank accounts as a way to potentially boost up people's credit scores\nPreviously might not qualified for certain types of loans so there's a lot of people that don't use credit cards and when they go to buy a car they pay cash exactly and so those are the people that this is going to target is you know kind of that group that yeah they they're still in the banking system\nBut they don't use a ton of credit products now and because of that they don't have the quote credit history that most other people might have and so this is something that is going to provide a significant boost for those folks\nIf you already have good credit probably doesn't do a ton to help or hurt you either way but if you are someone who hasn't used credited a lot and he really just primarily been using debit cards and cash transactions and things like that\nIt is going to be useful for you if that's the case for you know\nFolks do you have a trust to protect your assets if not and if your closing in on retirement\nAnd this message is for you\nPlanning for retirement can be complicated so it's best to deal with an expert\nWho can advise you on the many elements that will affect the process including how to keep your assets of probate and protect them from the nursing home\nTodd ... he's a partner with a law firm of Cushing and do and he's also an expert an elder law and his new guide out this month\nWill help you understand how to design in irrevocably trust and it'll also include the exact language you need\nIn order to protect your assets from probate and the nursing home the guy does yours by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine pods radio show the legal exchange he always discuss issues that can affect you in later life", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "22"}
