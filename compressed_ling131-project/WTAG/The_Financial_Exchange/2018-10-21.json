{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "\nMovie\n\nNa\n\nOh na\nA\n\nA\n\n\nToday's performance continues the nineties here this historic broker\nPlease join us next time for music and the spoken word\nUntil we need to make peace be with you this day and always\nYeah we do we see\nOr\n\nMaybe the issues\n\nOh let\n\nHunt in Georgia I'm him who's now Fox News the fatal shooting of a police officer with already used in Georgia looking for a teenager officer and want how when he was killed yesterday in ... county\nTodd when you hear the word eerie vote but we're not when you when I hear the word ... but when a lot of people a lot of listeners out there hear the word here evoke of all\nIt's scary or they think that All right I'm I'm putting these assets in a vault they're no longer mine I've got no control and got no power\nIs there anything about these eerie vocal trust that can actually be changed once you've created them\nSo you just sparked two questions in my head when you said that one and and I don't remember if I share the story with you if I did apologize I'm doing it again [noise]\nI have clients that come in with that exact mentality that you just described shared about the irrevocably trust right\nAnd this particular person had worked at Polaroid and retired and came in with that attitude I Can't I Want to do it but I Know we were vocal trust just like you described Susan ... and I said to him\nYou worked at polarized right said yeah I said did they make a camera\nYou said yeah I go to make one camera or did they make\nLots of cameras he said oh we made all kinds of cameras and I said there's all kinds of irrevocably trusts out there and we can't come into these meetings with that preconceived idea about one kind of irrevocably trust and that really helped him understand\nBecause a lot of people they hear little sound bites if you will about different types of very vocal trust and it's not necessarily applicable to these incredible only\nCorrect and so now to answer your question that was one of those sparked in my head enough to answer your question yes there are things that can be changed and the trust and again I think the flexibility is really similar to the flexibility of revoking will trust I mean let's face it\nWhen you want to change or re vocal trust mhm and I have lots of clients with revoke will trust\nThey come in and what do they want to change not paragraph thirty five right of the trust they although they could\nThey come in and say you know what I Want to leave a little more to my grandchildren that I was leaving before them a little bit better than it is cut I leave some there are or I have one child now who's really doing well and one child who's struggling can I leave a little more than one child than another\nWell yeah in the revolt will trust world we make that change for them and that's really all they ever want to change right or maybe the trustee\nWell in your vocal Medicaid trust world they can do those same changes there's a limited powers appointment that allows them to rethink how they leave assets to their children mhm\nMaybe two grandchildren maybe about two one child more than another ... and maybe they want to removing replace the trust of the season changes that they can do even an irrevocably trust yeah so they're really similar mhm not so different\nSo All right so let's just go down the path that someone gets beyond that word eerie vocal and they decide they want to do their trust planning Todd\nAnd they're totally fine putting their primary residence in there so they they fund their trust with their primary residence only but they're still skeptical and fearful that their life will change significantly by having this trust him play and they say I don't want to put any money in the trust now\nAnd then after a year goes by they say hey this is not so bad I Want to put some money you know can they do that and they add money down the road\nYou know it's funny you asked that because I guess clients would think that\nYou know it's just it goes back to that you're a vocal trust mentality where it's etched in stone I went and I\nKnow we just got done explaining some flexibility that exists with these documents but but also we we have the ability to add to the trust so the answer is yes you can and I've had clients who have realized after they put their home and they're like\nWow my life hasn't changed at all mhm I still live there I still pay all my bills my taxes I come and go as I please I could sell a tomorrow if I wanted to and they're like\nI'm really not doing anything right right so that All right well maybe I'll put some money and no\nAbsolutely you can add money to the trust later with one ... one cautionary word when you add additional gifts to the trust\nAnd they're really incomplete gifts or not if but when you put additional assets in the trust you're creating a new five year waiting period but only for that new item okay so if I put today my house and vacation home in\nIn five years that will be protected mhm\nOne year later mhm I add a hundred thousand dollars to the trust from my investment portfolio yes five years from then that will be protected now that sounds like a lot but play out the string\nWhen you get past the initial five years yep the house and the vacation home are now protected mhm well folks\nYou only have one more year to go because the other five your clock was piggybacking around the same time table as the old one okay and so one more year later after the initial five years\nAnd you're protected the hundred thousand so it's not so bad just be mindful of how old you are when you make that\nYeah and certainly your health you want to put as much as you can end up front when you're initially funding it but I Know that it can you can add more later on folks you know what these very vocal trust work but they have to be drafted properly\nTaught is

from our website\nLegal extreme showed dive ...\nListening to the legal exchange and it's done for us this and we were done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that's including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nTaught him if you questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Brenda in Hampton New Hampshire and Brenda writes I Am Seventy nine years old single and I own my own home and a rental property my total net worth is around eight hundred and fifty thousand\nI Do not have any children although I Do have a few nieces that I'm close to and will likely leave my state to them when I pass would it make sense for me to create a trust at this point\nI Do have a five year long term care policy that has increased to about three hundred and Seventy five dollars per day so I'm not concerned with nursing home costs would that be the only reason for me to create a trust\nWell let's just isn't this is great because this is the kind of question almost like when we've talked to people and done shows on how to get started wanting to look for what kind of plan is right for me and I think that's really what brand is asking right here\nUm and so everybody listen to this fact pattern in and and put yourself in it and see if this applies to you\nFirst of all I I see you're under a million\nDoesn't really matter because you're in New Hampshire resident so there's no federal there's no state to state tax you don't need our help for that\nTrust will at least help you avoid probate I see the rental property the ...\nAnd there's really no way to avoid probate what those items\nA short of putting another person's name on and which I don't want you to do other than a trust so again revoked ... or your vocal bowl will get you there okay in terms of avoiding probate and and then the rest of your\nBank accounts or investment accounts I Would also put in the trust that we create\nAnd just back up for one second time because the the point you made about avoiding probate if she didn't create created trust now\nHer executive her niece who never would have to go through probate and I would venture to guess that for an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar estate it would cost them more to go through probate than to set up a trust to begin with\nI Would think that's the case yeah sure and it's not just the cost which is certainly there and and the evident\nUh but the headache yeah at the time can consumption or you know why bother\nWith that if I don't have to yeah when you could go just sit in the lawyers conference room and pull out the estate planning and let him or her explain you know what the next steps are and how the assets you know and it's all private ... I I think that in of itself enough\nReason why people would want to re not do that so\nAll right so now I've I've got to the point where if avoiding probate is one of your concerns than that and that's your only concern that a revolt ... trust will get you there you don't need the irrevocably trust 'em now also the revolt ... trust\nWill allow you to direct how when when your nieces and nephews get the assets ... and\nAnd and that's important because you know maybe you want a divorce proof for for them maybe you want to credit are protected for them maybe there's things you want to do with these assets to protect them or to control them from the grave and the ... trust in this example will do that now when you were a vocal trust would do that as well\nBut I'm Still kind of focused on the revolt couple so those would be too important reasons probate and how to get it to them maybe help excluded from their state first they tax purposes as well as skip a generation maybe control it for the uh great nieces and nephews as well\nAnd if she doesn't have any plan in place right now including a well\nAssets those wouldn't land with her niece's they will go to a different succession plan right well\nI'm not really sure if you don't have a well you're you're you're correct you'd have to look to the interstate succession statute in it might be they would go to the next closest next of kin which\nYou know probably not parents if she's Seventy nine but that would be next right then it would be siblings so the fact that she's got nieces and nephews were telling me that she does have siblings and unless they predict sister\nUm than\nThose assets we'll go to siblings first right and you're never really want to leave it across a generation you always want to leave it down a generation to save taxes\nAnd not to mention her siblings are probably the same age that she is in maybe have\nIs Yahoo's nursing homes you know it could be a nursing home issue in the last comment would be why not do that your vocal trusts well she does have a decent amount of long term care insurance live coverage which I think is helpful number one not enough to cover the full boat\nBut again having no immediate children her immediate need might not be all yeah it's very important that I save assets from the nursing home for my nieces and nephews more you know whatever's left they can have\nWell if that's the case then you don't coupled with the long term care insurance I'd probably be leaning towards the revolt couple of trust plan for her to hang up based on this this fact\nBut some type of trust plan Brenda because you want to avoid probing you want to make sure those assets go where you want them to folks if you are considering creating any or evoke about trusting you're not sure really what you should be looking for when you sit down with the attorney that's going to draft your documents\nTodd has created a guide for the month of October it's entitled designing and income only ... trust and it includes six provisions that absolutely must be in your ear evoke about trust and six provisions that absolutely must not\nBe included it's a great baseline to educate yourself on how these trust work folks\nYou can request year free copy of Todd's designing your ear even a couple of trust guide\nBy calling eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nTaught our last question comes from Donna in reading and math and gun rights what does Medicaid consider fair market value when selling a home\nWould it be the assessed value I'd like to purchase my mother's home from her and she is willing to sell it to me at a discount however I don't want to run into any issues down the road as she is in failing health\nDon I'm going to start off by saying I'm not loving the idea of you buying the whole right I mean can you buy the home and in fact I I had a student in my class asked a similar question\nWhat is fair market value and you know what if you sell the home right before you go to the nursing home is that going to be a disqualifying transfer if I sell it for fair market value or if I sell it for less than fair market value\nWell certainly if you do anything in terms of transferring assets and not get back fair market value it will be a disqualifying transfer mhm so that's number one", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "21"}
