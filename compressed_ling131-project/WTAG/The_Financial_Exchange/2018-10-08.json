China trade fears et cetera are only forty six percent of global executives over the next twelve months are planning to\nBuy or merge with another company which is pretty low in terms of historically what we've seen\nYet temp down by ... percentage points from a year earlier so that's you know definitely a dramatic\nShift or of course you know you have seen a you know a lot of big deals going through the sky deal Comcast coming in to pick them up a bear and Monsanto\nYou know at some point you sort of wonder just how many deals are they're left out there to do I mean I suppose every single day there's some deal to do but you know if we've come through a period of a really aggressive em an a and you know if we knew the answer to this we\nMake a billion dollars you know we'll things are in the economy in the stock market be better twelve months from now than they are now I think you know there's a reason to to have doubts about how much longer kind of the good times we've seen can keep going\nYeah certainly I mean that that is a risk I you know the big executive uh cited regulation and geo political uncertainty as the biggest risks and concerns they have to deal making\nYou know and the other side is some of the theory is hey if you're gonna be heading into a period of slowing or you know economic recession you want to be big and you have some consolidation so you can whether that storm so two sides of the coin but\nA clearly a lot of geo political and economic uncertainty out there and you're seeing is this is one of those early indicators that we see out there you know if people aren't willing to shell out cash for other companies\nThat begins to become a concern when compiled with other issues\nAnd sort of another version of that is are people waiting and thinking some people are gonna get beaten up and the next twelve to twenty four months and you might be able to make better deals in twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nDerby not to mention you know probably costs you another one or two percent in interest to borrow the money to acquire these companies now so that doesn't help either [noise]\nSwitching gears a little bit away from China\nAlthough probably a lot of these things were a manufactured in China the retailer mattress from going bankrupt over the over the weekend match for him which operates over three thousand stores across the country declaring bankruptcy sounds like ... seven hundred locations going dark almost immediately\nHave you ever seen anybody going into or walking out of a mattress from I went into one once uh\nI actually don't remember if it was a mattress firmer one of the new identical other stores that sell mattresses it seems like there's twenty on every street corner that you ... that you see and you know any of the major cities I'm\nA yeah it it it was a weird place um the number of people that are buying mattresses on line now and the number of expansions that that that this company had done just didn't seem to add up to me yeah it is not terribly surprising that I'm seeing this company going out of business\nBecause I go by a couple of every day and this got me thinking about I've never seen anybody going into a mattress store and you know these days or what a better product to ... get it delivered to your house lie down on it if you don't like a return it\nYeah so I my my wife bought one of these uh online matched I don't remember which company she used it as a group on deal five years ago we ordered it we actually really liked it but\nThinking about that ... that return process that wouldn't be very pleasant if we had to return it I mean first off you had to hold that two hundred pound box up three flights of stairs and tourists out the apartment south Boston apartment that was miserable [noise] um\nAnd then if we had to bring that same back down I genuinely don't know how we would have done it ... it might have involved a chainsaw and a window\nAnd so I see the appeal to buying them ashes on line and clearly a lot of people are doing it because they're sending companies like mattress from right out of business on that actually brings me to our poll questions today which is up on financial exchange show dot com you can\nVote I Want to see how many people\nAre not even if you have purchased in ... but you know anyone who is bought an actress on line because I think you know most of our listeners probably going to say no to this is not a purchase you make frequently\nBut do you know anyone who has bought a mattress on line on it yet because my wife to tend to have you bought a matched on line you know anyone who has other about a nationalized go\nRight to Jordan's or something like that last last matched up I was like two years ago I just wanted to Jordan's and they deliver to former you pay more though I may you pay more for Jordan's mattress then you will on an online retail I I think you can save thirty forty percent\nBy going for one of these on line mattress companies from what I've heard and then you have the nightmare of getting it up to the third floor the south the apartment yeah yeah that that was pretty much had\nYour friends over and then uh gotten them a pizza\nAnd we were not available as they used to be paid to have you bought a national I Am not a ...\nA ... in fact it makes me wonder I think that

on friday\nAbout how few European countries were trying to get around the new U.S sanctions that were placed on but\nMost of the European companies a big you know ... a French oil company and most of the banks won't touch it because the second they know that they you know they defy one of these us sanctions and they're going to be pretty much prohibited from doing business with any US Bank\nUm but India\nHas said that they are going to continue to import the oil from the from the Iranians India the third largest ah oil importer in the world\nI Will be very interested to see how you know who won the White House react to this yeah this will not go over very well\nNow it probably won't do generally speaking what we've done with other countries is you know will allow them to wean themselves off of Iranian oil as long as they commit to not importing anymore going forward so you know bring those Iranian oil imports down to zero that doesn't seem to be with India saying\nHere there's an interesting uh Pete line in the CNBC story about this uh India Iran oil situation\nOr the very end of the story they say some energy marketing analyst expecting around five hundred thousand barrels per day to disappear once us sanctions against Iran come into force while others have warned as much as two million barrels per day could come up line in other words experts have no idea what's going to happen and you know how much of these\nSanctions going to bite and how much can Iran cheat and who's going to college with them\nOils always just seeps out of the country they you'd put sanctions on there you try and get it you know to stay in the country and not get export it always finds a way out it's always pretty sketchy but it always does seem to find a way out\nI probably will see a price impact I mean you've already seen a bit of a price impact on rising price of oil because of this\nMy concern centers around how these countries are going to do it because if China if Russia if India if parts of Europe get together and say hey we're going to you know forget about the United states new sanctions or there was a deal in place and we're going to abide by the prior deal\nAnd still do business with Iran\nThen they would have to do so in a currency other than the u._s. dollar\nAnd that's my concern is yeah this is just one independent scenario here but right now\nEverything is traded in dollars oil being the main thing I everybody pays dollars for oil if all of a sudden you get that to change and suddenly people are paying you know Chinese run for for oil that could have a big ripple effect down down the line as\nMaybe the u._s. dollar gets replaced as the default currency for trait that would be really very concerned\nIt's an awfully good thing when you're currencies the world's reserve currency\nKnew that maybe we are we are the most reliable currency out there\nAnd I don't think that this one event is going to change that you know this one event in Iran is not going to completely change that but when you compound this with potentially other issues down the road that's where you could have some concerns about you know will the u._s. currency will the dollar still be in the same place a decade from now\nCompared to where it is today that I don't know it might be nothing but uh it it raises some concern\nWe had a big election uh over the weekend on Sunday in Brazil there was a very very big election\nOr with a ultra conservative candidate B. A. comparisons to Donald Trump or who you know came away with a big portion of the vote she did not win the election that Brazil does elections a little bit differently\nThey have a big election with all the uh all the people running and then if nobody gets fifty percent then there's a runoff so we're heading to a runoff but it looks like they're going to be a big shift the power in Brazil\nWell and things are are just such a mess down there in terms of you know a level of debt up to you know eighty percent of GDP\nIn debt and the government spending I appreciated this until I read this morning two thirds of the budget in Brazil goes for old age pension is public health care and the payroll of the public sector by twenty twenty that's going to be the entire budget there's no money left for schools roads highways\nYou know it's just sort of out of control so you can see where a a you know a ...\nComes from in terms of people being fed up with a you know getting whacked with taxes to pay for a colossal government sector\nYes at ... I think it's ... and narrow as former army captain is pretty much being going up against the the leftist Fernando ... died in the left working party has been in control in Brazil for I think a decade or more\nA nobody down I I spent a fair bit of time in Brazil nobody in their has any faith in their government and rampant corruption for years and years and years\nAnd bad economic ... place right now no one exporter Brazil hardworking Brazilians\nLook clean my house yeah ... you're right it it it's it's not a good economy down there and that's it for this hour the financial exchange ah coming up we've got a few different guests a ... from the economist and ... road show stay tuned here the financial exchange radio network\n[noise]\nHi this is Barry Armstrong and I know that many of you who listened to my show are retired or nearing retirement age if you don't have a sound financial plan to allow you to enjoy your retirement you need to get my brand new guy on how to develop a\nRetirement income strategy guide will help you understand various elements that are critically important to your plan whenever you save today has to last for the rest of your life\nSo you're going to want that money to continue to grow over time even when you start drawing from it another consideration is the volatility in the stock market we've seen the bull market continue to flourish but\nThere have been many considerable ups and downs along the way so you need to make sure your portfolio can handle that called me right now at eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one and get your free guy how to develop a retirement income strategy that eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one where you can download it right now on our website Armstrong advisory dot com\nI had to correct myself by the way markets were flat about Fifteen minutes ago right now the Dow is down about Seventy points as in P. off seven\nNASDAQ off forty five points so down and are asking the down about a quarter of one percent the NASDAQ off about more than half a percent that would make a three day losing streak of this comes to fruition so so far pretty rough October uh\nIn addition to earnings though you know the big backdrop that we have other than earnings of the terrorists is interest rates so the ten year treasury yields\nIs now up you know pretty far above three percent read three point two three three percent on the tenure treasury as we all know that impacts everything that we do now you go get a car loan you get a mortgage any of these things are going to be impacted by the ten year treasury rate and that's been on the move really since the end of the summer\nWhen I was amazed to see it jumped Fifteen basis points last week zero point one five percent um and you know in the in the Snootzie world a bond trading you know that's a ethic until you have a move that big in one week and you know as you pointed out have really been around two point eight percent for most of the summer so [noise]\nYou know it it's one of those sort of bad news good news thing because to me the reason the interest rates going up is because the economy's doing well and the fed can raise the interest rate and um you know we're seeing some uh I Would say for now fairly positive signs of inflation growth\nSo you know uh every uh every piece of economic data you can argue is good or bad\nYeah I mean we did get so we got a a jobs report on friday and you know the reiterated incredibly low unemployment rate we're down to three point seven percent unemployment a\nWage growth was up at an annual I's rate of two point eight percent but it's been accelerating so it's the ... rates to point eight percent but if you look at the last\nQuarter by quarter we've been getting faster and faster here so I think there are some legitimate concerns that the fed has about inflation or as as you see interest rates and that's the reaction is they're moving up interest rates but\nWage growth is the big one that we've been looking at and uh if there's one thing that I think you really need to keep the stock market and the U.S economy afloat for another few years it's going to be it's gonna be coming from the consumer\nIt's got to come from the American consumer make it a little bit more money and spending that money on things like cars like toys like all that ah you know all that useless junk and we don't need but that keeps our economy floating Seventy percent of the economy you and me and everybody spending a so speaking of interest rates\nLast decade you know if you wanted to go buy a new car you can get a pretty sweet deal on financing zero percent financing deals really came about right after the ... the great recession all these car companies said well we got to sell these car somehow so how do we do get 'em in with zero percent financing lot harder to find these days\nWhen I was amazed when you started seeing you know zero percent for one year three years or ... you know great deal but when you start seeing Seventy two month zero interest loans I mean that's really a the ... the lender taking a major risk about what's the future going home\nYeah I mean I Would do is Seventy two months a loan on a car if I had zero percent but you really got to think about what is it don't don't just sign up for one of these car payments people Seventy two months loan yeah those payments are really small\nHow how often do you have to replace a car before Seventy two months goes by I mean I I Try and drive my car is into the ground but a if you do a fair bit of driving in a pretty good chance you're gonna have to replace that car for six years goes by yeah\nAnd then you've got a big uh you know or you gets totaled and\nThe honor wander on that car pretty quickly yeah\nI'm ... those deals are going away if you see is zero percent financing deal on a car uh usually it's for a couple of reasons one that's just something that can't sell any more so\nYou're ... you're still seeing some of these deals on you know smaller size sedan that just aren't selling very well right now you know everybody wants to small SUV sedans just aren't really going to they're putting some decent financing deals on those\nUm but they're really by and large have gone away that zero\nFinancing well these Judy power numbers or two years ago nine point one percent of all new cars could sold with the zero interest loan now is just three point four percent and even you know a talking about the effect of\nInterest rates percentage of cars funniest with an interest rate of one percent or lower uh that's just five point three percent a and that was never there was a Levin point seven percent September twenty six teams are definitely people you know I'm digging deeper into the\nWallet to pay for a new car\nYeah I did I just bought a spotted minivan or about a month ago because I've had my third kid and so I jumped on that bandwagon I think my my interest rate on their cars over three percent now for only forty eight months alone so\nYou're saying it interest rates are moving up if you're trying to lock in a mortgage or anything like that I don't think they're going down anytime soon edge seems to be like it's going in just one direction\nI Would say the mini van is like a colonoscopy nobody wants to have one but you get to that point in life when

covering your health insurance that's pretty simple uh it's not trying to not someone trying to figure out what's covered in how much is going to cost but at least you know what you're expected the pay is pretty simple but with the rollout of the Affordable CARE Act and then\nThe you know the changes that were made the Affordable CARE Act a law has been changing over the last few years and now there's these almost like gap\nInsurance policies that you can go out there and by short term short term insurance they're you know they were designed to really only cover insurance for a period of three months if you're in between jobs or something like that\nUm but they are now being sold on a longer term basis they can be really cheap you know as much as fifty to eighty percent cheaper than plans available and Affordable Care act but as we're learning ... they are you know specifically very different from what we think of as your typical health insurance plans\nAnd I mean they're completely terrible this a screw that we're looking at from or CNBC you know ten thousand dollar deductibles coverage of pre existing conditions no prescription drug\nCoverage no subsidies uh you know you can't renewed them to you go from one provider to another and I get to the end of the story and I said you know why would you even pay for the coverage in the first place it seems like you're better off just not even going totally uncovered\nI think what this type of thing I disagree with you a little bit there I mean what if you really do your research what this is covering you for is somebody that says hey I don't want health insurance but if I have a heart attack I don't want to go bankrupt they basically just saying if if you have to have an emergency really expensive procedure it's going to cover that\nBut it's going to have a pretty much nothing else as a your pre existing conditions you won't even be approved for the health insurance and the first place so don't worry about it\nUm it doesn't cover prescription drugs largely a sky high deductible Jerry talked about that a ten thousand dollars duck doubles\nThe other thing I didn't realize though so if you buy one of these policies and then it expires because they're you know three months policies you can't just go back and buying Affordable Care act policy if you get rid of one of these policies you have to wait until the open enrollment period\nA which is actually one they come here yeah um the other thing too is there's subsidies available a if you're in an Affordable Care act policy these types do not offer subsidies\nSo you do it it's tough these days you really do need to research this I actually talked to a guy or just last week who is running a small business she had been in corporate America for years\nStarted a small business really you know the the politics of the Affordable CARE Act really rubbed in the wrong way so he just wasn't carrying any health insurance up until that point and it didn't really it it didn't really seemed to click like\nYeah I mean if I if I get in a car accident uh if I you know if something like out in LA I'll lose my house I'll lose anything that I have because you know any visit to the emergency room these days costs thousands of dollars um yeah I I hadn't had a client who had a heart transplant\nThe built in the insurance companies one and a half million dollars wow\nWhat would you do if you I mean if you didn't have health insurance area you're just toast ... and he was in the hospital for two months are all sorts of prescriptions and that's the other thing right you know yeah this will cover the heart transplant the basic insurance policies but how about all the prescriptions that you have to be on to the rest of it\nYour life that and this this health insurance is going to cover all that\nYeah the interesting to see the the last time we saw at the end of twenty sixteen they're about a hundred and sixty thousand people in America who had a these short term uh coverage plans will be interesting to see the the updated number you know it's just getting to maybe five hundred thousand or or even a million now\nThe penalty goes away now you don't have to pay a penalty if you don't have health insurance so I think a lot of people are gonna drop off and it's a big bill ... if if you earn a decent let's say you're a small business owner you're you know just a independent contractor and you make a decent wage you're for you know a decent Affordable Care act policy you're shelling out\nEight hundred thousand bucks a month for just an individual family plan two thousand four hundred yeah it's big big money I get why people don't have insurance it's really really costly but are you really need to think through the implications if you're not going to carry health insurance\nFolks do you have a trust to protect your assets if not in your closing in on retirement this messages for you\nPlanning for a time it can
