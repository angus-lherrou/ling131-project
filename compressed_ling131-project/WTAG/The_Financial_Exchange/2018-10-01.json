Tesla is hemorrhaging cash if you on must have had not gotten this settlement ... there was a problem with you know is that company going to exist GE he does not have a problem of have this company going to exist they will that they're not going to go out of business so we don't need to get you know to that point\nBut GE he does have a case where hey if you want to have a future where you're growing and you can attract top talent you got to lay out a vision to get there and\nOne thing flattery never did and and I was critical ... what are you going to do like what's going to be that killer what's your age you have that no one else can do\nWe never got an answer to that he never message we never got an answer to that question it was just well we are going to go through a strategic ...\nTell me what you want to do what you want to do what do you want to be good at\nIran Musk wants to make cars and he settled quite surprisingly on Saturday we're the spirit of conversation about Tesla and Ilan Musk on friday\nAnd hey Chuck may have been questioning his sanity for turning down to deal with the SEC especially now when you look at the terms of the original offer from the SEC I think it was very generous\nWhat it was it was going to be a ten million dollar fine and he was going to have to step away is the chairman of the board for two years what now happens is that he has to pay twenty million dollar fines of twice as big\nTesla has to pay a twenty million dollar fine as well now that find becomes four times as big he gets an additional year away from being the chairman of the board so he's got a three year ban on that position and he also has to have\n... ... and quite literally Twitter supervision ... they need someone to supervise him when tweeting\nOr you're going to maybe ... maybe he could share somebody with the president you know the president could have ... ... ... it's not a fulltime job right have you seen that much you on the streets [laughter] he won't be too much now\nBut uh so you will get this and this takes off the table I think the worst case scenario for Tesla which was that they can't fundraise and they're out of business by near the spring they still have some hurdles to clear\nBut look this company as a going concern probably is not something that is you know imminent and that this company is going out of business but\nThey still have to figure out how to make cars profitably they still have to figure out you know if they have the demand every year for four hundred thousand vehicles um and\nThen you know just on who they might bring in ... if you heard anything on the rumor before which are the the chair words eats that open up or the chairman heroin role\nThat's an important job 'cause it's got to be somebody who's strong enough there's got to be very intelligent and they have to be able to stand up the mosque and say no you're not doing\nHow do you think they need to be from this world the the kind of start up high tech world you\nKnow I think I mean I think they need to spring manufacturing guy in the like uh somebody from Boeing um what was the guy that ran for for years uh McNally uh um the mole alley Malawi allowing it can be a good fit their you know somebody that mosque would respect\nBut understands the automobile business and supply chains and and manufacturing because that's\nTheir big issues they make it seem to remember about Tesla is they make a car in which there is a waiting list you want to buy a Tesla Model S remodeled three there's a waiting list that shows that they've got a good product\nThe problem is they have not been executing and yet somebody who's been proven winner in that capacity below all he's probably too old he's got to be close to eighty now\nI question though the waiting list though there who are way they're still not making cars for thirty five thousand there's been a lot of people turning turning down the ability to get all your a waiting list because the only ones they're selling or forty five thousand an up and people are saying look I don't you can't get why didn't want to buy a fifty two thousand dollar ... but you still can't get a fifty two thousand dollar watch go out\nGo out to next fall a year from now\nI don't know if you have much of a waiting list and and and that's the question that I always had his okay great you're going to sell five hundred thousands of these\nDo you have the demand for five hundred thousand more every year right 'cause that's what they were saying and and I I question that because when you look at the vehicles people are buying today the most popular vehicles out there aren't the Toyota Corolla and the camera and the Honda Accord and the Ford Fusion\nIt's not what people were buying today right people were buying route fours they're buying Honda see RVs\nThey're buying Nissan rogues and Tesla doesn't offer anything that competes with those anywhere near that\nPrice explain what this nine hundred and twenty million dollar convertible bond coming due in March is this is a big one has this\nYou know I think what may have happened I think I think he won must probably really wanted to fight the SCC and and I think what may have happened is the financial ramifications of that fight may have dawned on him because he's worth what twenty thirty billion dollars in that ballpark but much of it is tied up in Tesla's stock\nIt is I think he probably recognize that she you\nKnow this stock could go to twenty bucks a share in which case I'm wiped out in terms of my network\nSo here's the big funding question that test will has has they have this nearly nine hundred or nearly billion dollar convertible bond that comes due in March what's a convertible bond so pretty much the way it works if the stock is above a certain price\nIt simply converts into stock and they don't have to roll over and repay that debt they don't have to write a check for no they don't ... it comes it comes to knock and boom you don't have to worry about you know refinancing ...\nIf it is below a certain price though that that does effectively expire and they have to go and raise capital in order to pay that off in his shoe new debt\nThat's a tough but that means they have to raise their prices their stock is up sixteen percent today Chuck and in order to avoid writing the check it has to go to three hundred and sixty bucks\nYeah so there are three o seven to share right now they've got to get north of three sixty effectively in order for this to convert equity and for them to not have to raise additional capital it's it's a real question I've been talking about this for about six months now if the stock is below that price it's going to be a little bit of a challenge for them to raise that\nCapital speculation guy you know you get you get a chairman who's an adult right yet is Sheryl Sandberg somebody that that can run in and work with the lawn\nAnd then you get another investor yet apple that says well we're going to buy a hundred billion dollars worth of the stock and and we're going to be a big player in tests or we're going to allow hundred billion dollars companies only worth fifty\nYeah ... a hundred well let's see how they buy chunk of Tesla right enough to get control the board how it wouldn't cost that wouldn't have much\nWouldn't happen went up to you on still controls so much of the company he's still got thirty percent of the company [noise] yeah but he's his powers been neutered [noise]\nSomewhat you know it's again this is this is a it's a slightly big deal but it's like there's not a whole lot that is going to change here in my opinion we watch a couple of new boards like I look at it and I I go you won't get off lightly just chairman\nOh he did get a very lightly but the chairman role I think is is really going to be interesting to watch I I if they do that right\nThen that could be a ... that could spell success for the company 'cause it would also it would a lay the fears of investors they'd say okay would you eat we got it right we got a ... type person in there or\nDo you got to get someone who's going to come in and not take any crap from Milan right and and that's going to be it's gonna be tough to find because you on is he you know whether you like him or hate him he's for medical you know most\nPeople don't like in the most people don't like working with him\n[noise] yeah it it it is you still get is executive director of just going to be interesting to see who they can get to come in and fill that role because it's\nIt's a tough task up next we'll be talking about what used to be called NAFTA it's no longer called NAFTA everything is thinking about changing the name to parks and tacos\nWhat about the United

I Would say I would think automobile manufacturing myself you know maybe you're bringing a German I like I even though he was and\nI Will get it also do you know that's the first place that you look what are the issues with Tesla all manufacturing related\nI think a lot of them I think they've got great innovation in terms of their product right so I don't think you have to ... I I don't think people are going to say well the the products terrible ... I think you have to say how do we make the product I mean I looked at the head count to build a Tesla versus the headcount to build a Cadillac there\nAnd it was a multiple check I think it was like sixteen or Seventeen people touched every Tesla and I think it was four or five people were touching every Cadillac because the other tests all his\nBiggest problem right now is credibility I think that as as big if not a bigger problem than the manufacturing it's just because they they've always had manufacturing issues always\nRight but yet like in order to be profitable you have to overcome those you've got to bring your expenses down they only have one facility that they manufacture from I I think it's just how\nComplex their vehicles are you know when you when you design you know an SUV that instead of having normal doors they open you know these ... it's like what the heck are you that was a dumb design decision but that's but again that's not a manufacturing problem that's why we decided we wanted to say okay we need to be that cool like they got a credibility problem they\nWhat they've never delivered a single product on time and under budget I Know never\n[noise] why more Social Security recipients will see a real raise in twenty Nineteen we're estimating that the raise is going to be what two and a half to three percent friend somewhere in that ballpark yeah so that means if the average payment\nIs fourteen hundred dollars ego three percent already five bucks yeah they you know the the unknown is\nIs how much Medicare part B and Medicare part D as in David will increase this year plus your met a gap coverage ... is typically a retiree is paying Medicare part B\nA there and at least Medicare part D as in David so how if those two premium increases are modest then maybe they'll be okay [noise] yeah\nIt's it's it's likely going to be the case that additional Medicare premiums eat up a chunk of that extra forty five dollars might be anywhere from a third to half of it then you get an extra twenty five bucks a month\nHey maybe your met a gap policy eats up a decent chunk of that as well so you might end up getting an extra ten to Fifteen bucks a month when he finally met it out right it's not a lot\nRight well we are those announces when we get the I think it's in October that we get the Medicare\nAn outside so leave so I don't know the exact date that we get them I think it's it's not as ... to four weeks yeah now right\n[laughter] a red ink floods vi peel market this is a danger sign for stocks in my estimation more than eighty percent Chuck\nOf us lifted initial public offerings and this year the first three quarters involve companies that lost money in the twelve months leading up to their debut so just think about it you're you're getting all excited about buying stock in\nCompanies going public and I and you know a lot of ... come to mind because of where we're located but eighty percent of them are losing money we haven't seen numbers like this in a long time\nKnow in in this speaks to a fundamental change that we've seen in markets in the last decade um because this this is different from what we've seen previously there there's always some companies that IPO's when they're losing money I mean it's part of the game like occasionally you see that\nBut what's interesting now is it's not just that you have companies that are losing money as they go public or\nYou have companies that go public and then don't make profits for a year now okay and you can go through the list you can go down and talk about Tesla you could talk about sales force dot com and talked about linked to you you can go through a lot of these you know highly you know highly publicized companies and\nCan come November\nAnd

exchange showed John gum while you're there by our immediate player and watch the show while your financial exchange radio network\n\nWhile retirement may not be too far away for you and I saw an article by Lorrie Cornish tens CNBC they talked about retirees going back to school good morning Lorrie welcome to the show\nThat morning thank you so what ah why would a retiree you after they've wound down their career ended up going back to college at the conclusion of their working career\nWell many retirees who are you know having unfair is harming today are active they are looking to stay engaged in one of the ways they can do that is by continuing their education\nSo it turns out that there's many options for someone who's looking at the that and the good news is that it doesn't have to cost a fortune\n... immigrants out yes some schools actually allows seniors to audit the classes free of charge that the\nCommunity colleges there are programs that are available that yeah yeah\nAnd what's this ... program though I was reading the if the ... actually Berkshire community college ... shirt lifelong learning Institute\nThe ocean or lifelong learning and ... is a network of one hundred twenty kids colleges and universities across the country\nThat received grant during that Bernard a shirt foundation mhm and it's really lifelong learning programs that\nAllow you to become a number and then take classes throughout the years so these are classes that you know a membership at Berkshire for example around sixty dollars annually or a membership and then ... ... dollars are class so it's really a fraction of the costs that someone might\nPay if they were you know going back to school to after the early ... these are programs that where you're not doing that but you're engaging in learning and you know ... people\n... when I was in college I remember a number of my professors were retired CEOs I went to business school and they were you know the retired CEO of maybe Kodak or something like that\nAre you seeing colleges and universities embrace retirees as professors are instructors\nAt these lifelong learning in it um it many times to get inside of the teachers so they are engaged in planning the programming and that kind of teachers and they also you know encourage mentor ship so if\nYou're someone who's a retired lawyer for example they might help you connect with someone who wants to pursue that career so that you can provided by to them and sort of help them along as they curse career\nVery interesting that sounds like this is the future of retirement continue going back to college\nAnd it sounds like a lot of fun for the people I talk to you know there was a woman who had a\nCareer and theater and was able to continue to not only teach her arm\nAnother woman who had to retire earlier than she thought and because of the medical condition but was able to really engage by\nUm you know taking classes and tell me she would have been ... at that had she not found out that others had met and and your spouse is through the program um people really get very involved in finding a community a way that they're able to get that\nDo you have to join a fraternity\nNow no and you don't have to join a fraternity guy although I'm sure if you were a member\nOf Kennedy and that fraternity exist on the campus that you um you know are taking classes on you probably can connect with them as well\nYeah no they just like a homecoming right they go to hold you see all the old guys come back to the frat house so thank you very much for your time or appreciate it when you've done what would you call the uh the geriatric fraternity you could have a special name for\nIt they already made a movie about this with\nAll your but boy blue [laughter] I don't\nReally green blue is like when you were like eighty nine as Obama ... died in the movie that could happen and you could happen\nOr pull question today is do you think oil will hit one hundred dollars per barrel by January thirty first of next year\nI I don't know it's that that seems like a lot for it to go where where's the oil now eighty four it's another big January thirty

way is the ... you think about\nUh you know the the er the advent of electric cars they use a lot of copper though I'm more copper and those products you think housings pretty strong but evidently they may be manufacturing is not as strong as we were led to believe\nI think the uh the big thing when you look at who uses the most cop or is it is China\nUm they account for about half of the world's copper demand largely because of all the construction that's going on there and China's growth has been slowly over the last couple of years exacerbated a little bit this year by the trade war going on between the U.S and China we've talked about the impact\nThat these terrorists have on the Chinese economy simply because they export so much to the United states and I think that's been a key reason why you're seeing some slack and in demand in ... uh cycling topper demand coming from China in this case yours is a good point do you\nCall it the cash in China manufacturing purchasers index sure okay sure um it's heavily weighted towards small private firms that fell to fifty from fifty one in August ending Fifteen straight months of expansion\nYeah fifty means that it's

down it's heading\nThere you know it it certainly is heading there and and that's you know when when you fall from fifty one to fifty and saying hey we're going from growth neutral\nThe next step there and you've seen this you know you've seen this now for a couple of months was slowing in these numbers you wouldn't be surprised if you start to see contraction in a couple of areas and there were some a trial balloons floated by the Chinese central bank\nOver the last couple of days saying hey we're ready to step in with monetary policy if need be in order to keep things they'll float here what does that mean\nAre unclear at this point are historically when you talk about what it means with regards to China it's a lot more with um the reserve ratios and things along those lines than necessarily changing interest rates are packed to the dollar any any ways\nBut it might just be hey you don't need to keep as much in reserve from may lending perspective you can lend a little bit more in order to encourage a little bit\nMore ... if China is slowing down wouldn't that logically lead to a decrease in the price of oil because demand for oil would go down\nIn ... in theory yes but I don't think that you have the I I think the mechanics of the oil market are changing and\nI think that we are entering into a phase where over the next five to ten years the world is going to go

it's been for the last twenty five years you're going to see two separate ... you are seeing two separate blocks developing between the U.S and China and come in countries that fall in line behind them\nBut the those countries whether they're behind China or whether the behind the United states are still consume oil\nExcept what currency is purchased it does make a difference you know if if you use the ... and I think you are going to see a shift where countries\nThat do not have their long term strategic interests linked with the U.S are going to move more towards the Chinese side of things
