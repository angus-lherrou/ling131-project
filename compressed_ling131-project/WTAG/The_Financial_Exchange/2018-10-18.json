difference at a no no no I'm not the top one percent but they said it's crumbs robots crumbs how is it creating the budget deficit here's what the\nProblem is and it's a problem with Republicans and

these old cars in Cuba\nWe were scrounging for parts for our US military fryer gets\nUnder the Obama administration\nAnd now we have to rebuild that so I look at it like this we have a spending problem just like just like the regular person the government is no different let's say you get a raise\nPeople always seem to find a way to spend commensurate with that raise and they're still financially in the same position instead of taking that money in\nAnd applying it to debt they're putting some away for a rainy day we\nWrite the government isn't a person but it behaves like a

got to put a new roof on and then when we strip off the old shingles we find out oh wow water getting we got to replace some of the boards some of the plywood and that's what the military was\nSo

Democrat Jim McGovern drained joining me now Republican Tracy live or good morning Tracy morning Jim hey so nice to have you in the studio thank you and me I say I appreciate it\nUm I think you win the soundbite contest for Monday Night and I think a lot of people lab repeated it why don't you share with folks that the little exchanges you out with congressman McGovern\nWell you know it was just so upsetting because when I was\nTalking about real problems real issues here in West are and how\nThe surrounding areas it's really thriving yet here in West are are poverty rate has increased um how we're making national\nAttention for an extreme poverty level and those are happening under his watch ... um and instead of showing concern for western you know he got very defensive and and blame me for trashing his city\nUm and of course they do I doubt them back with no you trust your city\nUm but you know at that and it did make a great soundbite\nBut honestly what about the concern for the problems in western yelled absolutely no concern\nWell he's more concerned about third world countries and as I said he's in he's in Boston today meeting with the Cuban ambassador for\nFor one last I look ah we don't have any a Cuban cigars stores and in downtown Worcester and we're not making parts for fifty seven chevies which is what everybody in Cuba's driving right now\nOn you know even throughout the whole debate you know sitting next to him it was everything you see on TV you know it was every sound bite every talking point um that you hear over and over and over again but what I didn't hear was anything local\nYou know he didn't talk about the job the he didn't talk about the companies that have left western high tax\nRates and what can we do to incentivize more business development yeah luckily some of the businesses that have left western state in the district at a couple of them anyway which is good for the district but when it comes to a rising poverty rate here in the city\nThat does nothing to help and and I know that congressman doesn't have direct\nControl over that but indirectly he can really try to help and influence that environment here in West or\nWe're talking with Tracy live on she's running against congressman Jim McGovern and I'm going to step out of my opinion person role and just go to a role as an objective observer in terms of politics which I can do\nI watched a of the debate and um you've never debated before you can never the part of a ... he's been in office for what Twenty years he's been involved in politics all of his life\nSomebody who's never debated before I Believe actually defeated him in the debate if you if you scored ... points like watching a boxing match not who you agree with but scored on points she lost on points and yet is weak is he is\nTracy he's got a stranglehold on this area and you know that the district extends to North Hampton in Amherst how do you overcome that\nYou know what I'm really hoping you know\nEverybody listening to your show typically I think gets it we understand we're on the same page\nWe're not enough to do this I Need to ask everybody listening to your show to help\nReach out and we need our Democrat friends to help us win this election and I'm Talking true JFK conservative Democrats yeah love our country that\nAre not socialists Renee see you know a lot of our elderly folks you know going home talking to our moms and dads and our grandparents they fought a war\nAgainst fascism they've had a war against socialism they see what's happening and if they don't see it\nThey will be able to see it if we have the conversations um that's what I Need help with right now\nYou're making beer making a point about the Democrat Party that I made and where Jim McGovern\nJust refuses to accept that hey the Teamsters went with Trump now I'm a governor has got a good base of support among unions and I know for a fact\nThat the guys out in front of the debate the other night holding signs come on bought and paid for [noise]\nUnion people where he's still as strength I don't understand though while they're why they're still hanging in with him when the majority of unions rather than say the sci use but the regular unions\nAre going with Trump and the Republicans 'cause they say hey they're going to get us work\nWell and that's just it you know what it they'll get us work and when there's more work and more jobs available\nThe worker actually has so much more power yeah you know you don't have power as a worker if there's no jobs and you're a dime a dozen\nWhen there's more jobs than we have workers that's been in power as a worker that's what gives union power is when they're still needed yeah and I think the guys I when I talk to real workers there\nYou know when they go into the voting booth that's their decision to make right and I think they are being empowered you know we just had the Supreme Court um support of hey you know what\nYou don't have to pay your union right you know it used to be we want it to support our unions are are union supported us a but right now that there is questions why who is the union actually supporting the government or the worker\nTracy you got a background in business you under ...\nStay in business and I believe you're from graft and you had a um a health care company you're an entrepreneur Jim McGovern is never signed the front\nOf a check he's only signed the back does it bother you sometimes when you come up against\nA guy like that and you say how does he stay in power for so long why why why aren't these Democrats around here are getting it like Democrats in other parts of the country\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know I think a lot of them actually are sometimes you know I'll walk into a room and um I get the whispers and they're positive west or you know it's like\nYour job you know your human great we got your back but but they're whispers that quiet I've had people want to tell me they wanted a yard sign yeah but they're like but you know what I I Can't really take one right now\nAre there is a fear there is a fear out there of our politicians and to me that that's no different than like you were mentioning earlier kind of a third world country it's like\nHow can you be afraid to vote against all edition here in the United states\nWell in this area and I've coined the phrase I don't know if you've heard of the McGovern crime family but it's it's an old fashioned machine political machine in the region and um when you

Anthony Fox News the topic the presumed that murder of a journalist that the Saudi consulate Denise ... boxes Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nThe reasons for that obviously terrorists are going to play a role into that you have a tight labor market where look you can only grow GDP by pulling two lovers when it's all said and done\nHours worked and how productive you are during those hours if everyone's employing everyone's employed full time who wants to be\nHow many more hours are you going to be able to work there's only so many more people that you can actually get into the labor force so that means you've got to pull the productivity lover but we haven't seen productivity gains of any meaningful number in in the last\nDecade that but what about robotics what about like you look at robotics if all of a sudden you've got robotic cars and robotic warehouses we get to have that next year well your ear the cars are coming this year right aren't aren't\nThey any meaningful number we got two hundred Ninety million ... we have two hundred and Ninety million ... of human driven cars on the road today and how many self driving ones are we going to have ten thousand twenty you know it's like so that there simply aren't the productivity gains to be had\nSo what is it the the ... the neutral rate they like this is the part I don't understand I read the fed minutes and ... says and this is a quote from Jay Powell yep we're a long way from neutral at this point\nProbably I mean ... ... talk that that leads me to believe they don't really know what we're neutral third meeting they don't know we're neutral\nAs the other thing that you have to remember what the fed as much as they are a policy institution saying hey here's what we're going to do and here's what we're going to execute in the last decade really the last two decades they've become a messaging institution\nIt doesn't give you confidence so when you hear the chairman of the fed saying\nYou know we uh we we kind of think we're a long way from neutral but we don't really know for sure I mean ... what what is it like we ... investors want to know I thought they are rates go to four percent are they going to three percent are they going to two and a half when ...\nAnd I look at what Jay Powell is doing here and again you have to have this from a messaging perspective what is he trying to signal that he's trying to signal that we are not going to let inflation get out of control because once it does get out of control it's really hard to put that genie back in the bottle\nIt's a lot easier for him to be hawkish and go to dovish ... than the other way around thinking about it if you start off dovish right and then you say hey by the way we got to hike rates really quickly ... what happens to the housing market what happens to the stock market okay it's a lot easier to be hawkish and go to dovish\nThan the other way so from my perspective I think he's saying look\nWe're going to be as aggressive as we need to be in order to tamp down on inflation but I think if you get into next year I I I think that you end up in a situation where the economy is not strong enough\nFor it to warrant higher rate I think the feds between two really difficult their options here\nSo you're looking at two more hikes that's it you're looking at one in December\nMe personally I'm looking at two more hikes and then I think the fed let's inflation run hot because they're ... I don't think you can get to the point\nWhere this economy can sustain four percent interest rate so hike in December and then one sometime in the first half of next year first Africa and I think that's it that's it right because I I think they realize they have to let inflation run hot they just don't want a message it\nWell the you you may be right I you know many of you are\nBuying a lottery tickets in anticipation of winning the mega millions a we have an office pools going I Wonder how many people have been ... I think everybody's in it we get everyone in yeah so what do we got like twenty people it's like we are a couple of hundred bucks in there I think ... winter odds ...\nYeah they're good [laughter] good [laughter] I'm going to a Tucker [laughter] well let's look at\nThe uh the the the answers to questions that you might have if you were to win the mega millions a ... ... if you when it's a nine hundred million right [noise]\nThat's what it is currently it might go up by tomorrow based on how many people were buying tickets originally tomorrow is going to be eight hundred and thirty six million\nBut nine hundred million is the annuity amount sets like thirty million a year for Thirty years or something like a ... exactly and if I Want to lump\nSum so the lump sum is to get smaller okay if you take a look at the cash option right now it's five hundred and Thirteen million five ... I'll take the lump sum [noise]\nNow do you do that going on so I don't care what an all male couple of things to keep in mind okay the first is even with that you're not going to get that entire five hundred and Thirteen million dollars because they require you to withhold a big chunk up front so that Uncle Sam doesn't end up getting caught behind the eight ball when you spend it all on a yacht that only four percent right off the top\nSo they're going to take that right off the top okay which isn't enough because the tax rates thirty five okay it's going to end up being significantly higher\nBut the other thing you want to keep in mind Tucker so you get five hundred million dollars after taxes you can end up with call it's somewhere around three fifty okay oh shucks ...\nNot okay keep in mind you can't keep your name secret\nMatters had red heart I don't like okay so everyone who's ever met you okay Jimmy engraved including you either way if I'd have to change my name's including buried but you you'd have to change you'd have to go into witness protection alright ...\nThere's only six states where you can keep her name secret Delaware Kansas Maryland North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina I'm so there's not a whole lot of anonymity at this point\nIt's let me ask you a question Chuck in all seriousness let's say you when the nine hundred million\nAnd I know everybody takes the lump sum but that means you're subjecting that lump sum to a five percent tax in the state in which you live right assuming you live in Massachusetts that if you live in New Hampshire but if you're Connecticut resident Massachusetts resident\nYou're paying five and moved to new ... New Hampshire before tomorrow way cats that's the whole problem you've you've won that ticket so ... Morrow I'll be ... yeah well I'm going to do that just pick up and go right across the board if you take the annuity option though you could move to Florida or New Hampshire\nAnd then have those taxed at a lower rate in those states overtime yet normally I Would tell I was talking to Jim pleaded this morning as you were talking about whether we're going to take the lump sum or not and should always take the lump sum please tell ya you know you're really forty percent right off the top Tucker so you know that number you gave five hundred and Thirteen movies really like ...\nI'm not sure you get paid a year if you didn't take the lump sum it was thirty Thirty years or thirty million bucks a year which in the end you'd end up with how much uh you'd end up with somewhere around twenty million a year but you don't have like they want to let the okay so five hundred you get twenty million a year when you get it out so down he wouldn't\nHave to pay the state income tax because then you could move to a non tax state okay that that was the mayor went to the early on them you know if you want to move um how long do you have to clean the jackpot so let's assume Lee when and how much time do we have before we have to claim it\nDepends on the specific state but it's anywhere from a hundred and eighty days two years to the big thing that they always tell people look if if you do win the lottery isn't it if if for whatever reason you end up winning this thing which odds are you're not going to\nCan ... the country was younger though in two thousand eight than it is today [noise] you know you we probably age this country\nBy a year or two but we've always been aging through every session like no but we've always been getting older I ...

L. D. those or electronic and it measures whether the motors running or not and you can't fudge that\nNo one in pretty much these logging devices were mandated as of December ... twenty Seventeen so what I'm curious to see\nIn the years before if you take a look at the ... and really the reason that they're they're doing this is to try to make driving safe right now I'm just not just for the truckers but you know if a truck hits or your car your cars that take the ball on to the day when you're that you're you're done okay and so in twenty sixteen as an example\nForty four hundred and forty large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes what I'm curious about is whether there's a statistically significant difference now that this law is in place here if we see we don't know for five years no it'll probably take two or three years to be able to tell but look\nI'll tell you what if that number goes from forty four hundred down to Fifteen hundred ... pretty clear ... even though you might not have all the conclusive data you need it might be a really strong sign that things are moving there if you go from forty four hundred and forty two hundred\nYeah you're probably gonna need four or five years of data in order to figure out if there's something statistically significant that's actually going on here\nThe whole theory behind the law was that the truckers retired and they were having accidents because they're driving too much and they were exhausted yep right that that that's the whole genesis are ultimately it should increase wages\nRight 'cause you're you're you've got your fewer truckers that are available to work even fewer hours one would think that these guys and gals would start making more money it is still not that there's not be although they are they are ... well\nI was there was the highest rate of pay increases that of any industrial\nI understand but it's still not where should be you don't know about half of what it was in the seventh so it\nIt it still is well below where it should be the downside to hire truck your pay is that with how much we buy online today is going to drastically affect shipping costs and that's part of the reason why you're seeing the post office looking for ten percent hikes now just about everything that they're trying to mail these\nDays on Amazon and raise their prices by what twenty percent to be a prime member\nYup they went up ... it's all going to filter through no paper which again these are people who should have been paid more to begin with I don't have a problem with it but that's what the reality is known to be folks in terms of uh where are we going on this\nCould have that you had your life I had I had it out of order I didn't know what I Know I had it out of order here so I guess we'll do it now and folks\nOver twenty percent of Americans have save nothing for their retirement can you imagine that if you're sixty five and you haven't saved a nickel\nHopefully none of you

brief actionable ideas for thoughtful investors Adam good to have you on today\nOh thanks for having me as always\nAdam I Want to talk a little bit on raids cheering and specifically we got a you know some submitted notes from the fed yesterday and it it seems like there's a very hawkish tone there my personal view\nIs I don't actually think the fed is his hawkish as they are presenting I think it's just easier to go from hawkish to dovish down the road than the opposite what's your take on the situation\nYeah I think you're right and I think it's also important to look at what they're actually saying and kind of funny though these guys out there who read the statement it and create all kinds of the charts based on the word\nYou know appear and the word strong or some variation of drawing like strongly are stronger strongest whatever anyway\nUh some variation on that word strong has appeared like thirty times in all of the minutes since April as opposed to a year ago when you saw you know some version of strong lonely like you know three or four so clearly the fed is saying you know things are getting better their quote unquote getting stronger but um you know\nIt it's at this point with GDP at ... percent inflation still only you know in the two you know to point to two or three percent I'm actually a really good combination so it you know strong is not something to be worried about right\nIn terms of oil or oils been focused this week with\nUh the murder of the Washington Post journalist ah who we we're not sure exactly what happens but it happened but it doesn't ... really good there's been a lot of talk as to whether or not the U.S is going to take a a retaliatory response in response to Saudi Arabia here\nBut the oil market not really suggesting that that's going to happen with west Texas intermediate below Seventy dollars a barrel after being above Seventy five last week\nIt merely suggesting especially when you hear the rhetoric coming out of the sea he doesn't sound like there's going to be much of a response here\nAgreed and by the way thank you for mentioning that you know because it's so we look at the headlines and jump on Twitter and and you know\nYou just get carried away with emotional thing whatever happened there we don't really know what ever happened is crazy but what mattered more than anything else is the relationship between\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S you know Israel and Saudi Arabia are the strongest allies the U.S has that region and let me tell you we need them in spite of the craziness whatever the Saudis which\nClearly is pretty shocking world the fact that oil is under a book called the marketing of dried there's going to be a breakdown in the relationship because if they're work it'd be a lot higher than that the fact is on Saudi Arabia the U.S and Russia\nAre all prompting more than ... million barrels a day we have never seen that before though there is a lot of oil out there and I'm Glad to see the reality is that by the band was governing oil right now ... behind the crazy situation however went down\nAnd um I have a question for your relating to a growth\nTwenty Nineteen ... you'd chatted a little bit about you know word for point two percent of GDP right now I'm curious where do you think things are going in Nineteen just 'cause\nI Will get the message out there and it does have me concerned about a slowing specifically look with regards the long term GDP Growth there's two lovers you can pull\nHow many hours do people work in the aggregate what kind of productivity that they have I don't see movement happening rapidly enough next year to get us back to three percent I'm curious what your thoughts are on it\nIt's going to be hard to squeeze more productivity out of people I mean you already have unemployment at what point seven percent of the year low yeah people are working hard you know our early\nA number of hours that our work per week now that's trapped by the deal is you know that that's pretty strong it's hard to take it too much higher than we are now so I I hear you\nOn the point about productivity um the good news is well there are a couple of pieces and you know me I'm an optimist but um\nThere is technology now that he's touching absolutely every single bit I mean every target has become one of the target the store has become one of the biggest abusers of artificial intelligence a I\nMean they record how Americans are dressed in position around the store on Monday versus to this day and that impacts sales et cetera so it's technology that's able to you know keep driving these additional games you know I mean think about what's happening in your Instagram\nFeed now where you know if you were on the Patagonia website you saw those baggy shorts you know where to cool down that um last Saturday well all of a sudden out there that there's this one click buy this now\nAdd that appears in your Instagram feed and all of a sudden your tap water right so there were these there's these things that are happening because the technology that I think are are enabling businesses to be more productive consumers to be more active\nAnd as long as people are employed and they're spending money that's going to try it again so um yes but here you completely on squeezing the productivity thing but I think technology is actually pushing the goalpost farther down the field\nAre good at and we've got to run but thanks for joining us and we will catch up with the next week that his Adam Johnston from New York joining us from ... new bull's eye picks on Sunday Morning and you can sign up at ... dot com the boys are talking about oil it's pretty sixty nine Seventeen per barrel\nThat's good news folks Dow is down thirty six points the S. and P. as off five in the NASDAQ is down forty two points we'll be back with more on the financial district [laughter]\nWith only a husky ... ... and ...\nBenjamin Franklin captured lightning in a

T. A. G. H. D. Worcester and I argue radio station\nTrump has been briefed by a secretary of state I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nStuff there are lots of stories out there about what has happened my bumper\nHeart is buying a cancer drug maker called Indo site for two point one billion dollars in cash why would they do that\nYes they're ah they're buying this company a for again that to point one billion dollar\nA price tag here and you know pretty much Novartis if if you take a look at you know what they're trying to do here\nUm it's ... they're trying to buy effectively drug pipeline specifically related to oncology that's way under state really specializes in I have no idea at all of this is a good price or fair price for the company but the big things Novartis even growing much organically at this point for their sales growth was you know three percent for the quarter\nOr they're you know earnings growth was two percent for the quarter so they're relatively stable company right now and I think to be completely honest or going out there saying hey we want to try to buy growth for the future\nThat's what a lot of them do the right they they they they buy these little small ...\nIs the right now it's it's one of the main ways but a lot of these companies build their pipelines and grow at this point I'm just because it it gives them away so they don't have to do the early stage investing they can say OK here's where the risk is right\nWe're going early stage there's risk even if some of these I mean we've seen cases where you know drugs get you know company a buyer you know another company that's in stage to her stage three of you know if the approval\nAnd the thing flops on its face and they got to write the whole thing off I mean there there still is that potential out there there's definitely less risk if you're going in\nTo this to the stage of company but there still is a lot out there just because again you you never quite know what's going to actually end up paying off I mean think about all the old timers trials that have been out there for in the last couple of years where you've had ... Merck said look we're just we're giving up 'cause we can't do any like\nYeah they they're so much at all timers is one where they there's been a lot of false starts isn't there\n... if it's like fusion power we are always ten years away from a cure that's it's just you're always ten years away it feels like\nHey a Tesla advancing in China buying land for a factory that they think they'll actually own\nYes they bought a two hundred and ten acres site in ah just outside Shanghai costs them about a hundred and forty million dollars to buy this um which I Will get this is my first question to be honest was okay so they bought the land for a hundred and forty million to give your factory they built in Nevada cost them was three billion dollars I think\nWhere are they going to get the money to build this thing now you know I Wonder if you know wonder how much the if the Chinese government's investing well and and this is where I was going so you on mosque is obviously not a fan of the SEC the short seller enrichment commission as he called them a couple of weeks ago which probably didn't do any favors\nI Wonder if he ends up getting kind of pushed into China's orbit on this and do we really want to lose a guy like that [noise]\nWell it depends what depends what you mean by a guy like that\nIt's pretty bright guy and then ... it'd be like ... you know you think about all the innovation that he's brought whether you're talking about pay Powell a space sacks he space excellent yep I'm you know tests or whether you like the guy or not it's pretty smart guy either you really want to chase them into the arms of the Chinese\nAre really smart guy there's no doubt about it but I Would make the case you kind of chased them self their ... you know it's not like based on behavior it's always on doing that you know so I I just wonder if you start sending up working closer to that orbit but to be honest I don't know if you'd really get along well and China I don't\nKnow that you know like I like I said he's going to be five hundred thousand cars a year there\nI don't know if he doesn't like the oversight from the SEC yeah you think he's going to like Chinese oversight right in Chinese oversight is come over here we're going to put a bullet in your head so it's it's it's something I I just don't know if he is necessarily a good fit over it but he might find themselves kind of pushed into that orbit\nNow though is uh we we will watch that story or with continued interest\nA question comes up what happens if you convert a rental property indoor personal resident hook you say you bought a property in Florida and you you live in New England you bought a property in Florida\nYou bought it five years ago he bought a ten years ago and you rented it out so you've been renting it out collecting the income on it and now you're retiring Chuck and you want to move into that ... property in Florida\nGet a CPA yeah get edited yet so in the way that it typically works remember you can declare a property as a primary residence if you've lived there for two out of five years and being able to do that\nAllows you to offset up to five hundred thousand dollars and capital gains if you're married two hundred and fifty thousand if you are single that's the exemption you get if you're able to satisfy that requirement\nIt's a little different when you have a rental property in that if you've been depreciating rental property there's going to be some recapture of that depreciation that you've taken and that that's\nWhat I wanted to point out on this story when you do that you can do it you can convert a rental property into a personal residents you can get the five hundred thousand dollar tax free game\nBut you can never escape that depreciation recapture you're always going to pay the taxes on that so if you owned it for ten years and you wrote off two hundred thousand dollars in depreciation yeah\nEven if you're within that five hundred thousand kept gain tax free cap game you're still going to pay the tax on that two hundred thousand of depreciation that you\nKnow it's really important to make sure that you have any attacks advisors will get that that just because otherwise it's going to be a situation where I've seen cases where people don't realize that the case and all of a sudden the IRS is you know send them a letter and they're going gee I thought I got this exemption you got the exemption on the sales price but you have to factor in that depreciation recapture\nComing up we're going to be joined by

anything on the platform that's where they got into trouble they pretty much made accounts on the platform message big seller saying hey why don't you bring your business Amazon and had violated the terms of service of the platform\nSo how do you think this gets results because this is going to be expensive you think it will be oh don't you ... that seems like a big violation and Amazon's already

the damage is like I don't think anybody's going to jail but how much is like what they're like you know how much was how what good's actually changed like\nThat's the way through that there's nothing

Amazon to stop to think that's the big thing is they they're just like look stopped taking or sellers that's the big thing that they want\n'em but I I don't think you're going to get a big settlement
