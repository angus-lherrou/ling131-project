{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "A feeling for a very very long time and for someone in your position to actually said out loud and don't you dare apologize for that\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeated it consistently gets repeated and it was fabulous and again it was\nYou know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nWell thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in a Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's Sunday you\nKnow we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really upset me free tickets but seriously oh now all of a sudden you're interested later it can change I I ... you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks ... we'll see you or what is the Sunday\nUh ... I think it's Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be ... there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the nation's turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nAs it does and up Pittsburgh we've got something special for you we're going to have laughs and and comedy but uh\nAlso uh I Am a taking all of the proceeds from\nThe I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're uh we're we're\nStanding with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets\nOr will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish\nUm center perhaps the synagogue launcher an odd sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember [laughter] and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example of that supporting the Jewish\nPeople and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros\nOr as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond because I\nFound an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard\nA that was a national award one of the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was\nJust presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nWell that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed it's not a big one so it's just\nAmazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporter it's all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros that you are an anti Semite it's completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd I ... the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal has progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him more rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he is a very shady history or around the world that but\nAnti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew at the same way they don't\nLike fish Shapiro because in front of a hero because importing policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism I I'm not a fan no not a fan\nOf fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like within Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and\nThey don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know his hand on the night it's not all understand that they're just trying to\nUse this to make it look like conservatives they're anti Semite we you're telling me the way they uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who was one of the biggest find that the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nOr it doesn't not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe it's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... ... is such a a ...\nA Ken this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway because they don't care\nThat is that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear a solution there too [noise]\nYeah go to a battering I don't know I got out of ... and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise]

basketball and football\nNow it's not if you don't need it in baseball because one player can't transformed the sport that can transform a team the way they can and in basketball as an example\nHockey is a team sport and balls and ultimate team sport you know you have a great quarterback but a terrible defense you not winning and things\nI disagree in football football you have a great quarterback it can hide a lot of things will get a look at the patriots last year yeah there was a God awful\nOr just look across the board the NFL and we have all the poor quarterbacking right now yeah yeah it ... basically I still think a salary cap is an influence in the age of ... the issue in terms of our games yeah in terms of interest now matter of fact her whatsoever interesting uh IBM\nI got news of this last night it was sitting on actually with my son were having dinner and I asked him I said you see that IBM bought red hat and he was shocked when I told them how much they were paying for the company hundred and Ninety dollars a share\nYeah this this is effectively and in mission by IBM in a very expensive admission\nThat what they've tried to do over the last decade hasn't worked that's ... that's the message that I take from this because red hat was a company that was valued and it was somewhere around Eighteen billion dollars that was training about six times sales and they paid eleven times sales\nFor this company and read have pretty much what they do their their cloud computing company that focuses on the Olympics development\nAnd this is pretty much the admission from I've yeah it's a new company it's not like it's what twenty five years old something like that it's not like yeah it was it I mean twenty five is you know I guess it means acknowledging that you're not a new company but you know this is a company that\nYou know in IBM that pretty much in doing this is admitting nothing that we're doing on the cloud side is working and so we just need to spend a boatload of money and hope that this works out my\nMy impression of the deal and I'm not a technology guy but it's like a Hail Mary on the part of Geneva comedy you know she's a failed CEO right she's been there six years stock has been just miserable just pretty much the mission that she did fail and uh she survive\nThey give imagine if this 'cause the the impression I have is they pay too much I again I could be wrong but if if this goes south and if this doesn't have a major impact like how long does she have to make this deal work a year two years three years\nSo IBM as as a result of making this deal has said they've suspended their share buybacks for the next two years in order to clean things up from a cash flow perspective that they need the money for this is a big cash deal so we're doing I I look at this and in theory you've got to give her at least to the end of that just because you know that's where you're going to potentially see ... what happens there but\nI mean you look at all of the deals of this side that have happened this size that have happened in tech they generally don't\nWork out what um when when you look at this deal that thirty four billion dollar price tag 'em do way if you're a shareholder in red hat\nAnd you say why don't want to take a hundred and Ninety dollars you don't really have any choice do\nWhere would you not want to take the one nine to ... you know just to say you think it's worth\nI don't know two ten or something you want to ... all you can really do is vote against you have to take the cash maybe there's acts reason you don't want to do it yeah you have no chance your your your your that cat that deal that money's going to show up in your brokerage account whether you want to know how long does it take a deal like this because it's like when\nYou let's say I owned a thousand shares a red hat right\nAnd it's going to close is it\nIs it the year end is it to one is a cute to some of these deals take a long time and it and some of them get need government approval\nFor what they're guiding chew on this is that is going to take somewhere between six and nine months for this deal to actually close so it's not a tax issue for this you know it it's likely going to end up being somewhere I Would guess in the second quarter early third quarter next year is where is the this close to late spring early summer is is kind of what you're seeing\nA for when this closes but\nI'll tell you if if I'd be him get this one wrong ...\nThey're not out of business because companies that big don't go out of business but they're going to be in a case where they're digging out for the next decade\nYeah you know what I said to my son I said this sounds like a G E type deal this is something Jeff ... would have done I was going to the age of ... okay yeah that may be a better you met maybe a better comparison\nOf the attack a relationship but we'll see you know it's easy to a to point fingers and cast aspersions we're not in the boardroom we don't have access to the financials we're just looking at I just said holy smokes you're paying a hundred and Ninety bucks for a company that on friday closed at one eleventh\nThis this is one of those deals and and here's the other thing is you look at this and you look at kind of when they're doing this it really rings similarly to the AOL Time Warner merger you know peek value weight like it just eat has all the feeling of like something that just isn't going to work\nAnd you kinda wonder does red hat end up on top with this deal does this become a red hat culture company because redhead\nYou will get its redhead success in revenue growth and share price appreciation I mean they're they're one heck of a company\nThey're still here's the thing so red how they do about that last year about two point nine billion dollars in revenue IBM did you know Ninety five billion so IBM is still you know far and away the biggest piece why understand but you look at growth well here's the thing though is in order to justify this multiple\nThey don't have to grow just you know what they've been they've got to grow through the roof and I just\nIt's a really tough pot the spin\nOn the half of a IBM is that this will access them to new growth categories and there'll be able to you know really improve their sales I you know I I got to tell you I think Jenny is too old to be running this company oh I disagree with that tech companies I think tech companies and the young CEOs\nI disagree with that now you know I mean look at Tim Cook Tim Cook is you know not a spring chicken these I think going to be fifty eight fifty nine\nYou know in the next you know you got a good example you know so like I don't think you have to be in your thirties and forties yes you know well they know that if any of our yeah but still he was older when he was no no he wasn't he he was a kid he started that when he was at Harvard but more I\nLook at you know some of the some of the again you know I don't know if you need to be in your thirties and forties but you just need to be good and Janine ... just not appeared to be able to turn the corner for the last five years

doesn't pay well it's only like an eleven dollars an hour\nJob no it it it it doesn't pay well and I think\nYou know what's what's really interesting to me is the kind of look at where we've come from in kind of this in in dealing with the the problem of aging mhm 'cause it's just kind of a new issue it on two fronts number one you have people living longer okay so that means that they you know a greater percentage of people are going to run into something that doesn't kill them but requires them to have care\nYou know used to be if you go back to you know the forties fifties and sixties\nYou didn't have a ton of people that needed this level of care\n'cause most of the time what ever happened to them usually they were dying anyways you know they didn't have this level or the disability and they didn't live for ten years in that state no it's it's the medical advances have gotten to the point where we can keep people alive now but we don't really have a system or a way to take care of them easily\nAnd the problem I think is compounded by the fact that in today's world in so many families both spouses have to work in order to make ends meet and so you end up in a situation where a family member can't be that person carrying it a lot of\nCase what about assisted living facilities because that's a that's an alternative they you know I'm going through this with family members now where you know they're they're selling their house right and they're buying a unit in assisted living now that cost depending on where you are\nBut that's about four or five hundred thousand dollars but if you have equity in your home if you own your home outright you can afford that\nBut then you're looking at the the cost for this couple is six thousand three hundred dollars a month I really question how many retirees can afford six thousand three hundred dollars a month every month you not not that many it made me no families don't have that much in gross income\nNo and and it's in in particular what you're going to see is you know so many people in ... really it's it's generation X and kind of the beginning part of the millennial generation are going to be in situations where they're having to care for parents now but also still having kids and their teams and a lot of\nCases so what are you guys gonna do are you going to like have your folks moved in with you are you going to pay the assisted living facility yourself ... like I I mean right now I'm not joking about this this is a serious issue that millennials are going to have to take care of no way the boomers we're going to be you know we're we're going to be the ones that need taking care of\nNo idea I I I have no idea how to deal\nWith it really no easy solution is there no it's if you wear how ... what do you do put them in a warehouse\nYou've got two options you have care for them yourself you know or spend money so someone else care so the ... like either way like there's no easy way to deal with\nIt because the nursing homes are closing ... we've seen a wave of nursing home closures because they're saying hey the government regulations and this is you know this is a it's a fascinating topic and I'm not an expert on it but you look\nAt the reason nursing homes are closing we you close your business because you're not making any money right right and and the government says well you must have this many nurses you must have this many doctors you must have this type of\nCare well the government regulation is driving up the cost\nAnd I understand the logic behind it right it it's kind of like daycare you get a lot of government regulation involved in daycare because a kid dies well same thing in a nursing home a senior citizen dies and the government feels the need to say well you must have this type of care available you must adhere to these regulations and then eventually these nursing home say\nThey they have the white flag they just say look we're done I talked to ... we have a client who who are used to run a health care facility and he said very you know you you have no idea what kind of merging compression we've experienced in the last Twenty years\nOn in in in looking at this overall don't get me wrong ... these are good problems to have because the the flip side of this is look if people just you know pass away then like you don't have to deal with this problem but no one wants that you don't want your loved ones that just passed away it's OK we need to figure out how to care for him so it's\nIt's a good problem but there's no easy answers because of how we've built\nA boat the system right now that cares for people as they age and the fact that many families they can't take enough time off to care for these ... to care for a folks who need it you know in their families it's we're we're just not built in today's society to deal with these problems in that risk is going to be present whether or not we build\nSystems to fix this or not [noise] an interesting topic that would require much more time and research we can solve this in ten minutes no no\nNo I didn't think so hey when we come back we're going to tell you how

Seventeen think about it ... it couldn't have been more than five years ago when they just took started so in ...\nPast us it looks like it was twenty eleventh about seven years ago actually is when they passed us but here if you want to see a fascinating one two thousand eight they sold six point seven million vehicles in China mhm two years later it was Thirteen point seven they doubled sales in two years\nWondered though how viable that is long term ... based on the density their population you know automobile travel I think we're learning that in the United states is in our major cities are clogged because of cars\nLong term if if the solution out of this is a combination of city design a building cities that are going to get around by foot\nA mass transit and and you know alternative means of you know personal transportation like bikes and scooters and stuff that's\nThat's how you get rid of traffic otherwise about car pooling that doesn't do enough now does it's\nIt's just too when you talk about traffic the thing that's fascinating about it is it's really it's it's a geometry project ... if you are an individual the driving in a car okay average us cars about Eighteen feet long it's about six feet wide so if you look at it it's about you know a hundred and ten square feet is how much space you take up when you're in a car and a hundred and ten\nEven if you ... you get for people in there you're still like twenty seven twenty eight square feet per person\nWhich is why when you talk about bikes and scooters and walking you're down to you know you could go you know four feet in either direction for a dollar Fifteen or sixteen square feet buses the best we're down to look pretty much you know eight to nine square feet per person and that's where you want to get too so it's it's really a geometry problem in cars are just\nNot sufficient you need to be careful about Medicare part B why if you miss the age cut off which is sixty five by the way folks\nYou get penalized in a big way for having missed out on that Medicare a premium the way it works is\nIf you have basically six months before he turned sixty five you have to enroll in Medicare part B if you miss it and some people do you've got hundreds of thousands of Americans who have missed the cut off and are paying a penalty as a consequence\nYeah and it it it's something that again if you are you know kind of getting towards that point uh you need to make sure that your your cognizant of this simply because right now\nUm if you're signing up for part B cost a hundred and thirty four month right now it's going up to one thirty five fifty [laughter] um and so you know you do need to make sure that you're signing up if you end up with that penalty okay for each year that you'd delay Medicare as a permanent ten percent penalty to your premium so few Mitt\nTried to imagine why somebody wouldn't sign up at sixty five\nI think in a lot of cases it might be ignorance okay just ...
