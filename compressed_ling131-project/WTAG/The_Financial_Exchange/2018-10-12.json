[laughter] yeah [laughter] right if someone's offered to give you you know helping assistance with your dreams and goals you know you better take the ... of course you also several um about two or three years passed by and my brother um Daryl and I wanted to\nI wanted to go back to school and I picked up a U.S News World report and said I Want to go to the number one school and education\nAt the time it was hard for graduate school of education yep so I'm brother and I applied in just before we um\nCincinnati application I gave a George Stephanopoulos was the chief of staff at the time you have a call and I said hey it's a lot further Dale guy is a song that you did yeah I did\nAnd he goes ah I said my brother and I applied to Harvard anything the president do be greatly appreciate you know what do I lose you know I already became a first generation college student in northeast\nRight you add attained or that the goal yeah\nA phenomenal experience and then I'm like you know I Want to go to Harvard why not me why not\nYou know someone who grew up the way I grew up but I grew up in a great community you know panic it's a great community that is we just uh you know my mom was like you know housekeeper of the neighborhood you know but ah but everyone treated her you know I mean who had some mixed but ah yeah but most folks you know helped out a lot\nAnd so um I don't know all of what he did but I Do know that we did receive letters of recommendation some support from the late great Senator Kennedy and a Senator Kerry yep\nAnd um I Know that the call was made to Lawrence Summers who was the president of Harvard says you might want to take a second look at these applications yeah you know these kids these boys from a strip overcome a lot\nAnd they're really on the rise on the rise as watching me right or watch me ride and um and so he uh so with the with all that you know a brother Darrell and I got an Harvard\nAnd we um spent a year\nIn Cambridge was an amazing experience who he graduated a and a from there I live I moved out to California yeah than the last time of your PHD Twenty years and then and then received my PHD from the University of San Diego and leadership studies\nSo let's go back and by the way folks we're talking with Dr love otherwise known as Doug loves thorough he's an author\nInspirational speaker and you just heard the incredible journey now the ... the most difficult question is I Know you I Know you said it was my mom\nWho instilled in me that\nI Will I wanted to be the first in my family to go to college here in in a situation where there is a domestic situation you're you're homeless\nYour are you are the child of a single mother you're playing the role of a father as a kid ... three younger siblings okay so everybody's got that we're all looking at that and we all know how sometimes that ends up the question is for you didn't Dr loss\nIt didn't end up that way now I Know you say your mother and everything else but there's a lot of people out there\nWith great single moms who are doing everything they can for the kids and they don't go the way of Dr loss right\nWhat was that now that Dr ... had\nYou know I'm I'm a man of faith so faced definitely playing a role in it are definitely my mom as I mentioned I think I Would see the uh the last component was be my circle of influence my circle of connection I struggled with people that were\nPlaced in my life at just the right when\nYou mean around the time you're rich Doherty or do you mean around the time when you were younger yeah you\nKnow that's a great question you know really it started with a you know and I can I I you know there's it's so vivid the people come to mind Mike by baseball coach coach Miller just super cat little league yeah I mean\n... ... ah he was a phenomenal guy but he was a no nonsense guy so he was pretty controversial did the little league dates back into you know Jesse Burr kept but he was phenomenal you know ... ... one of those in so he ... and all these people tell me lessons the lesson he taught me was\nYou know a show up on time show before you're supposed to be there because I'm a little things happening so for instance if we the first day of practice um everyone should have been practice now I should have been practice a half an hour early and I was intimidated going into\nUh the baseball diamond for some reason you know like I just didn't fit in you know yeah and so I kind of stayed on the outside and wait until everyone else got there\nAnd then I then I showed up well I I ended up being late because of that and he goes love Pearl you you know if your ten minutes\nI Want you to remember this if you ten minutes earlier on time if you're on time you're late and if you come late you run a ... and you got to remember that for life when you show up for a job interview you show from work\nAnd you and your ten minutes late in the real world you get fired you know I was ten years old when he was well you know and he was that was tough for a kid to hear that yeah and then moving right up and like you got into ... the greatest teacher I had in the world are names ... she was my music teacher but she was more than a music teacher\nYou know she kind of like she look deep into my soul I knew she cared about me\nThat's why I kept going to school during tough times because I knew I didn't want to miss the just the little small Italian lady um you know\nI'm looking for me you know so I was like I Want to go to school and she really guided me she was almost like a second mother so these people were instrumental then I had as many Pam\nBut I suppose that that may or that that may end up in that case it each person in each kid is uh is is different for sure but uh you know you need to let them know that you're doing whatever you're doing because you love 'em and this year\nA as you're dead you're they're mainly not when times are good but mainly when things are bad I may be the only friend that you are\nYeah there you have but make no mistake about it I'm On your side now you may disagree with what I'm about to do\nBut uh you know I have put one through a treatment and uh and and I bought it with a with a ... mainly over this idea of a of God and and that may be the only thing that'll save your behind and they are and the final analysis\nBut you try talking to a like a Fifteen year old about a drug and alcohol and\nAnd the existence of God and uh you can get into some interesting discussion [noise]\nUm I Know that a ... year to talk about the

um\nAnd both a format and heart attack and it'll have then the whole story I was in the middle of writing the book the reason I wrote the book is because I Want my kids to know and I came to faith and ah and why\nAnd that it's not\nSomething that's imagine a kid would rather see a good Sherman than heroin any day of the week\nAnd so you know being totally honest with them and um\nAnd then I'm not the situation occurred was Fletcher and he had told me that he got it you know up to that point and I spoke to him two hours before I found him so I had no idea and I consider that a A R would be able to recognize signs if anybody could\nAnd I'm I'm a relive those events daily and uh\nAnd pretty much you know kick myself enough ... for doing it or not doing what I shouldn't have done enough of kind

older lifted paving the way for overtime to the U. S.\nBut I think that the fed can mitigate it in the short term just by saying hey we said this but here's what we actually met sure can we do a little bit of\nInterest rates went to one and why this matters because it's not\nIt's not so intuitive it's not like oh banks went out of business and so the stock market's crashing when interest rates go up specifically the ten year treasury that is what you consider to be your risk free rate and so here is how I you know tend to explain it to folks which is\nAs investors were making decisions every day\nWe're saying if you're investing in the stock market you're saying I Believe that the stock market is going and going to go up\nAnd it's going to go up more than the risk free rate that I can get on my money which these days with a ten year treasury it's about three point two percent so you're saying hey I think that's stocks over the long term are going to beat out my risk free rate on treasuries\nAs that number gets higher it's tougher to justify\nSo why do you the you know the thirty five year old who is still working and saying yeah I don't care about the short term long term I'm sure it'll lead beat out the risk ... says they all still invest in stocks well the Seventy five year old might be a little bit differently and they might be\nYeah you know this the stock market has been pretty good to me but I can now go get a CD at my bank paying two and a half percent and that's good enough\nAnd so you've got that going on in also interest rates also changed the pricing on other assets as well in that let's say that you are Tucker and you are in the market for a home right now and you've been looking at homes over the course that somebody said gee\nThe thirty year a mortgage rate right now I can get a mortgage at four and a half percent which means that can buy a home worst X number of dollars will if interest rates go up by half a percent effectively cuts you're buying power by five percent with the way the math works let's say that you were originally looking at properties in the two hundred thousand dollar range\nAnd all of a sudden rates go up by half a percent now you're kept out at a hundred and Ninety thousand it doesn't mean that your monthly payments going to be more at that one Ninety versus two hundred but it doesn't mean if you're selling a home\nThe pool of buyers that you have might not be able to afford the way you were originally priced your homes home prices and other asset prices start to fall as a result of that so the concern then\nIs one of the major ways that we grow our economy is through consumer spending largely financed by borrowing if we can't borrow as much we can't grow the economy as much as right that's pretty much what we're looking at their so\nSorry for being a little bit technical and breaking things down to almost a dumb down version folks but it helps sometimes to get some context around why things seemed to be falling apart and falling apart so quickly\nThe other minor impact that may have been a factor this week that hasn't been talked about a lot is we're right in that in between stage where the quarter has ended\nBut companies haven't yet reported earning yep so most of them don't do stock buybacks during that period of time and I don't know how big that impact is\nBut if all the companies that are out there that have been buying back their stock put a pause on that for a few weeks because they're potentially you know insider information problems\nThat can lead to a little bit of you know access ah down selling in that period of time does that\nWere you in the long term if that's the case you know short term impact so I look at it actually the opposite way it in it let's say that the market is being kept afloat largely by buybacks and I and I'm I'm not saying it is but let's say those hypothesized that the market was being kept afloat by buybacks okay\nBut when the economy turns down companies stopped buying back stock which means that you're going to see a steep herself so it's something that concerns me from that perspective and that you know everyone always point the buybacks and just have this ... great it's going to keep the company afloat\nBut what if the circumstances changed so that the company can't make the buyback anymore\nI agree with you I just don't think that that is what is actually you know floating up the stock market and is it I think it's just a small piece of things that might have added a little bit of extra volatility on the downside this week\nBut I just I always look at it people to buy back we'll put a floor on the stock and they go what if the ... you know like you're assuming that the buyback is going to still be there\nAre some news coming out of China yesterday a China posting a record trade surplus with the U.S in September largely before or the latest round of tariffs went in and really more than anything else I think the signals that a lot of companies were

[laughter] yeah exactly\nWhat you're gave her name that you play under a ... forty two no no one oh I'd say anyway that was Wall Street watch presented by leader bank and the rate for the holidays we'd have bank does have a wide selection of gold and silver billion coins but not video games available at all of their locations\nCoal leader bank at eight seven seven six nine one seven nine zero zero for more information so prior to that break\nWe were talking about the fact that postage rates going up on everything especially in particular the parcels select service the Amazon uses\nFor delivery so this does take us to our poll question of the day up right now at financial exchange show dot com should postage rates for Amazon Go up more than other customers so you can go over to financial exchange show dot com and vote on that\nIf you want to text us your opinion as well just because I like to hear the reasoning behind it sometimes text us at six three five six six and let us know why Amazon should or should not pay more or less than other customers\nSo again question isn't should Amazon Pay more because I think there's a lot of agreement that that the rates probably should go up for Amazon it's whether they should pay more than the other customers for the saying yes the product exactly got\nA by the way so this uh this hike on postage rates would take the first class stamp for fifty cents up to fifty five cents\nA just as a a an interesting little tidbit fuel back in Nineteen Ninety One which is the first year that I remember posted traits they were twenty nine cents then glad I bought thirty thousand dollars worth of a forever stamps back then exactly right you don't want the ... was introduced I don't think it was either oh three or ... or somewhere in that ballpark\nUm we do have some tax on the post office anyways uh from nine seven eight the post office still a good deal overseas people pay much more for first class whether that is one hundred percent accurate from Fort won three privatize the post office\nI'm I don't know that I just I don't know if that actually saves any money big problems the post office has had the last few years of trying to get ahead on there a pension payments rather than them losing money just on their service actual you could\nPrivatize the post office you just wouldn't have easy access to postage in rural areas anymore which is kind of the big problem right I mean that's that's kind of been the big issue and the big cost is you know some remote town in Alaska needs to have a post office and that's really expensive [noise]\nWhat do we talk a little bit about the ah the gas line explosions from a late last month that occurred in the Lawrence area causing all those explosions and fires the NTSB is that with their preliminary report and it does not particularly good for Columbia gas\nIt doesn't look particularly good for Columbia gas but honestly this report to me leave so many questions unanswered and effectively what the investigation found was that some work that was being done on a pipe\nFrom the early Nineteen hundreds or they were posted the contract and you're supposed to relocate in underground pressure censor from this demand pipe and that didn't happen the big question mark that\nIs out there is was this the ... the fault of\nThe contract and that was doing the work was at Columbia gas prop Columbia gases fall because they didn't explain how the project is supposed to be done and how did was there no checks and balances here to make sure that you know something this severe didn't get followed up on a we have a lot more questions to be answered here\nYeah so pretty much what you ended up with which is what I had originally you know kind of thought was you at high pressure lines that ended up connected to low pressure systems which eventually they do but you're supposed to have monitoring in place so that they don't over pressurized and that monitoring was not present in\nSo occasionally the justice system works as\nYou wanted to or in this world a lot of times it doesn't but occasionally it gets things exactly right do the two of you remember ah the ah the fire festival from last\nYear yes the uh if if you're not familiar with it burning man no uh the fire festival fire being spelled\nF. Y. R. E. this was the one that was supposed to be on a remote island in the Bahamas that was supposed to be a really exclusive festival and it costs like thousands of dollars to get there because you were supposed to have like a private cabana and they were the food was supposed to be professionally catered\nAnd it turned out that they had like ... houses and literally cheese sandwiches and they just did not plan to sing at all I remember the so it it it turned out that the guy running at this guy William McFarland\nPretty much made the entire thing up and had no idea how to put any of this on\n... and so he sold a effectively he'd defrauded investors of twenty six million dollars twenty ... twenty six million dollars and so this morning or he has put guilty and is sentenced to six years in jail as a result of a wire\nFraud and bank fraud that's a long time I only did was rip off a bunch of millionaires or so of the charge that actually got him in this case\nUm was she wrote a check using the name and account number of one of his employees without authorization that we do it will get you just about every time that I Would imagine he's not actually going to serve all six years I'd imagine is probably in for two to four\nUm but you know obviously this is one of those cases where it does appear the justice has been served here\nIn this case I mean what I mean it's twenty six years old but just the dummy move it it's not good and uh I don't know if people ended up getting any money back who actually tried to go [laughter] so under the radar yesterday\nA there was a fairly big bill that was signed by the president or with regards to music copyright\nUh in giving or just a little bit more protection or as we continue to make deeper inroads into the streaming age as that becomes the primary way that people access music what can you tell us about\nThis Mike so there are a number of just strange loopholes that are being closed here a there's a small Rand things where it seems that I'm for streams songs that were created before Nineteen Seventy two artist weren't receiving royalties those aged ... which is just bury you know just random and strange so that's been cleared up\nUh there's also it seems like it's also lowering the barriers to entry for somebody knew to get into the streaming game because it allows you immediate access to an entire library of songs or rather than having to go to studio studio\n... so it basically could say you know more competitors could jump into this a lot easier than the apples Pandora's box defies that are already out\nAnd I think the big thing here is\nIt eliminates some of the middlemen who may have been able to get in and previously take a cut of this without actually doing anything this allows the artist interface directly with\nUh the publishers here so that you don't necessarily have a middleman the setting prices and so forth so I have long been someone who has said that a lot of musicians in the stream model under compensated and under protected\nThis is not a perfect bill that signed\nBut it gives them a whole bunch of benefits that they didn't have previously in Europe all kinds of artist who have come out in favor of this bill this is a pretty big one\n... it's important to the report on because it's one of\nI don't know maybe two bills that I can think of in the last two years that saw wide bipartisan support so that means that it was do pretty just needed to be done\nYeah this this is a bill that had been introduced I think back in April so took about six months or to to get to the point where it was passed it was passed by the way when we talk about bipartisan support\nFour hundred and Fifteen to zero in the house and unanimously in the Senate so again this is not something where you had people on opposite sides it was pretty much hey this is something that needs to get done here\nIt's somewhat encouraging that you know they're still something that we can all agree on\nThe uh the funny thing that you have here on this um is the original sponsor of the bill a is Senator Orrin hatch um and the the idea of Orrin Hatch being the savior of music is a little bit funny you like it just it's not the person that you would expect\nI Would more expect him to be you know the bad guy from footloose it it's not\nJust comes through on this one uh in knock this one out of the park so really good news for artist hearing again this bill originally sponsored by Bob good a lot in the house and Orrin Hatch in the Senate and getting through a with unanimous support in both houses here\nBMW is going to be buying out a majority stake in their Chinese a division previously they only on twenty five percent of the joint venture they held over in China is going to be helping that Seventy five percent\nYeah and this is all just based on the laws that were in place in her now changing in China so BMW it sound like it was only allowed to own a twenty five percent venture in their\nChinese division and based on the new rules that were going to play some twenty twenty two they're allowed to acquire the majority stake of this joint venture now they still need to have a partnership with the Chinese entity up but there are allowed to own more but you're going to see more of this\nSo it's a I guess an encouraging changing some Chinese policy but it's still to me doesn't change the core of the issue which is if you want to do business in China you must partner with a Chinese company so that they can effectively you know a skilled trade secrets at least have access to them and\nTo give you an idea of how big this is what this does this mean for BMW ... five hundred and sixty thousand cars in China last year\nWhich is more than the United states in Germany combined yeah so this is a big market for the now I anticipate it's going to get bigger as you continue to see more people in China reaching those upper middle class levels\nSo the time we have on this hour of the financial exchange but don't worry we've got a whole lot more coming up in just a little bit [laughter]\n\nOctober New England is full of soft foods that we read all year for which is why my family has brought that are famous for not Thomas high it's Miriam ... Mediterranean marketplace and if you love song you also love our salads with party ancient grains like fat around any greedy and flick roasted Brussels sprouts cranberries and root vegetables stopping\nOn your way home today and pick up one of our homemade soups to enjoy our fresh selections change every day and hydrogen is located in the brick firehouse it poorly Clinton street in western come down and we're all about\nI'm Dave Anthony Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson who's been detained in Turkey for two years released\nWhen does it closed for the day isn't there a circuit breaker that kicks in a while now I Know there might be now there's there's which to be honest I don't think there should be but just because it doesn't do anything now it doesn't um but I you might be right on that I Can't remember the specifics there just because we haven't seen triggered\nUm if you go back to October twenty eighth Nineteen twenty not again October kind of a trend here okay kicked off really be the great depression\nOr with the wall street crash kicking off on the twenty eighth twelve point eight to ... percent so\nThat would be somewhere in the ballpark of around twenty eight hundred points right now and you continue down the list\nYou know it it would be we're talking thousands of points here if we saw five hundred yesterday we saw eight hundred of the day before it's not a whole lot of fun even if you combine those two days into one which doesn't make sense because they're two separate days it still doesn't even get into your ... your twenty worst days in doubt Jones history\nIt's the problems we love talking about the points to\nThe points on the doubt it's irrelevant the percentages on these things that really are relevant factor here\nAnd yeah I mean you know a couple of percent is nothing to sneeze at but it's not a hugely significant amount or the ... the a circuit breakers by the way if you're a C a seven percent decline that is a Fifteen minute halt\nAt Thirteen percent decline is another Fifteen minute halt and if you see a twenty percent declined to any time during the day trading shell halt for the remainder of the trading day so and not really that possible to have a twenty percent plus market decline these days\nIf you want to talk about volatility by the way we look at what happened in October of twenty nine okay\nI'm ten twenty eight on October twenty eighth of Nineteen twenty nine markets fell Thirteen percent\nThe next day you sit there and you say oh gee maybe we'll get a relief rally nope down in additional twelve percent okay so you're pretty much down twenty percent in those two days the following day on the thirtieth bounces back up twelve percent okay\nAnd then five or six days later on the ... of November back down in additional ten percent so like\nYou you talk about what we're seeing now\nI get it it's uncomfortable it's uncomfortable for every one\nThis is all happened before and it's all been way worse ship so take heart in that but hey we've gotten through things that are worse will get through this we will okay let's talk about some good news for Social Security recipients getting a to point eight percent boost the Social Security administration announcing yesterday\nBased on the average benefit people receive is going to be about forty dollars more a month in Americans' pockets\nIn really good news for the last time we talked about this uh was last year and there was a pretty big Social Security boost last year or two of the problem was it got eaten up by everyone is Medicare premiums that does not appear to be happening this time Medicare costs are expected to stay in check this year a\nPart B coverage which covers doctor visits and other types of outpatient care is expected to increase between a dollar fifty and a hundred and thirty five which is an ex credibly wide range but they're not no one to one thirty five right yeah that's not a range oh sorry it's like one thirty four right now I got it\nAdds poorly written growing up uh fifty ... buck fifty to one thirty five exactly so it's not a huge inflation and the health care costs are surprisingly this year so you're going to really see most of that increase in Social Security which is a nice\nSurprise yeah and so again you know for I I Know that sometimes we look at forty dollars and say gee what's that mean for someone for the people who are living just on Social Security which again it's a lot of people I think it's close to forty percent of people\nLive only off their Social Security benefit once they're retired so it's a big chunk of the population\nThat forty dollars a month is real money you know it is something significant okay\nAnd so if it shouldn't be pooh poohed I Know people say oh gee it's only two point eight percent forty dollars a month is real money to a lot of people hear\nIt you know if the difference between being able to pay in some cases for you know certain prescriptions that you may have the ability to you know around the holidays go out and buy a president for a niece and nephew a grand center a granddaughter is someone like that\nSo it's important to see this it's been really tough the last few years when we take a look at Social Security or the Cole is the cost of living adjustment\nIs what they call it um effectively\nIt really has not been significant in recent years the last time that we saw an adjustment this big was two thousand eleven\nAnd the only times we've always seen it twice in the last decade north of two point eight percent other than that it's been all two percent or below so that's a big for the for a lot of folks who are living on a fixed income because I Know that\nYou know we look at the inflation numbers that are out there and we say oh gee you know inflation's pretty tame hey if you're on a fixed budget\nYou know the inflationary cost probably are higher than what the government tells you because of the way that they measure the\nEasy to forget how rampant inflation was back in the late seventies and eighties and Seventy nine or ten percent cola increase right in eighty fourteen percent Ninety eighty one eleven percent that is just crazy\nSo Google a revealing a whole bunch of new devices or with their latest uh you know roll out of uh these different uh you know\nWhat what would you come smart devices I guess for Google smart devices they also about their\nNew version of their picks Will Stone a show it was a bit of a combination of different products for them uh and this is right on the heels of Facebook's owns smart home product which at least from people that I've talked to has been a big flop and bad timing for the company or Google made a pretty smart decision I think with one of their smart home\nProducts what they do ... what what are they talking about doing here so Facebook let's start with what Facebook did which is they put a almost\nLike an iPad type device that uh you can do video chats with within your home and it runs on the Amazon or Alexa smart home device\nGoogle has put out a new product which it looks like it's again it's another smart home product it's using the Google smart devise a but it's mainly use for watching video not performing video calls and the thing that they I think addressed properly is the creepy factor they said\nYou know was this big hang up on the right ... hey were brand new to this industry people are still getting over the fact that there is a speaker in their home listening to them they probably don't want a video camera watching them at the same time so they admitted a camera on their version of this you can't do video conferencing with it\nBut I think that's you know for somebody that's looking for this maybe they're just looking to be able to watch a quick video on how to cook something\nI I think it's a smart move at least for their first at a ration of this\nAre good we're going to take a quick break

so many of them yeah I that I most numbers from my area code or block now yeah which may or may not be a good thing no one is dealing with this problem\nFor in the past week for me for\nI've got I got a ton of them probably I probably average one or two a day I'm near right there there's no there's certainly no governmental organization dealing with that the carriers are definitely not dealing with it\nBut apple and Google are taking it upon themselves to come up with something because they know it's a huge complaint they want people to continue to use their phones obviously a so they are doing something with it and I I like I like a couple of the solutions actually stuff are they talking about\nSo I like the one that Google is doing a particular 'cause I think it's just a need technology but what they're doing is they're going to have they are going to roll out a a screen this call button\nSo if you pop up in your phone and it's raining and you look at the number and you say I think this is garbage there's a screen call button and the Google Assistant will hop on and they'll let the color no hey we're screening this call\nAnd ask them for their name and so you'll be basically just looking at the phone it'll region the transcript of what that person is saying on the phone and you'll be able to say oh yeah it's my\nLong lost cousin Becky and she's calling me or\nDavid ... how would you know that it's your long lost cousin Becky if she was a long long yeah good question I have\nA you know says that but presumably it'll be a lot easier to tell if there's a human on the line or if it's just a you know recording which is Ninety nine percent of these calls that go to your phone so I liked that technology apple is treating in a different way they're trying to look at the data behind the incoming call to determine whether they're you know\nLegitimate or whether they're you know for an Internet calls with a fake phone number\nI don't understand the technology behind how they do that but if they do it well then that can be a good solution as well they need to do something yeah somebody's got off the weird part is is that the location is like the next town over from me every time oh yeah oh every ... or or where\nI did go through a brief maybe two or three month period where I was getting a lot of calls from Nevada but that might have just been 'cause I had been at a casino prior to that and who knows\nYou owe somebody you some money it wouldn't be phone calls [laughter] you never know we're not on the door and exactly\nA story out of the wall Street Journal today according to a number of economists\nUh that were surveyed by the wall Street Journal or they are relatively ambivalent on this new deal with Canada and Mexico saying it's probably not going to boost the number of manufacturing jobs because of the changes are largely on the periphery and not really directed at any core component\nAnd this is this is off the data you know it's it's polling economists to determine what they think is going to happen and\nFrankly economists aren't always write a Seventy percent of them said that they don't expect to big changes in the U.S economy [laughter] I'm among them I don't think that the new the written NAFTA deal is all that big of a change so I wouldn't expect a huge impact the economy either\nUm but you know I think there are parts of it there were largely good for the U.S economy and even if it's around the periphery it's something\nA largely takes the worst case scenario of not getting a deal off the table right I think that's
