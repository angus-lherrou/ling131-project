still airs it and here's a here's your explaining why they still aired it\nWhere overall out all that she said her story our reporting we want to be very transparent because they are very serious

that\nOne I wouldn't ... that woman I wouldn't feel bad about I'd say gee I I I Am sorry that that\nUh you're alleging that you were a victim of a of a of a rape but I'm the rest of your story

under by a crocodile\nLast time it was me you went back yeah Everytime so NBC put this woman on why because\nThey were going to get eyeballs but we also know the other reason why they put her on\nThe other reason they put her on is because it fits their narrative now\nIt gets worse how about this one\nLetter was sent to\nThe Senate Judiciary committee\nSigned Jane Doe [noise]\nEight says this

... the world's rules you know so I'm going to live by them well Dana Pullman is a big fat slob and\nHe stepped down as head of the state police union\nLast friday why I'm On a kind of predicted Dana Pullman is gonna model up to a photo finish with a grand jury\nI'm not a fan of Dana pull him and now you may say well wait a minute Jim state police union you support\nPublic employee unions for public safety nothing else but public said yeah\nThat doesn't mean that I blindly support them I don't support Dana Poland first of all Dana Pullman is head of the union\nProbably wouldn't have been able to pass the physical to get back on to the force okay that's\nWhy I started this out as saying he's a big fat slob but he is and hey look I'm a radio guy as long as ... wiring ... works and my brain works\nAnd my ears work\nThat's all I Need to do the job but your head of the state police union oh wait a minute you were head of the state police union you roof stepped down for\nReasons now\nIf I'm wrong\nAnd you truly have stepped down for personal reasons\nApologize\nI won't apologize for calling you a big fat slob because you were state trooper okay you may be head of the union but you're still a state trooper you should still be able to do the job\nCould get past the ... test\nYeah that's just so we need a state trooper who can't shoot straight\nI don't know I don't know but it doesn't matter now the question is moot it doesn't matter\nDana Pullman is at to step down why we give me so much attention to this guy\nWell one he\nStepped out on friday\nSaid it was for personal reasons\nI was waiting for the old I Want to spend more time with my family but it didn't come out of personal reasons okay\nThen a little bit while after that\nA report came out that a grand jury\nIs investigating investigating the\nUm [noise] the possibility\nOf illegal campaign contributions political contributions\nComing out of the state police union ... how could that happen well we all know you have to I'm just pay in Europe require men's then they'd be limited amounts of money and you can't do fundraising when you're a public employee well here's what the grand jury is investigating\nMembers of the executive board of the union\nAre alleged to have been making political contributions with money from the union\nNow you can't do that how are they doing it well here's how they were doing it\nA member of the board allegedly would write out a nice big fat check for some politician\nUnion would dream burst that member\nFor making that contribution that's called money laundering that's called an illegal campaign contribution\nAnd if that was going on it doesn't matter who the money was going to because whoever the money was going to even really\nThe person who should be in trouble\nUnless they had knowledge that this was going on\nBut the people who are in trouble or the union and this is I'll get back to Dana Pullman but this is another example of why I don't like public employee unions I tolerate them for public safety people\nThe reason I tolerate them for public safety people is I actually feel that our police are firefighters and our EMTs people like that\nAre kind of like soldiers and they should be treated accordingly because like soldiers they are putting their lives on the line for us yes even if you're an EMT you try to hold down a junkie sometime so even\nThat these folks I Believe that they do\nDeserve some extra protections in some extra treatment I think in some respects um there are too many extra protections in the commonwealth given to state police\nAll the the um some of the uh some of the pensions like the one Marion McGovern got\nBad hack that she got with their heart problem she's collecting a large amount of money\nClaiming she had a heart problem and yet that heart problem didn't stop her from running the state police also that heart problem didn't didn't stop her from protecting [noise]\nYou could learn a lot from a dummy I almost had a governance and Mari bucket your safety belt\nYeah Marion McGovern I'm a member of the McGovern crime family she's collecting some serious money right now retirement I think she lives in ducks Barry otherwise known as the ... yeah she was the one that really a ... ... ... is with state police\nCovered the whole thing for Tim Murray like don't releases phone records don't release the black box from his car she took care of that data Pullman I Believe was also part of that\nBut here's what's worse about Dana Pullman\nOh boy we finished the union thing I'm Sorry the reason why I don't like public employee unions as they are giving money to the other side of the table now having been in\nAny union and been an officer and a union you go to the table and management goes to the other side of the table and then they negotiate\nThere's no hey I'm gonna I'm gonna do something really nice for management so that they'll be better to us with the company's money that doesn't happen well that's what happens with public employee unions\nThere are over there greasing the other side of the table and that's what Dana Pullman and these guys were alleged to have been doing\nOh and by the way you members of the union with your money\nIllegally that's the allegation\nSo let's go back to Dana Pullman data this is the first time Dana Pullman spent and they had a little um\nA crisis of of morals\nDana Pullman was a guy who didn't go and was told he wouldn't go any higher in the state police because he got pinched for padding his time sheet\nYet\nStill got reelected his way was I'll show these guys I'll become head of the state police union okay\n\nWhat's the connection to Dana Pullman now remember rally ... remember the alley be bouquets Dana Pullman has been pulling the strings\nIn that case now I Know there's people in the audience right now saying well Jim ... the strings should have been\nPulled them out there really should have I mean that\nWas wrong we've got some evidence here that that was wrong okay we'll see how it all shakes out but let me tell you something Dana Pullman has been working behind the scenes on that\nTo make it even bigger\nAnd on top of all of that Dana Pullman I'm sure\nHad knowledge that\nHis state troopers wear padding their time sheets like keep padded his time she what did we hear from him [noise]\nAnd rarely morally how could that man\nBe in charge of an organization\nAnd for the most amount of money real estate agents I trust dot com [noise]\nMy clock is ticking everyday you

to correlate pretty well in general with overall earnings of global corporations just because South Korea so heavy for manufacturing and they're they're they're they're kind of this key\nCountry where they export both to Asia which is growing rapidly\nAnd they're also big in terms of exports to Europe and the U.S which were developed there his Samsung exactly Samsung elegy those types of companies

twenties sixteen when we are all that money coming out of the global economy because of oil prices crying\nSo this is one of those things where I take a look at the chart and this number by the way if you go back a year okay\nA year ago that number was ... plus thirty four percent\nYou know he and a lot of people would have thought that number would be increasing because you're hearing about American companies like a Costco stockpiling Walmart is stockpiling product because they're anticipating these tariffs\nAnd and I think what this suggests to me you could see\nThat what could you know you mentioned hey you know not enough workers can kick off the next recession\nIt could also be what we call an inventory recession where companies have stockpiled so much product that they say look we don't need to order anything else in factory orders low for a couple of quarters and it puts you into a mild recession that doesn't mean the world comes to an end but it it does mean that hey you

having difficulty hiring workers not a day goes by where we don't report on labor strikes for somebody's going out on strike or work or like a Mariette workers just went out on strike [laughter]\nWhat's the problem with labor markets overheating\n[noise] it means that wages go up and in the short term corporate profits go down why is that a bad thing\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing in the long term in the short term it can cause a state if all of a sudden Mariette Mrs their earnings estimates\nQuarter after quarter because they have to pay their workers more money or Amazon or a BJ's or Cosco all these companies have to pay more money for their workers in the short term it hits their earnings per share in Wall Street will cause those stocks to go down may not be bad for the economy in the economy might actually benefit from higher wages to lower paid work\nIn my view also is that stress is stress stress is what produces forward progress in technology and into the economy it's when you have a company that saying gee we can't figure out how to ... earnings because our costs are going up to watch\nIt it's not a question of hey we don't have enough sales we can make it say what what will queens what can we do to innovate to figure out how to to generate better profit and I like to see that 'cause that's where a company like marriage says\nGee you know what we're going to figure out a way we're going to get better technology for our cleaning staff so that instead of cleaning eight rooms a day they can do nine and instead of\nUh having our kitchen work in this way we're going to have that I like to see that I I like companies that are a little stress because it forces them to innovate sure I don't like when companies are all comfortable saying

Boston western Boston waterfront western Copley Place\nThey voted uh and and they now are going on strike actually happens to those hotels and clean your own damn tell they're going to have they are going to cave they gotta pay now granted some of the workers stuff that they're asking for here is a little nutty okay there's one thing to say hey we want to get paid and we want to have you know raises the next few years now\nEmotional health comes from brain how brain health depends on property attrition\nWhat are the biggest obstacles to getting people proper nutrition looking specifically at the United states\nSpecifically we eat the wrong food and it it's pretty straightforward you look at what American you know it's no mystery why we're struggling or wait where we struggle heart disease and diabetes we eat\nToo many simple sugars refined carbs and ... and I think one of the problem really is people have a hard time understanding the incentive and they're significant incentives physically financial as changing or you eat and and and be pleasurable a delicious food all day long but\nKnow you look at the ... driver of disability in a worldwide and to be an American is clinical depression sucks more from our economy than any other illness where we have a preventative solution like food it's just it makes common sense for all of us are really incorporate that as as I Would think about eating\nAnd and and we obviously tend to look at things from a business in dollars and cents perspective being you know business focused show we know that the cost of depression both in it you know last worker hours and and medical bills and so forth is the ... year do we have any idea how much of that costs could be offset by simply eating properly\nWell let's do eating properly and exercise 'cause there's no doubt who lifestyle changes that their significant data so that data about the Russians for example looking at dietary pattern and depression rates you see is thirty to fifty per cent reduction\nSo as a billions and billions of dollars no matter how you count it also you know there's that ... eating better it costs more the most recent study smiles trial by fleece jackets showed that individuals on a Mediterranean diet with the question said the hundred and forty Australian dollars every month\nTo what you're seeing is is the savings for the individual and then you just have that\nThat part you can't quantify with numbers which is the price of human smile happier people they built better relationships better ... better families\nAnd so it just it makes them on all levels and and also from the finance standpoint we have to national killed day to day guys founder national kale they just look at kale is a phenomenon goes health wise though the average American before we started\nA national kill they had two cups of ... per year now there's more that more than that uh that killed a great example really really inexpensive food easy to grow very accessible to all Americans and easy to make delicious it's a it's such a great example are very welcome nutrient dense brain food\nDoctor how long does it take for a change in diet to have a measurable impact on someone the overall sense of wellbeing and so forth\nIs so there's the acute effect which side of the brain food let's see both act which look everybody can test is that they want you to go home tonight and celebrate national kill they eat some kale eat some um you know really healthy proteins you like like a wild salmon\nSeafood out good choice and avoid the bad stuff and everybody listening you don't know what that is the how you feel today and tomorrow you're going to feel a little better 'cause you've made a better choice believes that short term\nYou know winning the fight for ourselves but the Alps mood and then in terms of overall brain affects all the really the we'd be trying to think about brain health now it's not just about they're going in that about brain growth in Barrow plasticity\nAnd those changes when you get your brain into what what I call ... ... vote you're talking for weeks to eight weeks is getting that no more robust anti depressant effect and then really the longer term which is leading for brand elderly doesn't lead to weight loss but a lot of people\nThat you know six months down the road you have more money 'cause you're eating in a more mindful way you're connected to your food lost weight and feel better so those are kind of the the the timeline of the brain defect\nDoctor would say that I have a real soft spot for a five guys burger and fries and despite my best efforts I still have one of those every couple of weeks or so is that something that completely the rails this or is that bill okay to do with ...\nYou know I thought I recognized different someplace that's five guys there are a couple of weeks so I Love a brokered fries um and I was a vegetarian for about gosh over a decade and the reason I ... I mean there are number Trish there are ways to do it but\nYou know the basic idea is don't ... based on fast food if every couple of weeks you have a hamburger and fries I don't think that the real anything and I think it actually helps people I\nI don't like the notion of that the quote unquote cheap day yup because I'm not I'm not a cheater and I don't like cheating and I don't like asking eaters I think the heat that burger with respect for where it came from with with the mindfulness the overall cost right that's cheap for you but that's expensive for the planet that burger prize\nAnd and you think about uh [noise] all of the ways to make that healthier like we go to Wendy's lot her kids because it's inexpensive and you and we get double vegetable\nAbout the healthiest meal but twice as many vegetables are so they're all kinds of little ways especially even fast food restaurant to poll is a great example is fast food but you can go and you can order in a way that's off right now or you can go load up on black beans enough ... and corn tortillas and eating with great for your brain\nVery good outstanding doctor thank you for joining us today we really appreciate it\nThat's my pleasure folks are interested check out to my website ... if you'd ... um that we've got an e course depression the folks rich took to learn more but I really appreciate you guess focusing on

by\nChance I'm having a kale and chicken salad for lunch or there you go do just that the that was what I desire just by chance it by ... it's eating healthy is kind of a pain in the neck\nThough like ... it's it's have you heard it in his first wore out though like uh let's see giving example pineapple is really good for you know ... it takes like five ten minutes to ... went up ... white grapes or grapes are good for you today there at all after that that too\nBut he uh preparing a salad it's easier to like you said go order Chinese food than it is to prepare us out and eat healthy that's
