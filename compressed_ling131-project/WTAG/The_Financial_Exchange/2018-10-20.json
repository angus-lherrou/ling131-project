lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his drinking\nHe said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much like way way too much so it's a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live about a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that he would drink too much sometimes\n... the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop that but it was pathetic which goes to show that they have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all in on this stuff\nBut that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said to them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nKnow it would never occur to me and I know never heard any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what the hand for publicly when it ... it just would never occur to me now\nI'm not saying to talk to somebody to gauge somebody and if you want it's an elected represented ... but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation and\nThis is not meant to in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted Cruz they're mob and Ted Cruz this is what they do they like to foreign mobs\nAnd also reminded me when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want you I just had so much else going on there but you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assault\nAnd that's\nIf if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves you know support and sympathy\nBut that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well it it because something bad happened\nTo me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced\nBy that that's that's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I had a uh I I was on trial for a steely right I was in ... for fraud\nAnd people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant\nBut for the left it was a widespread talking point a whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too are there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come forward and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for contracts and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not\nThis is really elementary stuff and that this was a something that people are losing sight of and a lot of people are losing sight of just I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass hysteria in this country that Democrats have reached this point where\nI don't think that the king a logical about many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want your show rage and they want to signal to average you to the world\nAnd they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect that other people will listen to that other people here are their thoughts and because ... there's so much claiming of victims status now when everyone's saying oh I'm a victim so you have to listen to me\nAh their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification then becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality and to bring this back with Trump is saying here you know do you want\nPeople who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that the left has been

I heard that ankle break you know but ... another version of that Nikki Haley there at the Al Smith dinner or talking about the Elizabeth Warren just I don't know I mean the Elizabeth Warren maneuver earlier this week I Know we've talked about a lot about going to get much more into it now\nBut that was the equivalent the political equivalent of being the incredibly Sean burned\nPudgy kid who in

that the ... that's politically what Elizabeth Warren did here you're just like oh my gosh what is wrong with you\nAnd see and I got caught up in a too but you should have gone back and seeing the the

group\n... group is the same folks who bought the Frank carols building on main street they also bought the old performing arts building on chat I'm sure you got to do so much of that yeah the chatter street they're going to start construction in um the spring I just talked to Paul Miranda who left the city went to work for them\nUm and they're starting construction the springtime to turn that into housing or the ... street uh yours I asked for all the old days there really is I mean you know there's the people particularly want that kind of downtown housing and some of these\nRetro fitted buildings they are there different they're not like cookie cutter are they going to have exposed brick you know unique characteristics uh and sometimes views that are performing arts when actually gets a pretty tall so you get some good views of city hall and in Union Station beyond [noise]\nUm [noise] they also purchased the shacks building and if you drive by you see that taking the facade off the building and they're going to restore the old historic character of the buildings\nAre they burn working with legal aid who's on one floor maybe about spending a to a second floor and then returning the retail to the first level so and again we've done what we can we'll be doing the main street project but we did the summer's mechanic street so the other side of the building has all new straightened sidewalk there we didn't know what you treat\n'em so\nWe're really trying to work hand in glove with developers saying hey you know you do what you can we'll do our public infrastructure improvements or the city council is going to get the new ... district the business improvement district\nOr they had sixty percent of the downtown uh landlords sign onto this they're going to impose an additional tax on themselves\nUm they're going to have a pool of money and they're going to do extra amenities in the downtown area they want snow removal they want to do extra plant is going to have actually hire staff that you'll see out and about you know doing programming of the downtown area a lot of cities have this um it's a huge part of\nMaking sure that the ... district and it could be anywhere I think the canal district would be a great second ... district where people come together and say we want a little bit more than the city can provide and will do it ourselves a pull our resources and really take things\nFor the last time I ever saw that was in times square Neal you exactly that is I mean there are ... ... when I was there they should have the ... all the time a business and uh\nAnd finally the emergence of times we're in New York should help the dumps they've got together for the ... district together and have people out there sweeping up cleaning up and keep it in and do an activity and all of a sudden there's\nThere's people swarmed this terrible dismal awful middle of downtown New York in which an active place you could go and you didn't have any say here's what I say I don't know All right let's say a break it's this commercial and then we'll wrap\nFor ... for all of them are\nHorrible proper her car [noise] I Know we're probably about ... what about an\nArgument or how about provide problem from also\nOn comic or report\nWhether movies\nOh saving money grabbers better light good\nEvery single facet live these news radio fight\n... UTA gee [noise]\n\n[noise] that that will be the greatest ally back\nYou're just sort of ... commission you have a day do you want to tell everybody about yeah I'm going to want to repeat that uh the integrated planning meetings for those that are interested in and they should be a it's it's the future of your water and sewage bills but also\nHow we were like you don't like the environment in in our in our infrastructure that's again on November ate at six thirty at the library we welcome you to come we do have on the city's website a clean what's your water page\nThat anyone can go look at and we have a survey there people want to take it and let us know their thoughts so uh we we welcome every once in put a little help the planning long run\nAnd run around in Congress needs to stand or fall off the trees and you're in a jam it was chilly this morning to you and I know I Know a show you you will be I'm standing on leaves and ... and leaves\nIt it's a good thing to remember the reason why we pick up all ages actually as a ... thing it it keeps them out of the drains it keeps us leaves him getting into the books and streams and\nAdding to foster ... problems in in in other things show will be standing at the ... on November ... Monday just before\nThe ... election we were going to stand on election with ... and as usual is that downtown because there's still leaves left to fall down town where they were you know the density of trees the smallest sat there and then we'll work our way out\nIs usually try to do the whole program in five weeks or so we get it done hopefully knock on paper before the fresh smell so we'll work six days a week for five weeks we'll have daily updates in the paper or social media or on the city's website you know where we are way there's no parking we certainly don't want to\nGive people tickets into cash so we want people in the time comes\nYou know to ask questions give us a call we'll give you all the information we can [noise] ah we will be handing I'll remind the flyers are on election day and actually during the early voting was going to have a ... you'd be hitting all flies to voters who do you know go to the polls show just one way to get to people\nNational I'd have to worry about leaves anymore\nNow that the U.S somebody to take\nCare of it had no ... without any more than one letter\nJust that uh you know as Paul said the dreaded words winter word to remind people will be doing some social media campaigns as well I signed up for alert west or if you haven't done that that's an important issue for a way to know when you know we're doing the leaf pick up in your neighborhood or changing you know the date\nBecause of some weather events and to know when we put it in the winter parking bans as we get closer to that sees its way to stay in touch them and make sure you go to all the information in\n... you're trying to give us we appreciate that was at a map mostly tonight and we'll be back tomorrow we'll do it all over you actually will everybody and don't worry be happy [noise]\nWho yeah I think there is a you know one clients coming in fact we had one ah last week that that came in and they really wanted to protect us the the big time listeners they said we listen all the time or we we came down and one of the reasons we were coming down was to do\nNursing home planning you know we really want to protect that but also to do estate planning because all we have as a will and we know from listening to you that uh will is really a won't and and we want\nMore than that I said okay fine but remember I ensues and you know when we're in meetings together we don't we may talk about Medicaid trust a lot but we don't\nDo them as a matter of course right we look at the clients assets that type of assets the dollar value of the assets the age of the client and the family dynamics of the client and all of that factors into whether or not\nThe recommendation of an irrevocably trust might be there\nBecause I Know when you sit down people Todd you go through all of their objectives right in a nursing home planning and protection isn't one of them you don't discuss theory will try\nAnd I think you're right Susan when you say they're object 'cause I I use the word recommendation and and we don't really tell people whether they should protect us from a nursing home they need to decide if that's important to them so I went through this with this particular client and they did seem to want to protect us from the nursing home\nBut when I looked at the numbers they were worth about six million\nMhm not never mind the six million isn't what's putting me off four point five million of it was\nIn an Ira wow I said\nI Can't do Medicaid planning for you was for a million dollars in an IRA ... and I explained to them right even if you wanted to protect the other two property such a hat and some other money\nWhich we could do you'll never be eligible for Medicaid mhm because of the Ira and even if\nI was to try to do the Ira last minute planning which is the only thing we can do for IRAs and we've explained that on the show we can do last minute planning for an Ira\nBut in this case it was his and if he got sick and what in the nursing home in order for me to a movie Ira permissible early to the healthy spouse I'd\nHave to cash it out oh and think about that tax though if they weren't millions on point four million I ran a numbers I said there's no way we're going to write a check for one point four million just so I can get you his Ira right start paying the nursing home because even if he lives three years at fourteen thousand a pop it's like four fifty\nYeah I Can't stomach one point four million in tax and then can you imagine if you made the transfer thinking he's got a little while and six months later he has some catastrophic something happens in the nursing home and he dies right now you spent one point four million in taxes when you would not have needed to do that\nRight and that money coming out of the IRA although normally it's taxable completely when you take that money out of the IRA in this case if their private private pay with only arraigned money tax benefit\nOf choices and you'll get adoption for the uh for the money you're using just spend on the nursing home so you're actually believing it out almost not quite tax free but just just about yeah get a big deduction\nFor your ah medical expense so yes I think we educate we don't advocate one over the other it's very important that you come in and see where you're at\nSo we know that you can't put those IRA acids whether it's traditional area Roth IRA although you don't have the tax implication of Iraq I re but\nAnything that's still in that IRA rapper cannot go into that tries not not an advance know what else would you put into the trust while you're going through this process for someone who is in heavy on the IRA side they decide they want to do their evoke about trust planning what kind of assets would you actually transfer into that this\nThis well when now let's go to someone who who's more of the everyday client right you you've got three million unless you're likely to be there's really no question that you you'll probably concerned about nursing home care right and so now you've got that vacation home your primary residence those are two usually big assets that people want to protect\nThey can go in ... right and usually they're there's also maybe an investment portfolio\nThey would want to put some of that and that can go in ... not the Ira but the taxable investment portfolio\nOr even or even a rental property 'cause remember when you put the rental property and you still get the right to the income right so it's still yours you haven't given it away in that regard and so yeah they can put the rental property in and and get that protected so pretty much anything you want to protect others and the Iraq and put in\nWhich is great so you you have that flexibility get that clock started and you know what it's it's really about education this whole process tied everything that we do on this show is to educate people even if it's when they go and sit down with someone else another attorney to get their ... their documents drafted\nIn the back of their mind they can be thinking\nHuh I don't think that's what Todd said oh no they were able to do so we know that there's a lot of bad legal advice out there yet are only ... and I think part of the reason\nWe this this do we do this article this way is it it does provide you with some of that information about how to begin the process how to decide what belongs in what doesn't belong and things like that so\nAnd and how to to know when to do it right I had a forty nine year old couple come in now they got young kids miners you know this is not yeah not ready for that\nYet you need to do regular estate planning and they did need to do it you know and and I'm certain that they will but ah but\nSo yeah it's not

currently interest rates are on the rise in in the past three weeks alone the ten year treasury has jumped from two point nine nine percent to three point to three percent now we've kind of settled back down around three point one five percent do you think this is a sign for investors to pull out of the stock market\nOr you're right in the streets are on the rise but it's really nothing out of the norm or a ... three two three is actually below the historical average\nFor the ten year treasury but you know thanks to a decade a very low interest rates following the Oneida financial crisis the economy has become accustomed to these lower rates which is why we saw the large sell off in\nThe stock market the last couple of weeks contrary to popular belief stocks don't always fall when interest rates rise rates typically rising the economy's strong which is also the main driver of equity returns according to parents have been\nFifteen periods in the past sixty five years when rates have risen in stocks have gained with average gains reaching twelve and a half percent and they're only been three instances and those rising rate environments when stocks of actually fallen\nSo what sector is can we invest in that could actually benefit from a rising interest rate environment\nWell I mean one sector that benefits typically from rising interest rate is financials are banks make money by you know buying deposit cheaply and then selling them for higher prices while higher interest rates will force them to pay more for deposits and straight on savings accounts and other consumer products typically rise much slower\nThan interest rates on loans you know the average rate on a one year CD for instance climbed from point to seven to point seven eight and started sixteen whereas the home equity line of credit rate went from four six nine to six point one nine percent\nThings Mac folks if you have questions about the market about the economy or about your portfolio please visit us it Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with time ... and Susan Powers [noise]\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that's including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan or [noise]\nCaught a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Bob in Boston mass imbibe rights I'm interested in protecting my sons inherited his inheritance from creditors however if he remains married and then ... says his wife\nHow can I include her in my plan so that she would receive something after he dies but keep the majority of the assets interest from my grandkids so he wants to include the daughter in law and his plan\nThis is very strange [laughter] well um I I said I don't really feel the same way yeah [laughter] but you know I mean I I Do understand that you know ... you think you know that you want to you know you you love you\nOr in laws and even though you're really only think your love your in laws are but\nAnd and you want to try to take care of and it's kinda hard to have your cake and eat it too though [laughter] so what I Would what I Would think you would have to do is you would just have to say that you know upon I think in in the trust Bob you create you would say upon my death\nYou know if my son is married ... make sure they're married on the date of death right so if my son is married to acts on the date of death then I Want to carve out you know a percentage some percentage to\n... her just give it to her you know a little piece of even even if the sun's living 'cause they'll share together mhm right\nIf if if it's something you want her to have and you ... and since you want her to have it you really don't\nCare about it being ... the divorce comes or not you don't care because you're giving it to her than than than give it to her and then her but even if the sun's living they can enjoy it together\nIf they get a divorce or whatever you gave to your daughter in law would be subject to the divorce which means your son would get half\nAnd she would get half so it's not horrific as long as you put a percentage on the amount you want to go to her\nAnd then you say the balance of the assets so say I carve out ten percent of my state mhm I Want you know ten maybe even five percent I Won five percent of my assets are and and maybe you would even limited you might not want real estate to get involved here so you might say I want five percent of my non\nA real estate trust assets\nTo go to a share for the benefit of my uh daughter in law provided she is married to my son on the date of my death ...\nUh and that share can be paid out directly to her again\n... if they're married and sons living than they have it together so it's kinda like you gave it to your son right no different than if you paid it out to your Sunday would share it yep same idea\nOkay so that's off the table then the balance of the trust assets Ninety five percent of what's left ... would be held in this\nTrust designed for future creditor protection divorces and bloodline planning down to the grand kids which is what he's asking about here so I think Bob you're going to have to get the lawyer to get some creative drafting\nBut I have yet to come across the situation that we could not accomplish one way or another just have to understand the pros and cons of doing it\nI Would not want to put it all in the divorce proof language trust where it's supposed to pay out in the trustees discretion for the donor or or for the children and the grandchildren and the spouse of the sun\nTo me that just smells really bad ... I mean if the divorce comes later and\nShe says her attorney takes a look at that language right and she says you know I'd like half of what's in that trust that Bob put together yet right and\nBob says well it's not mine or ours we always have to ask the disinterested trust the for the distribution I suppose the disinterested trustee could say no\nEven though it's right for ... but it but because it's for one of the beneficiaries the right ... right I just don't I don't like it I don't like how it feels\nI Would think that he could then are you to say wait a minute she NPR both beneficiaries of this divorce poof bucket this kind of who's so yeah I get that plane\nYeah but I still think that to disinterested trustee ultimately could say no I don't have to give it to anybody if I don't want to rent and and it would probably work out but if it were me I cut the making lean I'd cut it off I'd say you know what\nWhatever piece you want her to have give it to her and put the rest in the divorce proof trust for children grandchildren spouses are out okay\nGood advice there folks Todd has put a lot of good advice in writing for you with his guy designing in income only ... trust he\nHas written this guide for the month of October ... gives you a great foundation of knowledge when you were starting out in the process of having your trust drafter igloo clued\nThe important information that must be in your trust in sixteen troublesome provisions that absolutely should not be in your trust\nYou can request you're free copy\nOf Todd's designing your ... trust guide right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show\nDot com taught our last question comes from Janice in Milton massing Janice writes I Am I on the power of attorney and she is now in a nursing home we are private paying at twelve thousand dollars per month\nShe only has a home and we're in the process of selling it because I can no longer maintain it and I'm not in a position to be able to rent it is there anything that can be done last minute to protect the two hundred and fifty thousand that we will receive and proceeds from the sale of the house [noise]\nYeah that's too bad I'm I'm going to spend just a few minutes on the part that they said they can't do and and really explore that you know I Know clients say they can't rent it or you know they're not in a position I mean to me rent it but you're always better off\nKeeping the house I think mhm than selling it in a house ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Worcester", "day": "20"}
