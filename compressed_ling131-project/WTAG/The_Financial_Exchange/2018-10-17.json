something I've I've got to have one\nOne of the top and then one does support the bottom out is so that's basically how she's holding it which is where does she have it in the all around bear hug\nNo no no she had one hand on the bottom one hand on the top and it's almost like like I have never held disappear before it's not a wine glass filled with chard may so I don't know how to do this which I don't have a problem with per se is you know uh\nMy wife has never held a beer bottle 'cause she doesn't like beer right so I ... have a problem with her not liking fear but when she pretends to be I'm clearly tell but she doesn't she had on the issue right exactly\nExactly Steve come on this was all set up and Democrats are mad at her\nFor dropping this yesterday\nThen by the way this explains her visit to Holyoke when she went to the town hall in the city hall auditorium\nAnd said I'm going to take a hard look at it and now the wording in the globe was hard evidence\nThat she's a native person then did not tell you guys yesterday Danny I can say go to the tape but did not tell you guys yesterday that everybody else who's going to pick up on the headline and that's all you were guinea here all day yesterday was the head of terrible\nYeah everybody was using that nobody ever heard of it is that what it was hard evidence yeah some some some phrase something and and that ...\nYeah that's why she gave it to the globe 'cause she knew the globe would write a sympathetic story\nAnd the story first of all had the big mistake in it right the glove didn't do their math how how do you do that an important story like that and you didn't do your math\nAnd and you had to correct it later and then the New York times now obviously the New York times which used to own the Boston Globe the New York times says hey we're gonna teach them a lesson\nYou guys did you math wrong you got it all wrong ... yeah but the narrative in the main idea what they wanted to portray with the headline is bucket out there so the Democratic seat any drug take back not many people are going to see that here's the thing\nIf you bought the print edition of the globe it's sad proves I'm native ancestry\nIn the online version the version we add the headline was um releases releases results of DNA test\nSo the the headline in the newspaper was real and I mean and the print copy was really pushing it I mean that was a slanted story look this was all coordinated she already had the video down\nSo that's why in in Holyoke she said I'll drop the answer there\nAnd then she drops this story on the globe are friends there at the globe do the story for her [noise]\nAnd then she releases the campaign video on our website where she's down in Oklahoma drinking beer with her brothers and then she pulls out some cousin\nWho's part of the Cherokee Nation but we don't really know the connection\nTo this cousin\nIs that cousin Cherokee by ... by um by their parents' marriage\nIs this ... you know I mean did someone in her family marry\nSomeone who was who had native blood and then she had this cousin so she can pull this cousin out when in fact it's got nothing to do with her blood gets the blood that that that\nCousins mother or father married into just ridiculous and I want to stay on the subject of the of the globe\nBecause they are they're continuing with the Aaron Hernandez story and I know I'm giving I'm promoting it by talking about it but it is such a waste of time and so insulting\nIf I were a member of old and Lloyd's family God\nWould I be what I I it's enough to

there uh but as it turns out they were detained at the border of Guatemala but police after about two hours let them through so they this is continuing into Guatemala\nFinal final word do we going to have another one of these things where everybody Russia's the border like happened before\nI don't think so again because it that they've got a ways to go here according to my inaccurate estimation it

G. dot com keyword weather [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo I'll get back to society it's\nTime to delve into the Democrats cabinet craziness again only because it's not over it's almost like the end of the friday the thirteenth film or a hollow wean you know Mike Myers Jason always comes back well\nWas the Kavanaugh\nA dress rehearsal\nFor Trump's impeachment or\nFree zone impede chore for cabinet us impeachment look let's get someone on board who's got really the Inside Story he's a former Trump campaign advisor Michael ... Michael thanks so much for joining us this morning\nHey my question factor invite\nNo problems so Michael it's an interesting premise why don't you put some meat on those bones\nWelfare but it's really quite a A R typical Washington inside the beltway story\nOr much of what you saw all of us saw on television as info that started out with the people standing up and screaming during the uh the uh the Kavanaugh\nOr confirmation hearings and the gathered outside and and the crowd\nAnd then people came in and started running up and down the hall and I caught the amateur trapping them an elevator and enter came all the way to the point where after confirmation they tried to take over the Supreme Court it's off the this is all\nJust a practice run these are people in groups that have ... that are working together to rectify national Democrats or who to protest\nAnd and all of the government and do everything moves and their director until they get their way yeah hidden Kavanaugh because they simply didn't have the vote\nIn the United States Senate but that's only one hundred people you know in the house of representatives were they've got four hundred and thirty five people that will be voting on impeachment it's really quite a possibility that the president of the United states will be peace and justice Kavanaugh will be nice\nIf the Democrats take over the house of representatives everything we saw during the Kavanaugh confirmations brought the yelling ranting and raving the screaming or the their lives and and the complete map of destruction of a good man and his family battle be on display if you're like that\nYou're going to last night saying that the Democrats take it over\nWe're talking with Michael ... former Trump campaign adviser and uh certainly on the inside track in DC I'm\nLet let me ask you this though ... don't you think there were a portion of people\nWho saw the behavior of the mob the Democrats saw that it was astro turf that a lot of this was paid for don't you think that those people maybe were turned off I Know the\nPerson who doesn't pay attention to the news like usually a listener to this show would may be fooled but aren't there a good number of people who maybe were turned off by it\nAll the polls show that not only Republicans were turned off by it\nBut a good job of independents and even some Democrats repairing\nWell this is way too far and we've gone way too far and and I think that the Democrats truly overplay their hand a lot of people who for example you know we call ourselves the deplorable the people who came out to vote for President Trump\nOr maybe even when they're first time voting for a long long time\nYou know they may not have come out during the mid term elections because while President Trump isn't actually on the ballot\nAnd they really only have voted for the part of the outsider candidate Donald Trump\nThey might have stayed home but actually they're starting to uh respond upholstery thing they understand that this Kavanaugh thing as an example of how walking more run after the midterm if the Democrats take over and they realize it will blow\nOr completely stop the president's agenda\nAnd probably in many ways reverse the economy the strong right now we're you know the jobless rate or the lowest they've ever been in in in recent times\nAnd they understand that if they don't get out and vote even though the president himself as a physically on the ballot the president's agenda will be will be will be all completely so a lot of people who thought if you have your uh I understood that it was at her and\nThen it would be have or that was beyond the pale they're getting out the vote but if any of your weapon or are considering staying home on election day a huge mistake\nYeah we we we make that message to every one all of the time\nI'm Mike if they if the Democrats regain\nCongress even if it's by one vote are you willing to say even if it's by one vote and they will definitely try to bring up articles of impeachment\nI'll tell you ... you know anything that happens on a on the floor of the house of representatives in the United States Senate is always accompanied with some kind of head count the thumb leaders of the Democratic party now trying to judge\nThe more radical members and the more radical candidates and trying to stop them from talking about impeachment but in reality my understanding is that the ... going on in the back rooms in the caucuses are the Democratic party the fact that the party is so radicalized al ... who Trump pay you know they really don't have\nAn agenda ... higher agenda on the campaign trail is stopping Trump hating Trump hating on Trump to point even thought but there do can do by this\nBut they will at least try to do it\nAnd if they fail it in ... meant they certainly will do whatever they can stop the president ever return so if you if they fail to abuse them they're certainly going to turn the economy around and do things that are ... agenda\nStrangest so people know the house springs up the articles of impeachment the trial is held in the Senate if the Senate or to vote along party lines um I think even after these midterms Republicans maintain control the Senate\nUm need the impeachment wouldn't go through but Michael what you're saying is it's just the disruption the distraction it may not be successful but it'll be a distraction\nThat and if you look at the present a program you know the and foreign policy is a you know interactions with North Korea and South Korea trying to bring them together a denuclearize the law you know his\nChoose to treat your pain safely use physical therapy visit move forward P.

I don't think they've taken every dime true I yeah I mean\nDifficult to find more to spend a writer for ways to spend the first or millions remember the the classic documentary about from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance he would receive full and hair and it's a three hundred or um this is important moment in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any asset so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right here to zero at this at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing where you do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around so that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from then on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually and this is a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he a wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy of lottery [noise] uh so I think uh you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nCan they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we even may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a ...\nA democratic socialist and you have to spend sixty trillion dollars\nHarder than you think it is harder than you know they can you do it\n... the socialist already have but can you do it\nVery difficult right he's a very different ... over that I mean we're going back dot com slash tours yeah I'd like to go by the way to get [noise] grab your tickets\nBill O'Reilly is coming up in just a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I I don't know if you've seen this but uh Minnesota's democratic ...\nFormer ah or sorry farmer labor party\nAh this ah this this weekend to this last weekend said Republicans should be brought to the guillotine\nOn November So that's a that's okay that's that's a that's not as bad as saying you want a targeted districts to take her right right yeah yeah the guillotine is I mean you know that's common language people always say that ah bringing a gay a teen we get ... but those you know whoever into a gear team\nNow I assume mhm I hate to say this but I assume they're not actually building get changed but Republicans and I'm not sure I'm not a hundred I'm sure it any more I think I Do think that the FAA you know could be talked into it pretty quick all yeah\nAnd if I probably could be a Roger Williams the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they're saying ... or Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of congresspeople Maxine Waters harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil all these things are ... are are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie

smoke filled the cabin Fox's John decker live at the White House\nSense well we used to ... where they would miss and it was because they didn't spend enough money advertising for it\nSo it's I think there are questions there that that still need to be raised as far as hey this the stock price really expensively and then you know the other question they do have out there is you've got everyone in their grandmother starting up a streaming service now does that drive up content costs for them further\nIt it's definitely a competitive marketplace if you talk to people in that industry though they'd rather work for Netflix than they would Disney\nThey'd rather work for Netflix than they Woodfox they'd rather work for Netflix than virtually anybody else because they have more creative work ah [noise] what am I trying to tell the ... more latitude they they can more flexibility when they're working for Netflix than they would if they're working for ABC\nThat's one ABC's the biggest competitor I don't think ABC is anymore you know\nYou know you talk if you're talking about the type of Amazon's legit competitor wouldn't you say well I mean the biggest one no one took HBO\nYeah HBO is the big they they got forty million subscribers of their own in the United states like they are the biggest competitor out there no one likes to talk about it because you know the oh they're all gave them a year now AT and T. yeah 'cause Eighteen people over ... oh dear\nAnd they and they TNT is coming out with the streaming product the lord\nWe're going to be based around HBO ...\nI think you know there is competition out there and you know and I know that we always think hey you know ABC is completely different product that this right um the ones that are going to be threats are going to be places like Amazon like a you know Eighteen empty now that they have HBO under their umbrella um those are going to be threats\nAnyway that Amazon and Eighteen T could collaborate [noise] ah what what what are you thinking well you eat the the big issue is Amazon has this mode right now and they're spending what eight twelve billion dollars a year\nI'm saying like ATM fees product on Amazon or something like that when you think I don't know if Amazon would want to kind of ... their own offering and that way you get into the telecom business I I just I don't know if that's where they want to be going ...\nYou know we'll see see it it's fascinating though ... verse ... if we did a poll probably not what do you think Ninety percent of our listeners have watched a net flip our where\nThey don't ... it was lower remember when we asked how many people subscribe to Netflix\nWell yeah but that's a different different uh yeah like Tucker doesn't subscribe he's ... somebody else's no I have my own account thank you you didn't boil it still counts as a subscription whether you're my thought on ... only moved ... no no that's just Chuck\nNo my parents are moving off me how that's right yeah well I have five ... pay back the pay them back for college Fifteen bucks at the time yep\nUm anyway that the uh the Netflix story goes on and by the way if you own the shares their up Twenty one dollars today [noise]\nNot bad today for enough not today Mitch McConnell calls the rising budget deficit very disturbing\nHey you know there's there's a valid point here very when you have a bad economy if you if you're in a two thousand and eight and two thousand nine you should be running huge budget deficits right that that's when you run a\nTrillion dollar two trillion dollar budget deficit to try to get people back to work when you have a four percent GDP you should either have a budget surplus or darn near a balanced budget yeah\nTypically I don't really like the ... just because it means that you're taking in more tax revenue than you need are closer to a budget balance a balance but you could see that so if if you go and take a look in terms of you know where the money is actually being spent okay\nIf you're talking discretionary areas 'cause that's really what we're talking about right now unless we want to talk about Social Security\nWhich we could that's what Mitch McConnell wants to do right\nNow wants to go after Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and I got to tell you is if I'm a disinterested party if I'm an actuary just looking at it financially oh yeah I said that's where you have to go you have to well it's really literally it's a nightmare\nIt is in and here's why it is the biggest issue that you have to go after if you will get all the projections not so much today but going forward as to where our spending is going to be it is all going to be heading in that direction over the next Twenty years as we continue to age\nUm so you have to make adjustments to those programs just because they're not sustainable with the way they are set up today the system that was put in place you know originally Seventy years ago now it's simply is not up to date with how long Americans are living in the cost of medical care of because of the two things that really don't work\nSocial Security is pretty easy to fix to be honest there's not much you need to do in order to fix it ... you can play around the edges\nWe talk just increased the tax or ... you don't even ... so I can do this I there's a great website I every time we talked Social Security and bring it up there's a website from the committee for a responsible federal budget or called the Social Security reform you can go to yourself and by around\nUh I and it's a think tank I don't know who I I don't know you know what the case of actively but here's what you can do okay subject all wages to the payroll tax write that covers Seventy two percent of the deficit that Social Security has beyond that\nLimited spousal benefits for high earners okay so if you're in the top twenty five percent of earners you can limit spousal benefits how much does that cover a just four percent of animals\nOr if you calculate benefits based on the highest thirty eight years of earning instead of highest thirty five ... that covers an additional eleven percent uh and then the last one that I had there was one or two at least thirty eight years but they at least men are most most people tend to\nUm and so if you do all of that there's one other thing that I did I Can't find what it was but it wasn't cutting benefits or raising taxes for Ninety percent of people up and it covers one hundred percent of the shortfall okay their Social Security Medicare\nMedicare you can't fix where you just raise the tax rate racing raise the cost you ... you don't just raise the taxes you have to pretty close to double the knocks on Medicare ... that we raise for Medicare in order to cover\nIt we got to do something at some point right in the longer we wait the more painful it's going to be yeah and McConnell I thought you know I Am not a ... I don't care for McConnell necessarily but he is at least being on a saying hey we have to address these three per and who can't spend all this money on Medicaid every\nYear either well it it really is a question of how do you fix them if you simply go and cut all the benefits to make the programs work yeah you're gonna end up with an awful lot of unhappy people because now they don't have the benefits that were promised to them so you have to have some kind of compromise here you have to deal with the problems it's going to be some combination of raising taxes\nGroup [noise] yeah what what was particularly interesting to me here was the difference between the average balance in the median balance and you know that in perspective the average balance pretty much at all those numbers together as you know every four one K. and Iran together and says okay divide by the number that we have and that's what you get\nThe median looks at the person in the middle fifty percent who actually is right in the middle of the distribution\nIn every single age group the average was significantly higher than the median what do you attribute that to there's a ton of people on the top and that are doing a really good job saving money in most people are doing a great job actually what's the max you can save per year into a four one K. and\nIf you are below age fifty it's Eighteen thousand five hundred a year if you are over age fifty it's twenty four thousand five hundred a year you get a little bit of a a boost\nTo the ketchup provisions and Connecticut Company has been accused of over charging more than a hundred thousand Massachusetts residents for their electricity we're talking about that story when we return to the financial shape\n[laughter] like\nShow breaking news is always\nOn the financial exchange radio network\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nRun the W.

that were advertising and then they were being overcharged for electricity or if\n... like a bait and switch a scheme to me Chuck where your bill might go down for three months and then all of a sudden it went up quite a bit\nYeah and and they're saying that this costs are somewhere around two hundred and sixty dollars per residential account so it's about a thirty million dollar a settlement that effectively the state of Massachusetts is looking for on this one\nEverybody that got scammed it looks like on average about what two hundred and sixty bucks yeah\nSomewhere right in that range there so it's you know this kind of the first stage and trying to recoup this money\nIf you have a shot at getting it because apparently national grid is holding thirty million and and so I think they

S. and P. is down twenty points IBM contributing about Seventy five points to that doubt decline of three hundred and two will be back with another hour of the financial exchange right here on your favorite station very ... [laughter]\n\nWell duty AG men double duty ADHD Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nTurkey expands the search for answers and the resume and murder of a journalist I'm Dave Anthony Fox News secretary of state Pompeo has left turkey where he held talks the day after meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised\nBit uh we'll see you know we talked about rising interest rates one of the things that does impact\nIs your ability to buy a house and we ran through the six New England states and Florida in Connecticut Chuck the median home price has two hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars so to buy that house theoretically you're going to take a mortgage out of a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars\nAt four point nine percent which is where mortgage rates are today that monthly payment is a thousand and Thirteen dollars but if the rates go up and here's what the president's fear is the rate goes from four point nine to six that payment goes from a thousand Thirteen to one thousand one hundred and forty four dollars if the home is still ... the same with the\nWay I tend to look at it a lot of people\nAnd again people do this even though it's I don't usually recommend it ... they buy at the top of their price range they say hey the banks of that I could borrow three hundred that I'm In a bar or three hundred thousand\nWell if they're doing that and rates go up the banks gonna come back to them and say hey rates went up one percent we can't lend you three hundred grand anymore we can learn to two hundred and Seventy and so if that happens to enough people\nWent a sellers have to eventually say gee we can't get what we thought we were going to for the property and prices come down a little bit it makes it more sustainable I\nI think one of the biggest problems with low interest rates is that ... and it's not talked about a lot what say that you're saving ten percent of your money for home each year and you're making fifty thousand years you're saving five thousand a year five years from now you're going to have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved\nIf ... twenty five thousand\nIf rates go down there going to push the price of that property up which means that you're twenty five thousand represents a smaller percentage downpayment so it makes it more difficult for you to buy the place you want because we always borrow more alarming\nIs rates are going up and you still have the millennial generation that hasn't bought a house the vast majority of your peers still do not own a home\nWell if you live and mom and dad's house long enough eventually they're going to be gone and you're just upstairs you know all kidding aside those generationally there this is we've never seen anything like this heavily\nI I don't know about never I Would imagine during the great depression we met in the last four generations you know they're they're never see you got to go back to the twenties stuff you look at thirty year olds and their homeownership rates right haven't seen this before [noise]\nYou know you have a part of it though if you haven't and the the issue for me is that if you think the fed is going to continue to be easy money in the long run it's a problem because those thirty year olds are gonna get left out of the appreciation that eventually comes in those properties\nSo move as quick as you can because you see they I think what\nI think you can anticipate and this is something I Will note the correct answer for Twenty years but I Would suggest to you folks that inflation is going to run hotter than interest rates and I think the fed is okay with that\nAnd they kind of tell you communicated that you know they'll tell you that they want to see inflation running in that\nTwo percent range if it ran at three I don't think they'd worry about it I tend to\nI mean Jay Powell said as much I Know he said that in his last you know they said that he wanted to be you know a little bit more hawkish it sounded like and I know everyone panicked on that earlier this year he said look if we have to run a little bit harder to get to a long term average of two and a two percent inflation will let it run hotter\nIn Florida the median home price is two hundred and twenty four thousand dollars median mortgages a hundred and Seventy nine so Chuck in Florida if your mortgage rate went from four point nine six that would be nine hundred and fifty three dollars a month to a thousand Seventy seven dollars from a\nHundred and twenty bucks yeah so did ... rising rates are having an impact there's no doubt about it um but I Would make the case in the long run your building more stability and more normalcy back into the market\nI don't think it's a problem what do you make of this story though that Americans are starting to say gee renting is not so bad after all [noise] cheaper than owning and I'll tell you once you own you must be experiencing this you know living through your first year\nBeing home yes every weekend right there is money out the door and home repairs and projects\nAnd oh there's always stuff going on I got I'm doing a big bold plant this week and uh yeah I got a hundred and fifty bulbs then I'm going to be all around the ... the guy oh these are back on oh yeah it'll be a whole lot of fun I won't be able to move well but yeah so you you've got this uh this jumped now that Seventy percent of people now say that renting is more affordable than owning um\nWhich is not a great sign if you are someone who's looking to sell a place in the next couple of years 'cause you potentially last buyers that would have come into your you know kind of your orbit\nUm I think that's one of the things that is interesting on this is this is the very sentiment that could actually make homeownership more affordable in the long run because if people say look\nThese prices don't make sense and I don't want to be buying I'm not going to buy a ... going to look no those prices are going to eventually come down and you're going to be able to see people who say hey things have ... it's it's a pendulum swings back and forth as what he does not seeing dramatic increases in in ... you\nKnow and and and we got permits and housing starts this morning that were ... she'll continue slowing um you know the the building that's going on just is not at the level that we want to see it you know we're still round about twenty percent white as far as what we see in a healthy market probably\nComing up we're going to be talking about the largest in water boat show in the
