shall we say John monstrosity of a building that looks like\nYou know the ... every night mayor you could ever have about the way they build buildings in the seventies right\nWell they did this building was built for I think if memory serves Seventeen and a half million dollars back in Nineteen Seventy three yeah and uh oddly enough the original court house which is next door\nA cost a two hundred and forty four thousand dollars to build back in the Eighteen sixties they would probably take you that much money now to do the air quality study in the in the current building yeah it has it has never been respected it's a big block building yeah it it was\nIt was state of the art back in Nineteen Seventy three it has never been state of the yard after that\nThey've got all kinds of air

get I mean he's dead so I'm well here's here's the deal or the John I take exception with what you said I think that building would stay to the yard for about Fifteen minutes\nI Would say that it is now but it reminds me of a typical seventies buildings were stirs police department it's like the same guy designed both buildings let's have no windows let's have a lot of concrete\nLet's make it look like something out of Woody Allen sleeper which was a movie about the future\nBut that's about it they just just not a a pretty building an E. S. like you having spent a lot of time in there it's just awful it is no windows it's dark it's you know and contrast that with when you go into war stirs new courthouse Worcester county\nDistrict in superior court much nicer okay so but the reason we're bringing this up is that state officials are saying we're doing\nEnvironmental testing\nIn the building of the air now this comes on the heels\nOf a a really great guy a judge William boil and a John we both spoken fondly of judge boil a here nice guy\nHe has a retired because he\nHas a alas and and he's happy to hear that\nThe air quality in the building has been tested now how do we know that will Stephanie Barry from the Republican newspaper did a a request for a freedom of information request and she got a memo went out to hundreds of employees\nAnd saying hey we're going to um we're going to we're going to test the air quality and the building [noise] now bearing in mind that judge Robert Kumar he was a it was another great guy and I wasn't ... chief justice to John\nWhy how was\nAn eye opening experience we're going to show you all about it [noise]\nComing up in our number three sponsored this half hour is relief factor relief factor\nFor about four years has been an advertiser on a on the blaze\nAnd I have seen the people here are a few of the people who have real pain or take really factor I've always been a you know better living through pharmaceuticals guy\nLike I just you know hey have you tried which hazel no I don't know where I don't know what she makes no I haven't tried it all essence of orange is really going to know it's not no it's not\nSo I'm just I'm not a guy who was a into all that but when you have pain and you are so desperate that you'll try anything\nThat's when you can sometimes have an eye opening experience than I did with relief factor the back around Christmas uh my wife and I decided I was going to take for about three weeks and just see just see what do you have to lose\nWell how about your pain this has been transformative to me if you are in a constant pain or if you just have you know the common aches and pains this reduces inflammation it is for me\nThe next closest thing to a miracle one hundred per cent drug free created by doctors for key ingredients that help your body fight against inflation try it like I did for three weeks I'm Still taking it three times a day\nTry for three weeks it's Nineteen Ninety five Seventy for Seventy percent of the people who ordered the three week quake start or just like me Seventy percent order it over and over and over again\nPut your money where your mouth is that's a pretty big fact go to relieve factor dot com right now relief factor dot com [noise]\nDo you remember when you were dating and he used to do really special things then we're at the point where like our anniversary yes I knew that it was tomorrow trust one eight hundred flowers dot com\nThey have you've covered in right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses for only twenty nine Ninety nine one eight hundred flowers will give you another dozen plus a vase absolutely free one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon and typing the promo code back hurry the offer ends this Friday\nHi Michelle can hear the gods now movie opens on October twelfth scheme came in the entire cast was her job bringing this during the big screen\nHow the woman goes into a funny comes down and there's no police report you might be\nWorried about this movie too scary it's not the mother of two I promise you can bring your teenage children to bring friends and family we have a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion [noise] don't know how\n... perhaps the most ... in American history God's know rabies be G thirty\nPillows [noise] unit bank here with a learned the patient to my neighbors who likes to bank loans if recent changes to your bank ownership have you feeling less connected to your bank talked was\nRevenge him neighbor for almost a hundred and fifty years [noise] and we'd love to be a\nFive Seventy four to seven zero\nAbout making just with today\n... member FDIC member DAS\nThen Indiana hello Don welcome to the program [noise]\nBeen learning hey\nYou go ahead no go ahead sir\nYou wanted me to look at page new to Ninety four of the book addicted outrage what's what's your uh question\nOh no I'm just a study that I'm On a street I get for\nOh you are yeah yes okay and you're talking about a recovery steps alcoholism yeah\nAnd I'm trying to ... to the nation and where is the ... or ...

rates need to get before investors said heck\nWhy am I why am I investing in these companies at\nThe at the margin there's a little bit of a difference all the time but like your question is at what point do you crack when I go okay collectively let's get out of this stuff and let's go way to fix type stuff\nUh I think that number is in the four percent four and a half percent area and you people might laugh at that but you know what in Nineteen Ninety nine last time we had a robust rock and roll stock market that ended up becoming too expensive\nThe ten year treasury was six point two percent yeah OK up ... and people were not buying the guaranteed six point two they all want to know sucks threat we learned our lesson sure uh so the question now is in the real normal world what is that right probably another hundred basis points higher would be real competition for stocks\nSome more practical examples writer so I have a thirty year mortgage rate locked in at three point eight seven five percent\nOkay I'm very happy with that right when I have extra money I have a choice I can invest that extra money\nOr I can pay down by ... those are two of my options I could also go blow it on a National Guard but that's just not me [laughter]\nBut at three point seven five I Would rather invested in the stock market over ten year time horizon I Believe that the stock market's gonna beat out the cost of my mortgage I fight a five percent mortgage that'd be a much tougher conversation for me much more difficult a math equation\nAnd you know what the the the exercise you're doing right now is an explanation of what's going on right now with the stock market because well what you're talking about doing with your with your mortgage is what investors every day think about that incremental extra dollar they have to invest [noise]\nWhat do I get to safe what do I get for a risk right and in Nineteen Ninety nine they were all willing to take a risk at any cost and we learned the pain of doing that\nSure right now you're seeing you know the the the people are very nervous because they're worried that is one of those moments I don't think we're there yet though unless we had a really large quick increase you're going to still see twenty percent earnings get growth yep overwhelm these issues were talking about\nIt it's the story of a lot of different markets right you know people are worried about the real estate markets well it's slowing down that doesn't mean it's heading for a crash it just means that prices aren't continuing to grow at seven eight percent per year nationwide\nOr you know when I look at the stock market yeah I I I see some cracks when I look at the U.S economy has season cracks in the foundation but it doesn't mean that or you know suddenly you know suddenly publicly traded companies are just going to start losing money hand over foot it just means that\nWell maybe instead of earnings growth growing at twenty percent maybe it comes down to ten or Fifteen Years on\nAnd on top of that there there's another issue I mean you're talking about the overall market which absolutely true\nWith in the market what we've had and you can understand the complacency that happens if Amazon works in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand sixteen and two thousand Seventy investor just kind of get used to throwing their money at all the companies that worked as an investment now these are great businesses but what we're seeing happening right now\nIs a rather dramatic rotation\nOut of that which we just got used to buying any price ... and into a lot of the really good value that exist in the stock market in places like financials and places like some of these industrial southern overlooked\nUh we're seeing some of the out of favor stocks now doing really well and some of the real high flyers coming down to earth that's a healthy correction yep and we're not even there yet and we're not even there in terms of correction vigil socks we're seeing some go get hurt others combat that's a nice healthy thing when you get the expensive stuff kind of coming down\nThe inexpensive stuff going up that gets you to a more normal valuation yep so\nYes we have seen volatility yes than as act down almost four percent so far in October but still up twelve percent year to date so it you know we have to keep all of this\nAh in mind and consider the backdrop of what we're dealing with today ah right now by the looks of it uh in terms of the odds it looks like there's a forty one percent probability that the fed raises rates three or more times by the end of June of twenty Nineteen\nAnd that's the big concern going forward I mean look we'll that stopped the economy no no but uh it will take out some access and we can we talk about Pina there is no alternative that's a theme that you know very and I've been talking about for years\nUp there actually is a little bit of alternative and you can now get three percent next year if we have three increases you know you're gonna be taking a look at that mortgage regular look at that you know money market account and saying you know what\nI'm not going to be such a rush to put that money to work on my money market accounts them getting three percent right um that's a competitive return right so these ... and again this we should point out that that earnings are increasing at a twenty percent right there and that's very very healthy\nUm I don't want to be the dead horse on China here but let's talk about this meeting because at least from what I have seen a U.S relations with China while\nVery difficult and and privately we talk about how bad they are but I've never really recalled a public meeting between us and Chinese officials that was this fraught with contention\nYeah secretary of state Mike Pompeo exchange rather testy words with Chinese foreign minister and I thought he was I thought he pump a it was actually the ... one of the two when he was going crazy yeah I mean they're not happy and we we understand that\nA and this is complicating other issues in terms of international relations namely the anticipated summit with North Korea yeah\nSo I it's kind of a mess out there and politics is overriding this I mean they're watching our politics and we're watching their situation\nThat got to me that the north Korea issue to me is the only regrettable part\nOf our current policy towards China I pretty much agree with all of the\nMaybe not the cause of you know what we'd probably he said about the terrorists but the fact that we implemented these terrorists and are sticking to them right now I'm generally a big supporter of because of China's actions around or\nYou know stealing proprietary information you I'm the only piece that side impact that is regrettable to me is North Korea so unpredictable and we might have been close to wrapping something up there but that that might really take a hit because of these relations\nYeah I mean I at the same time you know we do have a good communication with the north Koreans and and really we can't trust them completely completely if you can't fight the war but you can't really buy these\nI think the cause of this quite frankly is you had a failing products so it probably wasn't attracting Google's top to exactly they want to learn and they didn't want to lose a little they have ... so I mean effectively you had this this basically a dorm or old project they probably didn't have Google's top talent working on it and it was just kind of ignored\nBut the bigger issue they had the day to leak that's a problem and they're going to have to address at the far bigger issue is that it was brought to the c._e._o. he met measured the risks and said you know what I Know we'll eat half a million people's information\nBut we're not going to disclose it they are conscious decision and that is going to bite them because it would ruin our reputation well guess what people have a right to know yup\nOr we're gonna take a quick break we're going to cover more of this story and we also have Wall Street watch coming right up here on the financial exchange radio

Schneider shatter ... Mr Shater a hoot\nWe've all seen he is papa John's yeah he is he's name is John he invented the company created it he owns thirty percent of the company but he got in trouble because I think it was on a on a a media call he made a third person reference to a um a bad word racial slur a racial slur\n... I I don't know if it was a media conference or an internal conference call but nonetheless he was ousted because of\nThat and that was the reason I I've heard that uh the culture papa Johns was was also part of it because I got to believe is more than him just saying I don't think it was Abraham Lincoln referred to so and so as being something that would make you lose your your business literally right out what's happening right now is to see who\nPartners up with John who has thirty percent of the stock\nAnd what happens so that's that's where we stand right now trying on his considered considering a takeover of papa Johns and there's other companies also that could be in the building\nYou know they only Wendy's they own dominoes at one point you know an arby's to I Believe uh this would make some sense that what they haven't dealt with I haven't seen try and dealing with a company in big\nPublic turmoil before you know they haven't they haven't address that issue of a papa John's type of scenario they haven't you know they haven't dealt with the company a lot of these companies you know CBS type of scenario where you're dealing with a CEO has been who has been in the spotlight\nAnd is very polarizing they dealt with you know issues within companies about sales and profits and things like that but not a big\nI Want to start a fight type of story because of the CEOs actions\nYou know and and this is the key point the key point is it's pizza and you can get decent pizza at a lot of different places or what differentiates you in that business is image an image alone leave that images tarnished\nYou're stuck with a piece of pizza that that anybody can get where ever they want a ... however they want and and the problem the question the sixty four thousand dollar question is how damage is that brand damaged John's\nThey had a pretty good at that I saw I think during the super during the football game on Sunday maybe ah with all the franchise owners a lawn they they just knew had clips of ten second clips of a bunch of different franchise owners or a papa John's right basically saying\nYou know that's not us still come to our store a ... a diverse group of people trying to really put that behind them because that's what's hurting it yeah it's hurting the stock papa John's but it's really hurting the franchise owners\nAnd here's the thing at the end of the day we talk about ... which is which is controversial\nBut you're totally has something kind of proprietary and they're going to have a lot of challenges no question about that but you know they can overcome it by saying we actually have different food we actually have a different presentation we actually have something you can't get out a whole lot of other places\nEvery town has like five pizza shops and so it's going to be a real challenge them but if they can come through this and they had the backing of a company that is really good at the food business and they're part of that chain you know it could work out\nAnd I mean papa Johns was the main reason that I put on Fifteen to twenty dollars so I mean I I'm a big supporter or they weren't around I was I wasn't even bigger supporter at one point you know twenty pounds bigger [laughter] what'd you could have been an equally twenty pounds bigger with pizza I could've\nOr does or dominoes I could've papa John's is the only one that was on the ah the college meal plan so that that was for me\nDominoes just delivered you know two thirty AM college and\nDid that many weekends yeah and nothing to be proud of mine is I Would take ... to ...

in terms of what we export but China did to slap tariffs on us Ellen gee\nYeah I'm ... that's got to be one of the main things you're thinking about if you are you're an investor in the you know typically the United states Ellen gee export business um that that could\nThat could certainly throw around ... ... you know I think about how many times are talking about individual stocks yeah and we say exactly that the impact that terrorists could be substantial or it might not it depends how this plays out\nThere's two things that I worry about what I'm Talking about buying any stock today what is Amazon going to do to it I don't think ... going to get on the L and G. space\nBut what is you know what are the China trade terrorists going to do to it and that ... that one could impact is stuck so interesting sector to be operating and I always ask myself what\nCan we do domestically how how how good is this business right here at home and if they're doing really well at home and they make their stuff here we don't have to worry about the ...\nWe don't yeah you know that may impact prices over all the remains to be seen that's it for this hour the financial exchange coming up on the next hour we're gonna be talking about the storm bearing down on Florida right now and uh get back a little bit into that Google story in the database that we saw stay tuned here the financial exchange [noise]\n\nHe is he's use radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG men double duty ADHD Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise] this is the Fox\nNews alerts the U.S ambassador to the un has resigned I'm Dave Anthony Nikki Haley takes a Washington by surprise but she isn't leaving immediately Haley's at the White House now telling the president who says she's done an incredible job boxers Rachel Sutherland live in D.C\nThe documents ... there's a quote from the wall Street Journal the document shows school officials felt that disclosure could have serious ramifications revealing the incident would likely result in us coming into the spotlight alongside or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed under the radar throughout the Cambridge analytical scandal [noise]\nThis is so much worse yeah this is so much worse than having been alongside Facebook during that issue\nAnd think about what they're saying is Facebook has got a lot of bad publicity\nLet's not get in the way that that publicity now let's just make sure all the bass and listen to this right under the rug is all Cambridge Analytica and all the issues Facebook has let's keep our problems quiet on top of the fact that the major technology companies were invited to Washington to discuss issues\nAnd I you know I I'm I defend the government they kept that seat empty\nGoogle nobody showed up now and they won't face the music and they have a lot of issues to deal with in terms of privacy and the way in which they regulate themselves it's basically a self regulation it's like a whole different world\nYeah it's not good chief executive officer a cinder ... almost definitely going to be testifying Congress now or that we are no doubt about it a subpoena time exotic they're they're lucky Europeans GDP the ... journal data protection regulation just went into effect in may whereas this incident took place in March\nOr that new law requires companies to notify regulators and breaches in than ... hours so if this law had been to placing Google would be facing a massive find from the European regulators as\nThere are kind of in a gray area now as to what's actually going to happen if there will be any fines for\nProbably they're going to be finds here I Will give the European regulators a lot of credit because they've been that is a good rule yeah it's a great role and they've been way out in front of the rest of the world when it comes to issues concerning Google al ... and ... what's the point of it you're disappointed the United states does not have a lot like this on the books it is\nOr the lack of regulation is really troublesome because uh there's millions and millions of people who are using these products they're following us everywhere we go they're listening to our conversations they know more about us than we think we know about ourselves on the other hand and and they and they operate independently and it's like don't bother us we're not accountable\nAnd and I know the argument the other hand as well if you don't like it don't sound on Facebook\nFair but there are some service that it's really difficult you know there's some online services is pretty difficult to not participate in produced it's tough to not have an email address these days yeah although there are ... yeah there are options though there are options that are more secure than yoga agreed but hey you still need to have data protection laws in place to protect us from\nIt's very difficult to have no on line a\nPersonality today to have no online presence whatsoever is very very difficult in this day and age it's hard not to be on Facebook\n... or ... especially if you're in business uh if you're if you're in business if you have a if you're trying to keep up with family down the main reason that I use it uh all of my ... my family and my wife's family is all on Facebook and wants pictures of my kids that's just a heck of a lot easier [laughter]\nWe've got great pictures of your kids and I can I can tell you that it's one of the highlights of Facebook at least on my ... the European general data protection regulation by the way al threatens penalties up to two percent of your world other companies worldwide revenue if they fail to adhere to these rules so I'm\nPretty stiff regulation that unfortunately was not in place when Google broke these rules\nAre so we will see what happens with school based on these results they're beginning to be held accountable that is good news and the good news if your Google investor on the other hand is\nFortunately this isn't all that Google does Oh absolutely now a Facebook that's all that Facebook does there a social media platform and they screwed it up\nGoogle is much more than a social media platform they screwed up their social media piece of it though ... absolutely and understand when it comes to search advertising\nGoogle has a gold mine they do I just hope it not

Seventy three percent of the survey respondents\nSaid they are reading tests behind the wheel fifty four percent said they're typing tax behind\nThe wheel I'm so certainly you know not a not a good habit um we also asked about other things like watching video doing drugs you know doing social media eight percent said they are watching Youtube videos behind the wheel but I thought that was pretty

think touch screens or a problem I really do yeah\nI Do I mean fortunately I'm not a big fan of new federal regulation but we've got federal regulation against driving under the influence of alcohol and the I think you need to have some sort of consistent minimal law around distracted driving but how do you prove it\nYou know a tough thing to remember\nRemember this do you do not have a right to drive\nYou have a right to do a whole lot of things you don't you don't have a right to drive eat as a privilege granted by the state so we can set what ever parameters we want to regulate that and we should now because we're talking about my life and your life not just the person driving around\nDistracted driving that person should not be on the road and has no right to be on the road\nAnd talk I have no idea how to regulate it no one does we we get out probably do get a ticket for these day down in ... as they're clearly you can at least prove that it happens but it's going to be much more

mentioned before the break John that uh there's a new tax credits being rolled out this year a and a lot a lot of things have changed with the tax code say we're gonna talk about this briefly but it's really important that if you\nIf you're not a hundred percent certain what's changing with the tax will sit down with a tax preparer if you do your taxes every year and this is going to be something new for you\nAnd I might recommend really talking with a tax expert at least understanding the new changes that are going into place here\nGreat advice because there are changes some some major changes a a real beneficiary here is a families with kids because the uh the tax cuts in JOBS Act that what's the name for the tax cut\nDoubles the maximum child credit from a thousand to two thousand dollars per qualifying child but what you referenced is a\nKids who are older than Seventeen who don't qualify as kids um who are going to school up to age twenty three and again we want to consult your tax advisor on this but you may be eligible for a tax credit a new tax credits of up to five hundred dollars for those defendants again we're talking about\nChildren in the household the normal children actually adults are up to age twenty three who are students\nRight so and you can take up to five hundred dollars just in specific rules you have to have her basically half of their cost of living\nAre so very specific rules around it and ... it's confusing to because at the same time that this child tax credit is going up\nYou also have the elimination of the what is it the individual or not the individual mandate the ... the individual deduction that you can take for each individual living in the house\nSo right and they're handing on agents were both so depending on the size of your family what state you live and whether or not you have a mortgage and how much other income you have you may be positively impacted by these changes you may be negatively impacted by these changes so\nIt's not simple it's confusing and ah it's it's new but at the\nBottom line is if you have someone twenty three or under yeah who is somewhat dependent on your income you might want to pay
