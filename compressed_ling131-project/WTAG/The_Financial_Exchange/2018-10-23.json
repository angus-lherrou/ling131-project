I think now because here's here's the reality and in a truck and I were talking about this excuse me I have to leave I'm going to go buy some stocks [laughter]\nI'll tell you why because I ... you know words sixteen point nine times forward earnings trucks has nowhere like Fort Fifteen I said no I checked a month ago we were at sixteen point nine now we're at Fifteen\nThat's assuming you get the correct but we're getting the the ease rioted even above ... expectations are so that number Israel that number is substantial and it Fifteen times earnings that's the average price to earnings ratio ... which means\nWe could have a major backup an interest rates and still justify these stock price yeah but the ... you could have a price to earnings ratio go to eleven what was it back in two thousand eight and nine\nBut we have growing earnings even by what we've talked about which is barest of the earnings will go eight or nine percent\nThat's environment that will be very supportive of a Fifteen multiple on stocks ... and it would allow us to go to four and a half percent among bond that's just my substantive fundamental\nRight you're on your and you are you're you're not a technical trader who are who are fundamental and you're not worry you so you would by today\nAnd not worry about it because you're holding the stocks for five years ten years absolutely what if you're the guy though\nThat's got to pay a tuition bill next August or being stocks or what what if that has to uh that that there has to ah you know pay a for a wedding you know the ... the I guess that what you're saying is that money ... your long term you're fine in the short term you a little nervous\nMy issue is I don't I never know the short term my theory is whatever you have to de ... that's created a little bit of wealth that's thanks to what you did five years ago as thanks so is it ten years ago what you do today influences your life five years ten years from now if you got tuition bills coming up next year\nI don't know any forecast is going to say you should be a stocks like ever because look bad markets can get worse right in the short term the market as a voting machine in the long term it's away machine mhm\nI not the lecture here but I I just feel like for a longer term money this actually is a rational entry points good and it's not a good time to sell if you have long through money that's just my God you're not selling today I'll take one one thing of doing it in terms of in terms of acid allocation if this turns into a panic\nThat forces money into bonds against in my opinion would be a dumb move to do to commit heavily at the bar right right but if it causes your bond that you'd like to get out of to go up in price right you might be able to pair off some of that and by some cheap stocks or leaving and the money market we're gonna are the same up\nTake any risk you heard it here first of all this is my opinion by John Mooney doing a lot to bring down my blood pressure you know there's this very appreciative you'll you should do is let's take a look at the yield on the ten year treasury\nOr the ten year treasury three Thirteen see none of the gun there you go now if that gets down around three and the VIX is only twenty three\nWhich is yeah your blood pressure is like around one forty seven right now [laughter] I Know I I look I'm not ... but as far as I remember the victims remember back in the in in in twenty seven twenty twenty ... twenty ...\nSeven and a twenty ...

I don't know the catcher in a guy you know\nI I Will say this that if the red Sox would win this and five this would be a season that is the standard against which all past and future\nRed Sox teams are judged if you win a hundred and ... and the regular season right you beat a hundred when team in for that was a record right a hundred and eight hours before the red Sox oh not not a an order out okay but they they beat a hundred one team in the first round they beat a hundred and three when team defending world champion a second round\n... this is something that we've not ever seen here and the ratings should be through the roof too by the way yeah Boston in LA imagine if it had not ... baseball measures that have been I Know yeah it would've been invented\nAnd nobody got their wash unemployment looks like two thousand again that's the New York times headline but wage growth does not and if you watched any of the ah listen to Warren Jeffs deal debate she brings up repeatedly you know this again is\nIs a glass half full or glass half empty story or the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been you know ... when you look at the rate it's as good as ever been it's fallen steadily over the last nine years is down to three point seven percent\nBut the other issue is wage growth hasn't been that great you know Barry we've talked about this ad ... I'd rather interesting analysis and and this I think resonates\nPart of the problem is for younger people\nSomeone like my son took himself out of the workforce because the outlook is so good he's doing it to advance his education they were married for just school so we talk we look at twenty five and twenty eight year olds a lotta times when that unemployment rate goes up it's because they're confident enough to go back to school\nThe older unemployment rate say fifty five plus when that gets worse it's because a lot of people are comfortable and rich enough to retire now the ... the demographic to watch and this raises some red flags the one most\nThat's like v they called the premise of prime age twenty five fifty four thirty ... more specific thirty five to forty for\nThose people are the prime of the crime in terms of working\nTheir unemployment rate is actually two points worse than the ... the best record of all time and there is an unbelievable number of people who

we always bring up with any stock is just how vulnerable is this to say deteriorating relations with China or increased terrorists is this the kind of company that will be hurt by that helped by that or or little impact\nOn a global recession that caused by increase Tatar decreased trade what effect it decreed that demand for products um so you know we all carry it on a global world man a company

particularly uh some of the book and chemical as like you know a lot like the F ... could look to climate\nParticularly if they want more of an American presence\nIn in terms of the macro and I kind of alluded to this earlier I Wonder if the recent weakness in the stock maybe flagging possible weakness that people are sniffing out in the global economy or just the economy at large I think that's a big factor in the reason why the stock has been weak\nOn yeah that definitely a factor you know we're looking at a economies around the world that have been a little weak or you know China and Europe\nThe U.S economy is still doing very well on a scale or that that can aging from around the world and read the U.S\nAnd it hasn't yet happened but um you know hopefully some of these trade

economy sensitive companies oftentimes can be a barometer of economic health they're both doing poorly and they're really dragging the Dow down in their systemic we would say economic helped\nMeaning they keep those companies aren't doing well a lot of other companies aren't going to do well they make a lot of stuff to build a lot of stuff and uh yeah there's and there's a lot of companies tied to

probably people are saying gee I should buy buyer now the problem they have is these verdicts are very difficult to overturn yeah because it's an a judge it because what buyer might do is they might say okay well let's appealed us you know what that judge went to college with the first judge right off and it's a\nJury verdict when you get jury verdict so I've been on these juries you don't want to be the company well because the the jury's relate to the victims and if the victims are real people ordinary people up against big round up fertilizer get it's like they said well we might not be

lawyers were innocent victim here has so much pain and suffering his lawn is not green but\nAt any rate let's move on I ... in a win for the president\nAngela Merkel has changed course on us gas imports this was a big deal six months ago or the president just said hey you know what you're buying your natural gas from Russia your hands on the dollar relative to what we can say they they can get it cheaper from Russia for by what twenty percent\n... exactly and that's why this is a case where the president taking his case directly to another leader has clearly paid off I mean when he uses the bully pulpit boat bully pulpit to advance our causes to help our products to help our exports are that to me is a very good thing\nFor the ... and that's what happened here I'd like to think about this because logical you'd say well gee Russia doesn't have to put it on a it Russia pumps the gas and then they simply put it in a pipeline and they sent it to Germany so obviously their costs are quite a bit lower than ours because we have to\nPump the gas and a pipeline we have to freeze it and we have to put her on a boat and then we have to ship it and then we have to I thought and then put it in another pipelines are costs are considerably higher than those of Russia but the problem is\nRussia is corrupt if you look at what I did that you we don't know if you remember this but\nSeveral years ago Russia just said to Ukraine who is misbehaving right\nWe're not going to we're going to turn the heat off in January and they did yeah these are not nice people and they could do the same thing to Germany and we defend Germany you're right we spend hundreds of millions of dollars defending Germany and Angela Merkel say well we want to buy it from Russia because it's cheaper well fine you want to do do business with\nHow much longer do you think it's going to be cheap as soon as you stop buying it from the U.S your prices going to go up from Russia\nAnd not to mention the fact that we are an ally and they are from right exactly there if not an enemy certainly a potential enemy and and this is a case where you know the president did talk about\nEurope need to come around and be a better friend and give us a little bit more of an advantage for all we do and I think this is directly tied to the president's personal lobbying efforts to get your up in Germany in particular\nTo be friendlier to the United states and to give us more of their business and he intensely lobby Europe\nTo by significant amounts of el ingenious part of that as opposed to Russia who killed more German most\nThan any other country in Germany has killed more Russians than any other country this is a case where I think the president was right I think is right now I make the case and and he had the total law on his side it's good for Germany to absolutely because they're not beholden to Russia rough [laughter]\nIt's like being beholden to the mob right\nYou don't want to open ... anything no no
