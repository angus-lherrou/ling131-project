I thought that was going to be the end of the lockout I thought for sure these guys would be back to work today what national grid hold a toll on the line\nIt's been four months now since this lockout started back in June and you know you're getting into the guy I got to be run out of money while in and you're getting into the time where this matters to be honest you know it's it's it's one thing where hey it's the summer and you know you you've got to deal with this and that you're getting into it it's\nOld out now that the company is the the company does not seem to be\nBending they know the company is holding the two big issues if you're not familiar with it you got about twelve hundred steel workers for national grid that have been locked out since June\nAnd the issues are the company wants to eliminate the defined benefit pension plan and they want to pass on more the healthcare costs to the workers and the workers are saying no where union and and we're we're we're we want that pension and you know we were going to stick to our guns\nIn the it's it's amazing that it has gone on this law in my opinion I Wonder what winter does to the ... the company saying hey we're still getting worked out we're not getting as much as we want to get done and they acknowledge it's costing them more than it would with the the union writers\nAnd and what what what I'm curious about this is you know if if the company you know just keep kind of going along as this eventually those additional costs I Do think will come down because of the big thing that you're losing with a lot of these workers not working today it's experience but if you have other workers that are building experience year after year and so for\nHim and where are they going to get the workers I mean these are ... are trained steel workers yeah\nAnd again it's it's it's not going to be a quick and easy resolution that's just something that look if if they decide hey we're just not moving ahead with this it might take three to four years for that cost to come down I kept\nThinking winter was the thing the emphasis is is it might be wrong on that is in its emphasis ... this is the fact that\nIt's getting cold all of a sudden because now it's going to happen is these guys are going to be out there trying to fix heating that's that's broken and and when pipes go down I mean these guys to go out and fix something in Seventy two hours\nI Would think that the again if it was thirty five degrees last night you know it wasn't warm like you're at the point where stuff starts getting used to ... I think in January February even before then cold you know it starts to ramp up and so\nMy guess as to what ends up happening here is I think the unions are going to lose on the pension plan do just 'cause I\nI don't think that like you every company is getting rid of them I think they lose on that I think they get some concessions on healthcare\nBut they so far it may vary according to the union they'd made very little progress they are they they've had a dozen meetings and they'd been cordial but it but in a virus\nYeah it'll part is doesn't seem like they're getting anywhere so we'll see if they can get a deal but again yeah go ahead for months a paycheck eventually some of these guys have to be getting\nIt must have this odd jobs you know they're skilled workers so they could be maybe they're doing side jobs with some guy could maybe they're working on that Columbia gas pipeline\nWell in part of it you almost wonder if you know obviously you know their their union workers you wonder if some other ... gigs or have you know having them some work saying hey you know we know you're in a tough situation where we can help you out\nWe'll see we'll see I voted early today because I'm going to be out of town on election day but it sounds like early turnout is rampant across the country\nYeah the numbers are pretty staggering I'm going to be a voting later today actually why are you doing it early just 'cause I don't want to wait in lines on voting day there's you have lines yeah I'd I'd just I don't want a chance to you know I've never voted where I Am right now I only moved a year ago the suburbs you don't have lines to say no that's that's good to know I just want to get it done then\nBut yeah you're you're seeing a early voting turnout in some cases in particular Indiana you up early voting turnout almost identical to presidential election year levels in midterms are normally you know significantly more quiet as far as the overall numbers that you see there\nDo we know whether one side is more fired up and the other is you know you get more Republican showing up more Democrats showing up to vote early and does it matter like does it cause usually you only get about a quarter of the eligible voters that voting bitter\nYeah and it depends on the state and it depends on the count you know it's like yeah there there's different trends depending on exactly where you go so\nI don't know if you can glean any you know results from this as far as oh early turnout stuff that is good for group acts it really depends on the specific race non specific candidates that are out there in a lot of cases what does the polling indicate\nRight now in terms of outcome if we're talking most likely outcomes out there you're\nMost likely outcome is that you see the house they were or I'm Sorry the house go Democrat and you see the ... they are even really unclear and here's here's why it's so unclear is that if you look at one of the best predictors of how things are going to end up playing out it's what we call the generic ballot which is\nHey water voters preferences just for Republicans or Democrats\nAnd a two or three points swing either way from where the polling is\nHas a massive effect is based on kind of how things are set up right now so if you see things end up two or three percent more Republican you could have Republicans keep the house and the Senate pretty easily actually if it goes two or three percent more Democrat ... winning a wave in the house and might even pick up a Senate seat which is a case where you\nDon't take you don't see the Dems taking the Senate in under any circumstance\nIt's ... there's maybe a five to ten percent chance that I think they do but I think it's really really unlikely usually ... saying it's one out of seven I'd say it's lower than not smart though so that kind of know what they're doing\nOur poll question today is do you vote early I did vote early and I participated in the poll you can participate in the bull by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com below it early I'd be curious if the end results are that you have higher turnout I I don't\nKnow the answer is do we 'cause it's usually about a quarter of eligible voters registered voters that vote so in the presidential election I think it's about half\nRight I'm pulling the numbers all I Need to dig out you get into that on one of\nThe next segment which is regarding a new drug for the flu it's flu season folks there's a new drug available for the first time in gosh twenty year I've\nNumbers actually if we

of the relevant period we've been anywhere on the low end in Nineteen Ninety six fifty one point seven percent\nOn the high end two thousand eight sixty one point six percent so generally around fifty five percent if we look at mid term elections going back to let's call it Ninety\nYeah we'll go back then as ... as well uh we're anywhere between thirty five and forty two percent to about thirty

I still am not convinced that were out of correction ... I think that we're going to continue to feel some pain\nOr possibly right up till Christmas maybe beyond but uh I I just don't feel that the markets are convinced that the worst is behind a Sega they want to go over\nWell I I tend to agree and I was talking to someone yesterday and and the point that we raised in that conversation so historically if you look at market correction is defined as being a ten percent more or more drop in markets you see one of those on average every sixteen Seventeen months there really comment you see those alive\nThe question is ... and the question that people have is look is this heading towards a barrel mark and defined as a correction or a dip of twenty percent more and more okay in the case that I made us look market corrections they're effectively ... they are test of the market to see whether or not the economy is strong enough to support current stock prices they're normal you'll see 'em a lot\nBetter markets occur when the economy is not strong enough to support market valuations it's when those tests failed ... that's what you get when those market corrections when those tests fail there\nIn this case when you look at it the one that we had earlier this year it was again it was a ten percent correction it was a test and the data came back over the next few months and they said\nHey we're still seeing an acceleration in gross yeah we're seeing wage growth inflation's tame everything looks good to go okay fine continue on on your merry way\nIn this case the data the next three months is going to be critical does it show a further V. celebration in housing do autos continue to roll over if the answer to those questions is yes and then you do have further room to go here so\n... it's going to be really interesting because the trained on that data suggests the answer will be no\nLet's talk about how we got data out from the national association of realtors as it relates to pending home sales yesterday we saw new home sales numbers that were very disappointing a housing seems to be weakening despite the fact that there's a tremendous amount of demand\nYeah in in in housing I I think it is not not even seems to be it is weakening and specifically last month for the first time in a while you still on increasing inventories any decrease in sales and ... that's not a good recipe for healthy housing\nMarket no but I mean the increased inventory level is nowhere near where you'd like to see it like you'd like to we like to have somewhere I don't know Tucker would like to see Eighteen months of inventory available because that means prices were low but six months is healthy and I still what do we have three four months\nOr ... I I saw a chart on this yesterday I'm trying to find where it is a year ago yeah uh oh no this is just for a new home sales started not existing so I have no help there but here's here's what we're seeing a new home sales to put this in perspective\nEarlier this year really late last year when things were peaking ... we had about five and a half months to a new home inventory that was available new home not existing but I'm ... now okay today a new home inventory\nWe're up to seven point two months and that's tough for the builders you know so that because they're building these things on spec often it is in the last time that we saw numbers at that level in terms of the number of a month's supply of new homes not looking at existing but a new homes which again or a small part of the market but it's where you get a lot of activity\nFor jobs the last time we saw numbers like that was two thousand\nTens C. my observation is that the when I drive around and I see the new homes that are being built there these big mansion silly long one ... they're they're building ... they're buying these two acre lots and they're building these houses that are I don't know five and seven thousand square foot house was\nBuying them but there was the only ones that are profitable for them to make if you could actually have self you could actually sell them and so I I look at it and that number is a little spooky and by the way that number in terms of months of ah inventory for new home sales that number is increased each of the last six months\nOkay so we're building the wrong types of homes and there's an excess of new homes but when you look at existing homes in total real estate for sale is still under a healthy level you still have a lot of pent up demand most millennials still do not own a home\nNo and and it's because it it\nIt and they're in their prime age like a millennial even a young millennial now it's like Twenty one twenty two years old I\nTook her where's

let's see here between Ninety excuse me eighty one in Ninety six are considered millennials you know so millennials twenty to twenty or thirty seven\nTwenty to thirty seven so yeah you you still have even you know for younger millennials in that twenty four twenty five range you know they're still not buying at the rate that historically they have leaving the old ones aren't like a thirty thirty five years or ... or not they're not in in its affordability you know that that is the key driver here it's a forty if\nIf Tucker could have found a home that he liked it but he wanted he would have bought ...\nYou know but I get the issue that Tucker's running into is the homes that he wants to either too expensive or other people are coming in a bidding up the homes that he wants to make them too\nExpensive it's just a matter of the you you've got a market that is not in balance right now it's got to change over time\nIt does what what concerns me is the things that prevent builders from building those smaller homes and those are going away right you know that increased regulatory costs than they used to labor like those things aren't going away anytime soon so I've got concerns that the smaller homes that people want to buy ...\nJohnson joins us now from New York you know our weekly soccer begin next year the founder and author of bull's eye brief actionable ideas for thoughtful investors [noise]\nAdam heck of a week to happier how's it going\nYou know I'm not a week ago I said I think on the book and I want I Want to let you know I Am on my back hurt\nSo what is it is not been fun I I Am not bullish at the moment and and I want to talk a little bit about why that is to see if I can get a response from in my view is it any time you get a market correction is a test of whether or not the economy is strong enough to maintain valuations\nWe saw one back in early earlier this year the economy over the next few months answered that bell and said yep we are strong enough and the market continue to move up words in this case we're seeing some pretty important data declining housing in autos\nAnd I don't think there's a chance to those turnaround in the next few months so I think we're closer to a bear market than a recovery here what are your thoughts on that\nThere was an additional component that I think we need to address and it's called valuation and actually get sick with what your guest mentioned housing auto because uh we just got earnings yesterday report and believe it or not a little bored at trading down you know I'm a collar on\nA beat the earning ... ... ... it reiterated the fourth quarter\nYou know what sometimes just reiterating\nThat you are in fact going to make what they said you know what you said you were going to make a good doctor you know eight or nine ... acquainted white ... better if you take a company like afford down for now you will find value buying it thinking just stabilize that ethic\nBored with trading yesterday on the low\nAt about ... times already think of that and by the way ...\nEight and a half percent [noise] no it ... the year\n... and also one other point there when we factor in the earnings rose and this is a point you know for the bulls that that you do after that I have to acknowledge here\nIf you factor in the earnings growth that we've seen this year even with the market being equivalent to where it was at the start of the year we are way cheaper on a relative basis than we were ten months ago so there is you know some comfort saying look valuations are stretched in general but that doesn't mean they're necessarily stable here\nYeah well I mean I think you and I are ultimately trying to find some sort of common ground even though you call yourself a barren I call myself a bowl and here's why um because\nWe as you just pointed out if you take something out far enough it becomes cheap right and the ... been trading at fourteen and a half times dirty\nBut well I Will grant you on the fact that GDP coming out tomorrow at three point three percent is lower than it was last quarter which was for way too um I Will counter by saying yes\nBut look at worst Dr price and there there comes a point at which you sort of rebalance you'd say well OK growth has slowed a little bit but you know what ... come down so much that\nI'm willing to actually step in and buy and I think that's what we're starting to see today you've taken ducked down far enough that people are starting to say All right this valuation I'll actually step in and buy\nAnd I'm looking at valuations what in particular seems most attractive to you when we're talking either sectors are individual names what seems attractive to you in this environment where it seems to me companies that are pure gross oriented and don't have\nMuch in the way a cash for profits are being punished where's more stable companies are being rewarded a little bit\nYeah I I agree on that front certainly on on the growth you grow the names that hard if they don't have a you know earnings but look at financial um you know look at bank of America a Goldman Sachs Blackstone\nI mean these companies all three of them actually now a trading under ten times during each right on in the case of some of the banks there they're trading back or you know one point two Times Book value I mean that the you know compelling um you look at some of the industrial I Know\nAdam Adam stop at the banks why are the banks are discounted\nBecause here's my cake and and\nI liked the bank okay but might take is that uh\nUh too many people are assuming right now that the economy has hit its peak and that we're going down from here on that probably the second quarter was as good as it got and if\nThe economy it was as good as it gets that means that can only get worse and more consumers and bank or at least single most leopard group consumers and that's the auto loan on housing et cetera on student loans or\nIf if the consumer is going down to Mexico\nI financial ... had been getting rinsed for the last thirty days or should they stay in by more what ... what do you do\nI have been buying more have it and it it's been a painful right in fact my my single worst performer right now\nIs a a company called bank of the Ozarks ... they actually renamed it ... it's been the poster child for construction for betting on construction in in this country stocked up about twenty five percent in a week and a half\nUm because uh people are are are assuming that that the whole thing is the house of cards and coming out
