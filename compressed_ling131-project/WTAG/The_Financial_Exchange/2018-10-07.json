I Know you had illusions right there but some of the things that people really should be looking for that should not be included in their trust one of the things you've included here is trigger language can you explain what you mean by that yeah\nIt it's usually goes with trigger or termination language you can kind of couple of those two together so if you have language in there that says in grants any kind of discretion\nFor the distribution of principle but limits the exercise of the discretion saying that it can't be exercised if in fact you know it's needed for nursing home or for payment of medical expenses and things like that\nThat would be a problem that would actually cause and there's a a a Cohen case in a cancer case out there that say hey language like that discretionary limiting language needs to be disregarded okay you can't limit\nThat so what do we do\nWe just prohibited right there is no ever know discretionary language in our trust that says principal can come out\nTo to do nor mhm under any circumstances hey so don't put discretionary language around it and don't give the right to terminate I kind of tied the two together that's kind of a trigger don't give the right of the trustee to terminate\nThe trust and distribute out all the assets to to uh beneficiary because\nTerminated on on what grounds\nThey might think it's too big to manage too small to manage is not becoming economically efficient to manage\nThose language that language exists for our revoke ... trust but not for are irrevocably medicate trust so know termination clause should be in your trust either\nAnd you know you talk about having that language in there about kind of under different circumstances having that money come out of the trust what about the flipside of that where you have one of your problematic provisions is silence as to the distribution of principle why would that be a problem\nAnd you know that that's probably ... and and this is not only one of the biggest problems of drafting these trust but the easiest problem to spot especially if you're a lay person\nLook at your document there's going to be a paragraph that says during the life of a creator the donor big bold usually in the middle right underneath that section you'll find a paragraph that explains what can be done\nAnd there should be a paragraph granting the distribution of income\nTo you don't or but right after that you must see a paragraph that prohibits the distribution of principle under any circumstance to the don't or it cannot come out\nThat being said if that is not there that one little paragraph is not there mhm and it just says income can come out and then the next sentence is\nUpon the death of the donor or mhm which means they completely ignored right paragraph just just left it off\nYou're going to lose on that case wow they're going to say if you go to a a fair hearing or even perhaps superior court I don't know but if you go to a fair hearing they're going to say under the uniform a trust code\nThere are such broad trust the powers that if in fact there is not a prohibition on the distribution of principle or the prohibition on anything any one item then you can do it\nSo if it's not prohibited you can do it and therefore it's going to be at risk for the nursing home to make sure that paragraph isn't there\nWhile so got to be really careful with that folks there so much you need to be kept for foreign there's there is a couple of yet ... five other six other no wait there's more but wait there's more there's a lot of problem\nTrust provisions that tie and he was looted and you know yeah there is an awful lot of issues that you want to avoid ... you don't want to be saying okay my husband's in the nursing home my wife's in the nursing home but we're good we had this try and find out right oh well your trust is silent as the principal and I think it's the way they lay it out in\nThere will be easy for you and you know you simply read the bad paragraph and read the explanation as to why it's bad and you can yeah try to do it in English for you so you can understand it and\nAnd I try and hands late lawyer to English for you folks doesn't always work on the air [laughter] I Try well you know what\nYou did not go to law school folks but fortunately for all of Utah did he is our subject matter expert when do

everything that included in the big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan Bowers\nComeback Todd have a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Bob in Hyannis math\nAnd Bob rights can I buy my mother's house from her at a discount and let her live their rent free for the rest of her life in exchange for that discount she's having a hard time keeping up with the mortgage payments and I'm In a position to help her out\nThe sale would leave her with around a hundred thousand and proceeds after she pays off the mortgage if she ended up going into a nursing home would this be an issue with Medicaid if she sells it to me at a discount even if it is in exchange for a living rent free love people being creative whole isn't on mine had a loophole liquor\nIs an interesting created position or creative position to take 'em what's analyze and yeah I Can't just answer it was out a little analysis huh\nSo first what are we doing whatever you anybody out there wants to sell property\nBelow fair market value which is what they're doing here\nYou are technically running into something that is called a part sale part gift okay and the IRS will knowledge it as a part sale part gift so arguably if I sell a piece of property that's worth five hundred thousand for\nFour hundred thousand I've made a one hundred thousand dollar gift mhm and a four hundred thousand dollar sale okay so what does that mean to the Sadler\nTechnically you should file a gift tax return and acknowledge your gift of one hundred thousand dollars mhm won't result in a capital gains oh I'm Sorry it won't result in a\nTaxable gift because you will simply eat into your eleven million currently eleven million one hundred and eighty thousand dollar federal gift tax exemption mhm by the hundred grand\nForget the president interest exclusion let's just say by the hundred grant okay no tax for the ... for the giver right\nAnd no tax in Massachusetts because there's no gift tax and there's no gift tax in any state if you are listening except Connecticut\nSo ... I don't know if you're in Connecticut All right so I I get it that's a good deal shoes me a good call\nWhat's happening on the Medicaid front ... that that was the gift tax front on the Medicaid front\nWe have this problem a five year weight has just been created\nBecause it's a disqualifying transfer at least as to the part that would be considered a gift in other words something you gave away and did not get fair market value in return for the piece that wasn't fair market value would be I Would think would be considered a gift and you have a five year waiting period for Medicaid\nYeah which ability in case a mom\nGot sick after this transaction yet even though she's living there okay I get all that so do I still want to do it maybe it's okay\nI Would say no because I never ever want to give assets to children one I'm living\nNothing good can come from that mhm so those are the first two problems next I don't own any more\nSon can kick me out anytime you want I can sell it I don't get the proceeds are exposed to my son's creditors who could have a divorce and I could lose my house through to their divorce\nOn and on and on and tax problems so nothing good comes from that one other problem I see if I successfully given it away arguably I've lost the ability to get a step up and basis on the property especially here where\nYou're doing is sort of in exchange for the ability to live there\nI Know there's this case out there called the state of Gwen that allows people who give away assets to continue to enjoy what they give away yet causes it to be included in their state\nTo preserve the step up and basis so at least I think Bob you'll probably be able to avail yourself of that case\nAnd if you sell the property after mom dies you might not have a capital gains tax problem [noise]\nBut you know what there's so many other problems here that I wouldn't do this ...\nI Would say Bob you can be in the very same place while protecting Mumbai having mom put it in this trust that we talk about here designing this trust\nPut it in still a five year waiting period mom can live their moms in charge no risk of being kicked out mom can sell the property mom can avail herself the capital gains tax exclusions and you're going to get a full step up and basis when mom passes\nAll the while the property protected from the nursing home mhm why would I give it away right\nThere is no benefit in doing that Bob or anybody listening\nYeah and you know what folks if you've been thinking about doing planning to protect those assets get your clock started\nEven if you do get your clock started made sure it started with the right type of document and make sure that that ... trust is drafted properly\nTaught is written a brand new guide for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust and we know the status scrutinizing these applications that go in folk so you need to make sure\nYou have a solid state plan that is drafted properly his guide will show you the language that must be included in your trust as well as\nAll of the problematic provisions that absolutely must not be included in your trust\nCall right now to request year pre copy of Todd's designing your ... trust guide brand new eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine you can also download a free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com [noise]\nTaught our last question comes from Michael in deadly mass in Michael writes\nI live with my father in a home that we both purchased fifty fifty years ago and we are both on them that we are both on the mortgage is my father allowed to pay off the home mortgage as a way to spend down his assets so he can qualify for Medicaid down the road he\nIs healthy now but is this a possibility\nSo again let's put a little analysis of this so that everybody can benefit from it\nWhen we talk about applying for Medicaid mhm and that's what Michael's worried about here whether it's now or down the road and that's important when I say whether it's now are down the road because some of you listening might be faced with a nursing home situation right now mhm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Worcester", "day": "07"}
