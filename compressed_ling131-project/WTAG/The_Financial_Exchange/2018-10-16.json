because that's the gravity that can kind of keep prices from going to want higher\nSo I Want to keep an eye on that two and a lotta\nGiven go here you know uh in the next next year\nKnown as for its lobsters and light houses Maine also has one of the oldest populations in the United states the median age in the state of Maine John his forty three ... around five years older than the rest of the country to attract younger workers\nMain is providing tax credits to student loan borrowers what a brilliant strategy I think it's absolutely brilliant and you know we say that\n... and states and governments need to take a page from private enterprise and find out what it is people do in the real world to attract people and keep people and get people to come work for you\nOne of the things we hear private enterprise is people want to have help with their student loans and you know me\nIs offering student loan help to people who live in Maine and work in the state\nAnd I just think it's a great idea because they\nThe population is getting older now people are moving out there they're trying to encourage smart people to stay in you you go to vote in college you go to ... stay here you go to ... stay here and and we'll pay your student loans for the way the program works if you're not familiar with it\nIs it's a tax credit program\nSo if you're paying two hundred dollars a month in student loans at the end of the year when you file your tax return your state tax return has pretty high income taxes\nYou're going to get a tax credit huh equal to the amount of those student loans up to two hundred bucks more if you're a stem major like if you're a science technology major you can get more but that's that's a like most kids when they graduate college are going to have student loan payments\nYou know the kids I Know if you've got forty thousand dollars and your student loan payment on that might be anywhere from two to three hundred three hundred and fifty bucks a month so far the sudden state of means pain that for you and you you get a job offer in Portland yet right you know say hey Portland nice city\nGood place to live maybe a nice place to raise a family and if nothing else they're going to pay my student loans\nAnd think about what that means for Portland for or from Maine I mean if that person making eighty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars you look at that state tax next year year after year after that you'll get the fact that you're probably going to own a home and we pay property taxes are going to help your community a at a time when they're losing people it makes a lot of economic sense and we talk about the fact that private employers\nAre now offering is sometimes in lieu of four one K. matches or in addition to four one K. matches\nThis type of program to help students with their debt and we're seeing survey after survey of\nPeople coming out of college saying they're number\nOne worry is paying that low enough to think about it right you you graduate from a Wentworth you graduate from northeastern Yale whatever your ... and if you have an opportunity to go work for a biotech company in Cambridge and they're going to say to you or will pay the first three hundred dollars a month later student loans\nShe was that's hard to turn down and it's a smart move on their part to do that so\nYou know kudos to Maine for doing this uh sometimes you know\nA necessity is the mother of invention and a lot of times when you're pushed to the back to the wall you do the things you probably need to do and you come up with creative ways to get by and you know main is dealing with a crisis like you said the average age the median age being forty three uh\nThat is not good news because that means people who are younger are leaving this will help yeah absolutely nothing big impact it you know the problem is\nWe report on it today won't have an impact for ten Fifteen Years true but it it does send a powerful message though if I'm you know a a college kid or or even high school kids in Maine\nAnd I'm thinking about do I want to settle down and work in the financial industry in Portland where there's plenty of find places to work or to want to relocate and go to Boston I tell you what Rhode Island should be doing something like yeah yesterday ... road I this is something yeah great schools down there yeah and

us\nYou're welcome thanks for having me\nJennifer human Armstrong is interesting has a huge yield and performing very nicely the last five years what is it exactly they do\n[noise] um they invest in um what they called pro climatic assets that have ... positive greenhouse gas profile meeting\nClinic cleaner energy infrastructure as well as um like water conservation infrastructure can also be energy efficiency\nProjects um renewables like solar and wind um so it's a it's a large variety of asset assets related to clean energy and better use of resources\nAs it relates to climate change and

and and\nAlso offer services to the top engineering companies and the world so they have deep and long relationships with these various engineering firms\nAnd that is kind of like like a cornerstone of their business so it's a reliable pipeline of projects that are high quality um\nBut yet the the the stock itself is a huge dividend yield uh more than double the market it to me that's often times of red flag what is the risk that the markets sees in this investment that uh maybe others might not see\n'em you know I think the stock went down like a year ago and in the last year and a half because of the changing interest rate environment and I think I'm the market has had a hard time classifying exactly what had an Armstrong does some\nUm put it in the commercial mortgage rate bucket others an infrastructure rate back at\n'em it's classified as a rate but I just consider it an infrastructure playing clean and cleaner infrastructure and I think the market opportunity\nIs large going forward and um the risks are you know the risk to any stock in general is that you know if we had a recession you know maybe maybe there's not as many projects an infrastructure that would be a downside\nUm however because they're in a space where they invest in smaller size projects\nI think that's actually a competitive advantage for them relative to um maybe other types of infrastructure investors or or engineering and ... you know\nSo that is to be more of like being under a rock and under a cloud which is a good thing a lot of times that's undetected dug down you yes let's turn over

area\nAnd even then they approached um fracking conservatively\nBut now they're you know one of the you know they had some of the best well but what I also like about them as they're diversified um they have ... sets a chemical chemical business and export capabilities\nOf the price of oil do they need to make to make solid profits\nUm they they in a fifty dollar range line um that's that's where they they they do fine um that's kind of their break even threshold of what I'm yeah and so in oil prices are in a decent rain and and that's really not expect it to change you know\nConsiderably I think even let's just say hypothetically we had a recession and a year or two I just don't\nSee oil prices\nDown to the level that they did during the sort of\nNot not nearly that
