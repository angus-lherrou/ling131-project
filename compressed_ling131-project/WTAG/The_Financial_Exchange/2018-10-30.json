not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he's saying things to bring us a into conflict with each other you\nKnow and you're not saying anything

in the regular media at all but they're pro Second Amendment to people realize that Hitler took the guns away from the Jews and and then he and many force them into the to the ghettos\nIn Poland and then that the Jews go to the national Holocaust museum and see the guns that that they had that they were able to recover the Jews are buried and had used as part of the resistance to try to fight back\nSo you're going to tell me you shouldn't have an armed guard at a synagogue\nWhen you have when you have people like Farrah Khan calling Jews termites then you have Clinton and Obama and Allison

an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country legally or not is a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nThat are doing very well so there's a little bit of a flight to safety here a little bit of a natural correction\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of concern to your point\nAbout the impact of tariffs ... in in what that's going to mean the bottom lines and you know when you have your United Technologies which of course as a as a strong New England presence they come out and say that uh it's going to have a dramatic impact on their costs and it's going to hurt the profitability and the the statistic that really concerns me the most Barry\nIn terms of the fundamental things that matter here not just the rotation from high priced thoughts that that's just nature what concerns me fundamentally as when I heard a CNBC Stuart survey\nThat said one third of the companies that they talked to are looking at reducing research and development\nBecause of the money drain of the extra cost from the terror fan so here's a ... it seems to defeat the purpose of giving them tax breaks\nThe a lot of the rate is now going to pay for higher input costs\nSo ... and that's your criticism of the terrorists I think you have to recognize though John that\nWe're in a trade war and it's not ... and the key word there is not trade it's war and ... you know you've got an opponent in the Chinese who\nHas no integrity no morality no respect for intellectual property and they simply they take whatever is not tied down and that's that's the way they act culturally that is the way they feel towards American products they ... you know we're going to get into it during the course of the show but\nThey some of the actions on the part of the Chinese that we're learning about that I've been going on for ten and Twenty years\nThis is our response to it yet this is and and what else do you do you can't have a shooting war and again to your point I don't disagree I it may very well be the right thing to do\nBut as investors we have to kind of step back and try not to get too emotional about this and say okay whether this was justified or not what does it mean\nIt means higher import costs you know it means inflation it means you're not in technologies will earn less money it will mean Boeing will earn less money so we have to take pen to paper and say\nYou know going by and Walmart may actually make some ... compared to buying companies that are capital intensive and labor intensive but what I think what a lot of people are listening to John and they're saying hey you know the market's down I've lost quite a bit of money in the last thirty days how do I react to that what do I do\nIt's an ... I'll tell you what makes it even more complicated the fact that I think that the forty year bond bull market ended twenty eight months ago now\nYou know you and I swore light a ten year treasury today three twenty two twenty three exactly so\nYou know our whole investment live Mary we've always been supported by knowing if we had thirty percent and bonds that was protecting us yeah that was giving us a safe six percent yup that was helping protect everything is easy now if you're like hedging your overpriced technology\nStocks with long blond that's like protecting your investment in kerosene with investing and matches now I mean you're you're you're in the ... so the answer is cash has not been more attractive in the last ten years and it's okay to have cash in by the way whenever you're getting a cash is going to keep going higher you know\nSo that's in short term bonds safe bonds\nAnd I think the evidence stocks and I'll tell you something I'd been may call me crazy\nI put most of my cash to work in the last three weeks of him\nBecause I see great opportunity in safe dividend stocks one after another you\nGive us a couple of examples not that we think you should buy these stocks today but do like things that types of companies that you would look at I've been I've been buying funds and I'll give you an example I don't mean to endorse this but fidelity has a high\nDividend income from that is one hundred percent stocks all stock is all dividend payers it's an ATF from you ... and ... apple is a large holding so there's it's not like you're you're now you're a ... there's growth and there's financial kind of you do you get four percent wow\nYou know you know what I'll buy that off at a higher level yeah you put a hundred thousand into something like that and you say send me the day because you take the ... in cash right you don't have to reinvest correct you take the defending cash and they're going to send you a thousand bucks every quarter yep\n... again ... ... am I going to look stupid in six months I don't know how much but but yeah I could go to eighty but you're still going to get your four grand exactly and\nRemember this to folks about dividends these companies on average pay have payout rates of fifty percent mhm that means they're making twice as much money as they need to afford the division and companies are very reluctant to cut ...\nDespite will become later with each other not one but generally most years they go up\nAnd I generally tend to knock it cuts so I I see opportunity and the other thing is the market is cheap and weren't right now as we speak the market is at fourteen point eight times earnings yeah that is not a lot of\nYeah but to your point earlier if these terrorists screw earnings that ... you know how reliable is that ... and that's why\nAnd that's why we're going maybe a little bit lower than we should but the market is\nUp today by the way folks yep ... hundred and Ninety seven it's ... it's a weird day though he has futures were positive then they market opened up negative now the future now the market's up two hundred points\nThe president made a comment overnight but he looks forward to doing a good trade deals and wish Chinese shut up [laughter] the only oh he's doing is the stupid mistake he made yesterday\nWell I just I'm just reporting the facts and the the the Chinese took that as a very positive statement and I'll tell you something the common belief here\nIs that the Chinese are going to do a darn thing before election day to make him look good and that may be

operating in southern China are considering delaying further investments there and moving some for\nAll of their manufacturing to other countries as the trade war bites into profits this according to a business survey that was done John this is really the nightmare scenario for China this is why their economy is crumbling this is why their currencies devaluing and this is why their stock market's down dramatically here today this is\nYet another example of them arguably the most glaring example of why this really could hurt China a lot\nOf when you start seeing this this really does bite into their economy so what we're seeing as we're seeing collateral damage on both sides\nClearly China has more to lose than we do a which is adding some urgency clearly there markets have reacted even more adversely than our markets although our markets are starting to do poorly this month I'm so these are the stakes were were experiencing is nothing\nCompared to the Chinese John absolutely uh you know the impact of this for the United states will be\nPretty small you know um it it it may have an inflationary impact it may make us a little bit more insular in terms of how we deal\nMay hurt your

that's six hundred\nWell tough yeah I mean this is this is the the negative of what's happening but this is the new reality that were in these are the consequences that are\nThat we have for what is essentially a trade war and in China has a lot more to lose in the United states I I Do think this is setting up to some sort of negotiation\nTo come to agreement on on some of these key issues there's just too much at stake and also from the perspective of the United states you know the problem ... yeah I I Would like to agree with you I like I I've been wrong I Would love to agree with you but the the our cultural seeds I mean it's if you can green in their culture to steal\nAnd this is a separate issue and we have to if the if it is the issue but there's other issues with respect to products that we make and manufacture and sell\nAnd other products that they make in manufacturing self that we can come to some sort of agreement I mean I'm not sure why can't why should Boeing have to pay for an issue that has to do with apple\nI mean when it comes down to I mean I I Know what you're saying I I feel like we can address both you know I'm not sure we cannot I'm losing about because I don't trust them John on anything I don't trust them as far as I can throw them is just like I don't trust the Saudis\nYeah I ... if this is the case we're gonna have to really rely on domestic consumption and the consumption of allies now we're going to have a new world we're willing to work at a drill instead of China I mean that's\nThat right ... you're going to see companies move their manufacturing out of China and once they move they are not going back\nAnd and the problem in the meantime ... in the in the near term is that we have American companies are really good bet the farm on growth in China\nAnd we talked about John talking about your Starbucks and your General Motors yeah I mean General Motors sells more cars in China than the United states or you know they
