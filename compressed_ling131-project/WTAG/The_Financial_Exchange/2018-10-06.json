Collins\nShoot a great job should a great job look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel\nYour article fear and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nI Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors of very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party and not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one and the guy\nHad we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a fait accompli isn't not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process uh I Do think that um\nAmerica has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so hate filled and they would justify almost any action to get the sense that they want but I think the stain\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who are you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family I think those folks have to find a way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm sure that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case every battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I'm nervous that this victory happen too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate for politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue\nIn the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm goes but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled to a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country until the same thing that if the Republican Party kids have to keep this problem was the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of share that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where my heart just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud of Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant a Fox is you know they give it a big huge hug and I've been a real critical of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never truckers and it's come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional is a Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans\nAnd Trump supporters and\nMost of that coalition or conservative I think that there's great promise now more promise than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap a I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nLet's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and ...\nAnd uh Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together and that's why we're where we are\nWhen you're a hundred percent correct\nHe deserves credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that is ... you know not done yet a tomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee ticket shepherd shepherded through the Senate\nAnd under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rough just which you get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal\nAnd a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up ... autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nAs a if you're in northern Delaware it's blue is could be and I'm surrounded by socialist communist an anarchist there some nice people they just don't understand the world\nThey don't understand I've been blessed to be on a pretty ... on the faculty of ages medical school that I won't mention um they don't know what to do with me and I am the token you know a conservative carrion\nUm and for me what is absolutely mind numbing it how very very bright people\nCan be you know literally so brainwashed by mainstream media that they you know even though there are no facts or being\nA doctor for it and lots of questions that remain on answer um regarding motivation and even just the wrath of the of some of the things she said\nAnd they wait for all these things\nAnd I think the worst of a judge Kavanaugh you know if I went back to pointed out\nWell I go back to everything that Chris Matthews said the day he was nominated it's only ten seconds long but this was Chris Matthews June twenty eighth of this year's\nTime for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance hell with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nSo it was all about vengeance it was and you know about revenge so I I just uh I'm stunned by it but yeah we all we all have liberal friends and we have to kind of be quiet around them I've been sending kitten videos to people in the last two days\nBecause I knew we were going to make it across the finish line or a doctor you have a jingle I've got thirty seconds left you have a jingle the torture you every day\nI'm not a fan of the doctor pepper on the effort she's a ... would you like to be a factor too I just it it that would just play over and over my head\nOK I'm putting that on the list goes right with spaghetti us and if you think it's butter but it's not as fun I'm of pepper Europe pepper yeah\nThat was a horrible one thank you Dr I'll see you somewhere in the region you never know where all turn up in Baltimore Michael

I'm right here in the middle of the blue part of our state trying to make sure free speech freedom libertarianism and capitalism are going to thrive not just survive thrive we're talking about the day\nWe're talking about Susan Collins a speech that Lindsey Graham even said while Lindsey Graham I we talk to if you will hear half an hour ago we're talking with match slap to the American Conservative Union\nOr you know Matt he's the white haired guy you see on Fox and even on MSNBC uh and and we're talking about the fact that months ago if you would have said Mitch McConnell Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham would be the three stars of the G O P we'd all go get outta here go home you're drunk\nBut there we are and we're talking to you guys about today and we're also talking about horrible jingles because I'm trying to get some of the horrible jingles on my head\nAnd we've been reminded of some of the old ones like uh oh spaghetti owes and if you think it's butter but it's not\nIt's shift on Georgian Pennsylvania is checking in George tests due to my friend\nMy great great trading here\nNo thank you I you know bucking I go way way way back to the early days of the blaze and now that we're both\nAre no longer at the blaze but this show still on the blaze radio it's kinda cool you know it's kind of cool for us to all be together again so I'm really thankful for the opportunity what's on your mind tonight\nI hate the way we let the Democrats set the tone of this this they tried to turn it into his ideas are radical art or not radical wrong he's got bad ideas he's got that if\nYou have to worry about how his upbringing and all that kind of stuff she's an originalist\nAn originalist follow the law is in Turkey interprets the law the way it was written which was the whole idea of how long the first place when you have judges on doing that and rewriting law which you end up with that you end up with a committee\n... at a dictatorship it's a dictatorship by committee but it's still a dictatorship they're making all new laws they're making new rights their reinterpret the ... the light which in a in a totally\nTotally devoid of were originally started and we've got a week they're going to be hammering on this we've got a week to turn this around and try to explain what an original list it does as a judge and the fact that it's exactly what the constitution designed was designed for\n... George or a hundred percent correct and part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves but Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media\nDana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that it we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it we don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago with constitution week\nAnd I guarantee the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and uh I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws are reinterpret the laws are I I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed in a record rate and I think what's happened\nThere not just mad at Kavanaugh I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so\nThe ... the ... the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches\nIt was just designed as a referee on the court\n... well on the basketball court right there but there there were designed to be the referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there\nIt's just so happens to position the ant directly over the colonies trails which of course increase the chances that it's going to in fact more ants and so when the fungus growing through the muscles this wouldn't make sense right if it's\nKind of destroying these muscles how's it been ordering the ant\nOut of the colony and this is\nReally pull him in our research but what they're thinking is that it was actually acting as a kind of\nNervous system of itself so it's actually replacing the nervous system\nOf the ... so it might be releasing neuro transmitters that mimic those of the ... owned by to actually manipulate individual muscles so it's like a puppet master\nPolling strength and that's just it's stunning how this could have and fall but it probably happened small step by small ... started more simple than that of course but these extra manipulations help the fungus probably get it ... into more and and that's what led to the developed with is extremely complex\nManipulation but nevertheless is happening\nI can guarantee you that that's happening it's real life you know it's happening out there and they you\nKnow it's kinda crazy as it takes about three weeks for the fungus to grow with inside the end and you talk about how I mean it's so crazy how delicate this procedure is because you know ... living this colony when they noticed something is amiss in another end sicker stumbling are acting weird\nAnother ... will literally come and take it pick it up and throw it down to its death you know away from the colony protecting the colony\nSo the fungus has to be very careful that it doesn't trigger something weird in the end that it it's going to trigger one of the other answer and suspected of being some type of intruder\nSo how does that work how does the funniest delicately moving around this because at the very end as you said when it makes it go bike the leaf or the tree branches something that's the point it takes over the brain kind of but before that the end is still operating normally it within the colony\nThat that's a really cool thing about ... you know I I don't want him to the short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happened\nTo be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals before they wreak havoc on the the rest of the call anyone of that a path to the fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years and ants which then as you mentioned the fungus faster\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so that scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical aunt so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of missing out bad actors in the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ...\nThat's a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characters they bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus had\nBeen doing the wrong time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the and in the colony but that might get it found out in that would get dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you just stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive its host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms in the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms that doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree so this is as I mentioned this is an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex because the ant colony is it south extremely complex and able to sniff out the sort of manipulation is the ... is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball\nTo avoid detection and really pull off this downing like complex devious\nAnd that's how we get this zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus has a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in South Carolina I think uh we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the hummus is ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of at least that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the ban of elite but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch\nThat it can maintain your around even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a purchase your ticket have purchased on the vein of elite biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states is as the\nFungus there's ordering the ... to bite onto the flag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then orders the answer rap its legs around the the way and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that\nStamp and that's just all the more power to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because in the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will\nOver winter just sitting there on the stem biding his time and then once the spring comes around or then finally arrived at at the back of a head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest it doesn't it in a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adopted two really ruin a day of the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the\nMany many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species the worms do it to crickets their war or to the crickets the jump into water which is not of course great the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then ...\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation\nRabies actually is a very well known\nParasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so the book is about the wide range of parasites the\nReally incredible range of parasites more than you'd ever imagine that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique ways whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering structures in the brain so it's called the living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration hope is\nVery strange kingdom of species that are really ruining the days of their house\nJust reading about the ants in of itself is so interesting so thank you very much Matt Simon staff writer at wired author of plight of the living dead check out the book thank you for joining us\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAll right that's it for us this week and be sure to check out the daily die every Monday to friday\nJoined us on social media daily diets hot on Twitter daily podcast on these [noise]\nLeave us a comment give us a rating tell us your stories that you're interested in\nAll of the daily diving I heart radio subscribe wherever you get to watch\nThe daily died was produced by random er into an engineered by Tony ... [noise] I'm Oscar winners in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\n\nWaiting a final vote I'm Pam who sales Fox News in just a few hours the Senate is expected to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court just not safe Kevin how far is live on Capitol Hill\nTo me it ... you may think that's not a lot but Susan you and I remember multiple years of zero increases mhm sure not too long ago last year point three percent increase yeah so those are no increases so I'm at least excited that it's almost a three percent increase yeah\nSo for every thousand dollars you're receiving Social Security it's twenty bucks\nSo put that in perspective the average paycheck from Social Security is about fourteen hundred dollars a month across country average so that's going to amount to about thirty nine dollar larger check per month so does when he put it in money you know it's fourteenth thirty nine instead of fourteen hundred\nUm however as you might imagine it's not a lot and it's probably not really keeping up with inflation to speak so since Nineteen eighty two to two thousand seven the CPI consumer price index has risen about three percent on average\nVersus the elderly population three point three percent\nA sort of what their spending and where there was where they're headed floods\nGot to be because the health care costs right they're spending more and healthcare\nHere it is sixty five in over ... and you hit the nail on the head expect to spend two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars on health care if you're sixty five and over and retiring and guess what that does not include\nLong term care expand nursing home ... yeah that's that's a bonus yeah okay so that's where the out nursing homes so that is up six percent from a year earlier now the thing that's being missed here is that the elderly population spends Fifteen Percent on medical care\nWhereas the regular urban worker spend seven percent so it's it's skewed right in terms of what's happening so and finally Medicare part B has increased a hundred and Ninety five percent from two thousand to today\nIt went from forty five dollars and fifty cents to a hundred and thirty four dollars so I'm fairly certain that you're cola adjustment is going to be wiped out by the Medicare part B increased yeah but you know at least to something folk so I just wanted to give you that's more of a an F. Y. segment\nIf you will yeah and you know if you think about that two hundred and Seventy five thousand I think you said the average person will spend on those healthcare costs\nEven if you are in a more reasonable nursing home here and it's ten thousand dollars a month and I'm only taken that in part because it's easy math for me right you know what they're using them as high a sixteen grand a month here in Massachusetts so\nAt a hundred and twenty thousand plus per year how quickly are your assets going to be wiped out if you and your spouse or go into a nursing home or you or your spouse we had we certainly do have clients who are both positive have ended up in the air and it's it's it's not on it but it can happen\nBut I don't have to be the same time it could be one and then another Clinton leave him there and you've got a plan for\nBoth and you know what a lot of people don't do their planning in advance and maybe we can just kind of remind folks Todd that what we mean when we talk about doing advanced planning which is what's outlined in this guide in terms of timelines\nShore well if you're going to do your advanced planning it's still the five year rule and it's good to bring that up occasionally because I'm Still getting people out there who will tell me oh I heard it's going to be seven I I heard it's going to be ten yeah\nYou know I haven't heard that lately folks I Know there was a bill many years ago where they propose that I'm pretty sure it's dead in committee and I'm not trying to scare people but five years are still five years mhm and and I would hurry I Would get my ball rolling\nAnd what we're talking about putting in these trust when we talk about funding the trust I mean your your primary residence as a no brainer but there are assets that can't be protected right in the ...\nThat's true and so what you're not going to put in these trust would be things like IRAs four oh one case\nAny kind of a retirement account that requires minimum distributions to come out or that is not taxed yet ... and the reason is you can't put them in because if you reach in to pull them out\nYou have an income taxable event ... so you're not going to take five hundred thousand dollars out of your Ira and put it in a trust and give the government forty percent right you just won't do it so that's money you live on\nFirst and that you spend down for us because that money is going to be continue to be at risk or the expenses\nAnd live on it that's why it's there that's why you saved it put the other assets in the real estate the vacation home the rental property your taxable investment accounts put those in the trust and and I think that's important and and um are these the kinds of things that we were talking about right not just how to crawl around\nHis stuff is in the guy but I don't really find out how to fund the trust what type of assets go in there what type of acids don't go in there you know there is there's a whole there's a couple of pages about\nProblematic trust provision so for folks who are out there that already have a trust this is a good sanity check for them to say wait a minute I have this paragraph or I have this paragraph you don't want to find out when you're going into the nursing home that you have a troublesome trust right so look\nAt the different kinds of paragraphs that are in there and and you

back at the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nMike we just entered the last quarter of the year and investors often associate the month of October with poor stock market returns how are things looking\nFor this year yeah you know you're right October's oftentimes singled out for poor performance that mainly has to do with some of the particularly severe stock market crashes we've seen in the past\nYou know this negative sentiment reflects a historic crash the Nineteen twenty nine eighty seven and then of course most recently in October of two thousand eight when the Dow collapsed the full Eighteen percent in a week\nWhich by the way was the single worst we can do history going all the way back in Ninety One additional that's involved to watch over months are back in Seventy eight Seventy nine in Nineteen eighty nine all of which added this negative October sentiment so I'm sure some\nOf this is coincidence is there anything different about twenty teen though\nYou know there is I mainly that we're in a midterm election year and that changes a lot you know if you look back to Nineteen fifty they're Seventeen different midterm election years and you'll find that the Dow averaged a three point one percent gain in those specific mid term October months\nIn fact of the Seventeen election years twelve of them ended with a positive stock market return you're taking this a bit further mid term elections seem to be a positive indicator for the stock market over the next three quarters the nine months stretch from October before mid term election and then June after the election is produced average returns of twenty point four percent of the doubt\nAnd Twenty one point one percent for the S. and P. five hundred and that goes straight back to Nineteen forty nine so we all know the past performance can't be used to predict future results but I Would pump the brakes if you associate October with only negative market returns produce history does tell us otherwise\nThanks make folks if you have questions about the markets the economy or your portfolio please visit us that Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with time ... and Susan ... hours\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that's including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan Bowers\nBack to I have a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from David in Framingham mass in David writes my father has been in ... in a nursing home in on Medicaid for the past year and I've been maintaining his home by paying the taxes utilities and maintenance\nFor swimming houses in his name and dad's name I guess ...\nI don't want to do anything to jeopardize his Medicaid eligibility but I cannot afford to keep doing this and the house is worth around five hundred thousand what am I an option [noise]\nWow [noise] that's a that's a nice size house I'm well treated go folks let's let's explain let's delve into this a question a little deeper ah first of all you know the the first thing that comes to my mind is you know how did that get eligible for Medicaid when he has a house right\nRemember folks own past shows we have spoken about how a home is a non accountable last as long as is located in mass and you're single and check the box that I intend to return home\nAnd it's under eight hundred and fifty roughly eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of assets of value mhm he's there so folks that's a message to all of us to how he's on Medicaid even though he has this home\nSo for all of you who have not done planning a that is at least a way of still getting on Medicaid so I I\nI get that he's also absolutely right that have as a single person\n[noise] somebody's got to pay the maintenance and upkeep of that house right keep the heat on well that's the kids ... kids I I don't know what your financial options are but let me give you a little motivate motivate motivation here and that would be\nIf she passes away\nAnd you get the house you can have a five hundred thousand dollar home with no mortgage right and with a step up and basis so you could actually sell this for five hundred thousand dollars in have zero\nZero capital gains tax and zero estate tax mhm federal and state so it is a big win right even if I had to get a mortgage on our home equity line of credit just to pay a little bit so sometimes you need to understand that I can take out a he lock on my own home get a tax deduction\nAnd use this money in and sit in a in a bucket just to make these you know what does it cost to maintain that house ten grand a year I don't know\nBetween taxes depending on where it is yeah taxes and keep the utilities on and so that's probably high so so that's one option that is one mortgage out on his own home so that he can pay\nYeah the ... the only other option and that's the one I'm leaning towards the only other option here folks would be to sell the house which you absolutely can do and if you sell the house or you could\nYou could take the money or probably get there might be a tax on a vacation number one cause if you sell it and dad gets a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar capital gains exclusion there might be more than two hundred and fifty thousand of gained built into the sounds right so you might have a capital gains tax liability don't know how to run those numbers\nEven at that though Todd now dad's got a big bucket calf\nShe's going to be booted off Medicaid unless you can either by a medicated knew what are your throat into a pool trust mhm so not a great option right I'm going keep it how else could you keep it you could rent it okay so if you rent it out now you'll have the money you need to pay\nThe bills because while that will be rental income for dad yeah income is treated differently than an asset so renting it is not going to cause him to come off Medicaid\nAnd let's say you rent it you get to use the rent dad gets to use the rent to pay all the bills mhm and only the excess rent\nWould end up going to the nursing home and you don't care 'cause that's somebody else's money right and now the child\nThe child's ability to borrow or pay for this property is gone mhm it will be maintained especially with no debt you know it will be maintained by their rent mhm you would definitely be able to generate enough rent\nTo maintain the property with access rent going to the nursing home to pay a bill and that will help to reduce\nThe amount of the lean that's been placed on that home 'cause it's he's qualify for Medicaid so that will help you in the end as\nWell so good point Susan what Susan's talking about there is that even though this house for a single person is non accountable\nIs ... ... so that means whatever amount of money the state is paying\nOn behalf of dad in this case\nIs a lean on the house and so if we have Social Security of two thousand going to the nursing home\nAnd now we can pick up a thousand a month extra on the rent yeah the net rent mhm now there's three thousand dollars a month going so the amount the state is paying drops from four to three right and so the lean\nIs less I say four to three because for pay on Medicaid is about six mhm so\nThat's a great 'cause that's where I mean when I Would do or hear the rent it David so rent that a dad like the way to guys\nFolks if you would like to not have to worry about this last minute ... that you have to do with your assets you're planning in advance\nTodd has written a guide for all of us designing in income on your income only ... trust and it is the type of trust you need if you want to protect those assets from those long term care expenses\nGet your free copy right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com or you can download your free copy\nTodd our last question comes from Brian in ... with math and Brian writes my father died in a nursing home and twenty Seventeen while receiving medicate\nAnd the state contacted me with a bill for his nursing home care can they make me pay the bill he gave me is home seven years before he went into a nursing home and only held the life of state other than that he didn't own anything the bill was around sixty five thousand do I need to pay this\nYou know this is a great question and folks what they're driving at here and what\nBrian is sort of bringing to the forefront is this thing called a state recovery mhm right\nWe just talked about how they could have been a lean on a person's house right and when he died the state would say okay kids you're going to get a bill for what we paid on behalf of\nThe person who was in the nursing home that being said they're going to say you need to pay us because we have a lean on your on dad's house because that in that previous example owned it in his name",
