happy learned how to put up a quick question though yeah man I got a question for you were talking about the a job in the beginning of the segment um last week we had that um Obama clip where he talked about or his\nOr when he was a youth to hell he got in the fight than you were mentioning how you know probably didn't happen um who would win and Obama Jeb Bush but\nLike if they stepped into the octagon put on the pad and actually that's a really that's a really a tough one yeah I mean I'm I'm a new energy or so it all I keep saying this I I think I think Obama\nProblem I think Obama probably takes them I just think Jeb is just a wimp and like you know Obama's probably got some ... I think a bottom at it I Know everyone's blowing you right now look I call it like I see it All right I call it like I see it\nA shot to think of what would be ... will be some other fun octave octagon UFC style matchups with various Paul well first of all I mean I think he would take like any Democrat oh heaven or downhill here with all the ... the GOP has got a lot more ringers for the octagon in their in their senior government ranks then uh\nYou know the than anywhere else I mean I can tell you this\nIf it were if it were between Biden let's say and fighting and McConnell I think would be interesting I probably think that\nBy ... you know a little dirty huh but McConnell also had that you don't remember you ever have like your ... you ever get on the wrong side of your grandpa and I felt like Rand Paul is kind of old but then he actually grab you know like oh my gosh grandpa was old man's right yeah\nI think that ... yeah I agree with that yeah do you have to do the turtles journals are all about surprised yeah snapping turtles look all slowing cute until you ask a finger that's how McConnell would fight flow and was that he wins re he'd be all methodical and ... and you know\nI think so I think that's a fair point so we should do we do record cigarettes like these two politicians gotta gotta go fight who who would come out on top oh you know that would be a great one cruise in O'Rourke oh yeah crews that are worth because we got ... swamp fight club we got that one\nA swamp fight club that's Louis do you think about this though Cruz took Jimmy Kimmel to school and the basketball court just took him to school\nAnd Kimmo was really ... um a lot and if you see some of the video it was really trying hard and give all thought he was going to win cruise but you know what cruise all about the fundamentals do just like he's all about the constitution when it comes to the law and when it comes to basketball Cruz is all about like boxing out and I bet you in like a wrestling match\nCruise would go with like straight out of the book like double a takedown armed bar you know half Nelson you probably studies all the maneuvers yeah\nYou know whereas beta unless unless he can you know knocked back a six pack and get into a car beforehand I don't think he's too dangerous right oh yeah All right\nHow do you go I think the only way that yeah go when he got what you got to say one thing I think we learned\nFrom the second is that uh whether it's in the arena of ideas are actually in the arena in a ring services will always come out on top [noise]\nI think that's what I think that's the perfect place for us to leave us because that is that is in fact we take away\nOur team we've got more coming up actually my friend regime [noise] 'cause some will be

rain great to have you back\nGreat to be able to give people what they want but [noise]\nIndeed a man a man of the people don't want to ask Scott spoil you everybody now tell me about what's going on with a with the the regulation you know we like to get a view from the rest of the world ... her worldly fellow and you obviously are are Brits are so what's going on with pizzas in the United kingdom\n[noise]\nWe we as you know we have a a buddy regulates your environment in Europe the United kingdom specifically a\nAnd the viewer cracks to God our help I have decided the pizza is the next target are are they are there is an organization called public health England um it is a sort of\nWatchdog and regulates your in the United kingdom invasive\nNow said ah the ah pizzas should be kept in the terms in terms of how many calories a should be sold\nA each getting towards the cheese the toppings\nAll that kind of thing and and plus the supermarkets take away a you know teach a delivery places have I got\nIn the government's words\nTo ... ... she's cautious and of course unfortunately whenever there was talk of these crises fingers get pointed at the United states and say we don't want to be like them or are we going to reach a certain way\nAnd this I think it's not just going to apply to pizza buckets going to talk to a almost take portions labeled\nNine hundred and twenty calories in any takeaway portion which would kind of restrict I think for the McDonald's menu but and and and and so on and so forth [noise]\nUm so it's it's it's it's been sort of the subject of quite a lot of jokes over the last twenty four hours won't get but unfortunately I'm it's entirely true er which makes us to jail\nAnd is the pizza and the u._k. anything that anybody really wants to eat it let's be honest I have no idea I'm really asking but\n\nDominoes the best you can get in London do they have some pretty good pizza\n[laughter] your average your average Chicago in the New Yorker would not want them and by the London pizza um but uh but it's you know it's not a terrible uh you know I've I've had the pizza in England many many times as my outlined shows\nUm but uh it's not just the paint is I mean think about the largest\nUh take away food product in the United kingdom is ... don't occur vibes lamb and could buy chicken about I mean none of that would come in under nine hundred and twenty calories portion so when you add a lovely garlic sauce and all that stuff on top and the chips on this all the prize as you say on the side I'm so this is really actually going to\nI think hit a lot of people in their pockets quite seriously because they're not actually going to be less well they're gonna have to do is lose double portions\nAre always going to say they they they can't they're not making you have like a friend come with you so you can easily get one slice or one ... I think\nThey might ... we're not far off from having police officers in every state wave watching with purchasing um but yeah I mean it it really sticking speaking there's nothing to stop me going okay I'd like one slice of pizza place\nAnd then going back to the front of a lot of going and I'd like another slice of pizza place I mean maybe it's going to enforce that so it's going to be paying double it's going to be you know again this is this is regressive because who is the oldest most of the takeaways is actually working class people\nPeople who work very hard long hours doesn't have time to cook I'm so and so forth um so so you know we might joke about it but there are serious ramifications for this stuff and it's the same as\nAny government sort of regulation whether it be energy taxes will fuel taxes at all it's a the ordinary person in the pocket the hottest\nAnd tell me a bit about this story with with Amazon you brought this to my attention rain Amazon is giving money to well some charities that folks should know about what's going on\n[noise] [noise]\nThere's this ... this is really quite serious I mean I'm just one has this program called smile wearing it to a certain dates a portion of its profits are from anything you buy through through jak feeds off says\nA company a to a list of charities and you can choose which charity you want to give to where you can say hey Amazon you know you make by mind up on\nOf for profit skilled nursing homes around the country and a few nonprofit to agreed that the payment system needs to be restructured but they did push back against the studies methodologies saying that it was to narrow the population to be generalize about but the author of this study strongly disagreed with that claim\nAnd then if you have a family member that might be in a nursing home or something or you might suspect that some of this stuff is going on or they're getting too many treatments things like that what can you do to get a little more involved\nWhat I can say that\nThat was published I received email responses with love wines concern for their family members care and also reporting instances where they feel that their family has made some kind of trauma related to this issue\nIs kind of an unknown you know a family members they're being treated and you trust the people there so you don't know what's going on especially you know if you're not checking in every moment that you have so there's a level of trust there and reports like this come out and it gives you cause for concern\nMany experts that I spoke to from ... in the nursing industry and also with an advocacy group have said that there's a great lack of information surrounding the payment profit thing and the treatment that these patients are getting\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week we've all heard stories about passengers flying with uh the cats and their dogs in some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses it's people flying with their emotional support animals\nAnd you'll deliver is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a duck wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen the deprecating pigs unfortunately the latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrel or I'm Sorry her emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy the stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flight so if it seems to be some type of policy okay that could have been figured out she called in advance so he said the flight was traveling for\nAnd do the Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had\nTo call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in and of itself is a huge pain there was a fun facts I think you can share this rent a frontier airlines features a variety animals on the tails of its plant\nYeah so they're saying is that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar Semitic or of course\nThey did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them because we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses there it is again miniature horses seem to be the other one and the question then becomes how do people get emotional support animals\nI feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better it was actually a protocol that you need to go through to have an emotional support in well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain and emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed you have to actually go to a mental health professional right and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental illness or met emotional disability you may have\nAnd from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they'd be well behaved and not jerks in public radio don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support him cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo and they can be any age it can be happy it can be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't going to run around and cause a bunch of trouble but\nLess than a delta spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administered flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people for those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctors now is what I\nMean there's even Web sites where you can go on line fill out a yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to your friend's wedding\nThat's just ... it's a tough thing because\nRiding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's going to happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane it's already going to be a problem\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulent starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate if they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already opposite\nAnd it'll cause that anxiety or you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you did get anxious what would your emotional support animal be and it can be a cat or dog has got to be a little ... something a little more exotic\nOkay cause might go to is I'm going to bring my dog I ... I Would have\nBrought my own dog as well but you can't do that this is something\nIn the line of a ... and hamsters can I have an emotional support turtle there you go that's a that's a good one they're quiet kind of cute and calm that's true that's my animal turtle I think my emotional support animal would be a flop\n[laughter] because they moved again they're quiet they don't get into too much action but I'll take that long I think that'd be cute and something fun to a good conversation started Oh thank you Miranda thanks okay [laughter]\n[noise]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend be sure to check out the daily died every Monday through friday joined us on social media at daily diet of pot on Twitter\nAnd daily podcast and\nLeave us a comment give us a rating tells a story that you're interested in\nAll of the daily diving I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your pocket\nThe daily died was produced by random er into an engineered by Tony store and you know [noise] I'm Oscar members in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is the Fox news alerts and American Pop star is home I'm Pam who sell\nYour lawyer in your state and make sure that the state law doesn't prohibit them okay some states are are corky about this but nobody seemed to work across the board but\nA promissory notes might might not everywhere although the federal regulations provide for a promissory note so I'm not entirely sure how estate can ban it mhm let's put it that way uh so what what is a promissory note well first of all promissory noticed like instead of\nPurchasing annuity yeah thrown investment company you could actually lend money not to to a family member so you give them the money yeah and then they use that money obviously to pay you back ...\nUnder the terms of a promissory note well obviously these promissory note terms have to have\nCertain rules that you have to follow much like the annuity very specific requirements they have to be correct so remember before you think about the annuity one somebody should be in the nursing home yeah obviously you've got to make sure that Smith\nYou also gotta make sure that you've met the other requirements so for a single person that after the a promissory note is established\nThat you have either if you're single less than two thousand dollars\nMhm otherwise you'll be over assets right and then you'd be denied when you apply for Medicaid because you have too many dollars not because you did a promise or right\nSo you want to make sure that after the promissory note is done you have less than two thousand dollars if you're single or if you're married the community spouse has less than a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars right 'cause I remember\nThere's the community spousal resource allowance that you're allowed to keep\nA when one spouse goes into the nursing home so why would you want to do a promissory note versus an annuity for an insurance company I'm definitely going to get to that I just want to explain what a promissory note is how it works and then you had an annuity and how it works and I don't want to compare the two okay so\nThose are some things otherwise also make sure your monthly income is not larger than the Medicaid rate\nAnd again remember the payments from the promissory notes some of it will be interest some of it will be returned to principals so that won't be income right okay so great so those are three basic requirements before you were to even think about doing ... or\nA promissory note or an annuity ... remember even with the annuity you're going to want to make sure that you're you're a community spousal resource allowances met and your two thousand dollar\nAsset limit for a single person is Matt\nAnd this is you would use either one of those when you have too many assets in your it's everything over\nThere right in front amounts I got it okay ... you know so it's it's these are the dollars that you can keep everything over that is considered an excess resource\nAnd you would be denied medicate yeah because everything over two thousand dollars is so excessive right the first day to just grazing is so if you're single and you have more than two thousand you're denied that's why you think about this if you're married and you have more than a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars for the community spouse then you're denied right\nOkay so\nHow does it what is the no I have to say itself to uh to work one it needs to be actual warily sound ... what is that what is that so it needs to pay out over the life expectancy of the borrower\nOkay so you can't take out a note that is longer than the life expectancy of couldn't be thirty mile promissory note if someone's in their eighties right okay that's exactly right you have to look up these tables that are put together\nAnd they'll tell us what the age life expectancy has it doesn't matter what your health is just matters you look to age and then you look to life expectancy on the table and it tells you OK so like I think uh Seventy five year old is like twelve years okay just to give you an example\nNext so that's one number two they must have level payments when I say level payments I mean payments that stay the same throughout the term of the loan okay monthly payments right and they got to start or you also can't have\nDeferred or balloon payments in other words you start immediately yeah you've got all start immediately account for and you can't have times where you're not paying was a big balloon payment at the end at the end All right it's got to be level payments from beginning to end has to be actual warily sound\nAnd here's really the

performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nMake many of our listeners are approaching retirement and the next few years what does some of the key issues that we're seeing out\nThere now well you know saving for retirement can be quite difficult and require serious disciplined\nBut honestly the process of adjusting your portfolio for retirement is one that requires an equally serious strategy that\nOftentimes overlooked for starters it's important to consider a few key factors such as life expectancy you know you might need your retirement savings to last upwards of Thirty years or more these days the other big issue we frequently Caesar retirees plan for either too much\nOr too little stock market volatility retirement\nYou're either stance can lead to detrimental results and retirement if you don't consider\nAll of the other related factors unfortunately there's just not a good rule of thumb for all retirees\n... so what makes up a sound retirement strategy\nWhen you formulate your strategy definitely identify all of your potential income sources you don't want to take Social Security and pension into consideration first for instance and then during her time it is usually smart to think about covering your essential day to day expenses but just regular fixed income sources\nAnd then when you're discretionary expenses commend those can be paid for you know well with other sources of assets or income there are a lot of factors to consider when developing our plans such as inflation healthcare costs market volatility insurance needs\nAnd that's just naming a few so with all these realities in mind we decided to put together a guide this month\nTo help address some of these initial questions when it comes to specifically preparing for your retirement years the name of the guide is how to develop a retirement income strategies only available this month from the Armstrong advisory group\nThinks my folks to download a copy of this month guide how to develop a retirement income strategy visit our website Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street weaken review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with time ... and Susan ... hours\nListening to the legal exchange and it's done for us this and we were taught will answer your questions about anything and everything that we could be as big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan or [noise]\nA few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Brian in Milton math and Brian writes my sixty six year old wife was diagnosed with the progressive form of Parkinson's disease about Eighteen months ago\nShe currently has an IRA valued at around two hundred thousand in listening to many of your past radio programs you've mentioned an emergency action of buying an annuity with all of the funds of the IRA what are the mechanics of purchasing this annuity if and when necessary in is the annuity income protected or at risk\nRight in line boy and what we were just talking about\nYeah so that that's good and I know the last thing we we spent maybe more time on the promissory note side of the equation and\nYou know you probably could do the promissory note side of the equation here as well but let's focus on the annuity since that wasn't the question we spent time with the with the note but here's how the annuity would work so one\nYou know because it's an IRA I Want you to know that even though it's an IRA you could not have\nPlanned in advance for it so I don't want to tell anybody here that the planning in advance could help because IRAs cannot be put into trust in advance without paying a a exorbitant tax ...\nAnd even if there's going to be attacks do now I Would always wait to incur the tax until somebody is in the nursing home yet I don't want to pay in advance and even then\nAnd I might have to ask some questions here although Parkinson's is not a disease that takes your life quickly\nSo it's likely that this is something that could be ongoing mhm right so I say that because even when somebody comes in and says you know we want to go on Medicaid in in a lot of their money is tied up in an IRA yet I still ask the questions about\nHow is the health of the person in the nursing home because now says right because if it's going to be short term\nI'm not sure I Want to encourage the huge tax liability if I'm going to be paying more in taxes than I Would have paid the nursing home mhm right so but I'm pretty sure in this case you know it's probably going to be long term so\nAnd the dollar amounts not overly large right so what happens\nThis two hundred thousand dollars like when I was explaining the annuity in the prior segment\nIs going to put the community spouse over\nA hundred and twenty three six mhm now I don't know what other assets are are but let's just assume for now there really isn't any maybe let's say maybe there's fifty grand mhm well the fifty grand and the bank account can go to the community spouse husband yeah in this case\nLeaving us with this two hundred thousand which is in her higher re exactly and that's the glitz you and that's the great question that that's here is this is in her IRA so she can have more than two yeah so we need to get this out of her\nIRA you can't have part of his one twenty three six be left in her name and your IRA correct so that oh so you need to get it all out and come out so that two hundred becomes what yeah when something no one can take the whole two hundred oh no no I Know but I have to pay the taxes on it\nRight so now the mechanics are you have to take it out because I Can't allocated to her a hundred and twenty three ... but in terms of the annuity I'm going to purchase yes yes so I've got fifty and I'm going to take two hundred and put it over to her side of the ledger now as you said Susan when I Do that\nAnd I pull two hundred outta that Ira I'm going to create a income tax liability race good news is maybe prior to going into the nursing home this year\nThis tax year they might have incurred some medical expenses ... if they did then this can offset oh yeah the ... tax hit but yes it will be a taxable event ...\nFor the individual yeah okay so now I pay the taxes and and let's say we we lose twenty grand in taxes mhm okay I don't know even if you're going to the top rate you know I I Can't imagine it's going to put you more than the thirty percent bracket row\nTwo times three sixty grand mhm so say so you lose fifty grand yet so you're down to a hundred and fifty plus he's got fifty mhm so now we're\nTwo hundred thousand left yet we know a hundred and twenty three six would be non accountable mhm so yes now that this community spouse has the money we can allocate it\nAnd then that leaves the excess the excess would then be a new type so about Seventy five grand in this case ... so then we would take the Seventy five grand and we would buy an annuity in the name of the healthy spouse and that would convert that asset into an income stream\nAnd it would it would the annuity company would pay a monthly check to the community spouse\nWhich is now non ... income right because it's converted to income now\nSick spouse can go on Medicaid and we've saved\nSo I'm not at risk for Brian because it's in his name it's not going to be in his\nWife correct Soviet on that we converted to is not at risk anymore\nAnd you know what folks if you have been thinking about creating an area vocal trust because you're concerned about protecting those assets\nTodd's guide is going to be really helpful for you it's designing an income only eerie vocal trust in your trust is only as good as the drafting folks\nTodd's guide includes important
