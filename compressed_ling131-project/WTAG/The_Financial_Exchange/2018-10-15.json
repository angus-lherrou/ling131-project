Ga Ga HD Worcester and I argue radio station [noise]\nThe president's talked to the king I'm Dave Anthony Fox News and us study relations are at stake over the believed murder of a missing journalist at the Saudi ... turkey\nHis denials I make it out of the song that he had no knowledge that it sounded like he had also the British had no knowledge of\nThere is a concern I think it's a valid concern that this dispute that we seem to be entering with Saudi Arabia could cause energy prices to spike quite dramatically explain why\nSo this actually I think could be a bigger thing than just energy prices this this has the potential if if it spirals the wrong way to end up with a complete restructuring of world market\nI'm pretty much what happened is last week there was this journalist\nOr for the Washington Post ... ... ah who disappeared while he was in Turkey um the Turkish government a suggestion and provided you know some evidence saying hey we think that he was killed in dismembered inside the Saudi embassy they know they know which rules he was dismembered it well that's what they say okay\nThe number of members of the U.S government have pretty much back the Turkish stores saying hey this is what we think happened as well er and then you have the Saudi Government saying well we don't know anything about as we know we didn't do anything we don't we don't know what's going on\nBut the ... nothing the reason why sergeant shots in in a hotel we are the reason why this has the potential to be really disruptive\nIs twofold number one obviously Saudi Arabia's the biggest oil producer in the world right okay so they they are the biggest and they are the low cost producer as well\nAnd they can take they they can lower worldwide production by as much as ten percent if they chose if they want it to ... and they could cause prices well how could they cause prices that cause there's Shrek earlier if the prices double\nNow that if if they said we're ... wrote a report said you know you could see two hundred dollar oil if if Saudi Arabia want it to sustain oil now they would be inflicting a tremendous amount of pain on themselves if they did that though\nThey would I mean again that when you talk about the economy of Saudi Arabia is oil there on this campaign to try to divert guy and they go forth that they are the they are in an oil economy there are Petro state that is what they do\nUm so the first concern is hey you know if they wanted to they could potentially say look we're going to pull five six million barrels of oil off the you know off the market right now and potentially spike I don't know if that's necessarily what they end up doing\nWhy would they do it let's talk about what we ... if the if there's a conclusion that they murdered this journalist ... ... what what would our response we say well we're not going to say the armaments were or you know\nI don't know it could be you know that three hundred and fifty billion dollar arms deal could be something that's talked about there it could be financial sanctions that could be a whole bunch of different things the reason why this is really important okay and and this is not just looking at a water gas prices going to be over the next twelve months from\nSaudi Arabia for the last forty years has been the reason why the u._s. dollar has value ... okay the reason why is because back in Nineteen Seventy three after the Nixon shock back in Seventy one\nThe U.S went to Saudi Arabia and said hey look we want to make a deal where we are going to affect that we have the barrel or have a barrel of oil price in US dollars and that's going to be only way you can trade in Saudi Arabia because they were the world's largest producer one of the world's largest producers\nSaid yeah we we can get on board that gives us a guaranteed market for a product that gives us stability in the U.S said hey now people need to buy US dollars and that's why the dollar remains the world's reserve currency for the last forty years\nIf Saudi Arabia says gee we see where the puck is going and we see that China's going to all of a sudden be our biggest buyer over the next Twenty years now\nPlus you're saying you want to sanction us for something that we may or may not have done again I I don't know what happened I think it's likely the Saudi Arabia probably did something but here's the thing Turkey's not really someone you can trust either on\nWell and we treat like heat we do business with a lot of bad actors\nBut but here's this like turkey just two years ago ... went and murdered a whole bunch of journalists themselves also in jail the whole bunch of professors inner crackdown themselves so you're sitting there going okay\nI don't know like ... you're pretty much given me bad a or B ... what what do I choose Russia does the same thing exactly so there's a whole bunch of this now keep in mind the Russian model is this kind of the when you look at where you say gee we've sanction them for similar things you know you talk about like the Magnitsky Act and things like that\nThose are the exact kinds of things that this is built to deal with so I I I look at this and I say look if the U.S says hey we're going to sanction you were going to pull back from this Saudi Arabia might say you know what we're going to move away from the price of oil in dollars we're going to go in and find you know a a different trading\nPartner so it wasn't as in between a rock and a hard place isn't it yes he's he's damned if he does any damned if he does yes\nThere is no right answer on this ... and that's why no one wants to job of being president like this this this is something that no matter what the price aside is going to have big implications for where things go in the future because if he says look\nSaudi Arabia didn't do anything we're not going to do anything ... hey that pretty much gives them ... you want to go nuts what gives it gives Saudi Arabia carte blanche to go do whatever they want going\nWell they've been doing it they just have done it much more quietly in the past exactly they China does it does this turkey like not they don't make a list of the countries that partake\nA whole bunch of them but like this is just a blatant in your face thing and that's that's the difference I think in this case is for\nThis is one where turkey allegedly has added on videotape ... there's there's all kinds of measures they release that you know there there's one rumor that's going around that was from and and the reason that I stayed it even though it's you know somewhat of a rumor is because it's from bill Browder who was\nYou know very prominent in actually passing the Magnitsky Act\nUm who said look it was actually recorded from his I watch you know and like in that you have audio recordings that way so\nWho knows what's going on here but this has the potential to be a huge mess yeah well we can't overstate\nThis the are the issues that you should be concerned about folks is you turn your feet on this weekend most view a and oil trading at Seventy one dollars a barrel and the you know you're going to get a delivery of home heating oil some time and the next forty five sixty days what are you gonna be paying for it I don't know the answer to that\nHey when we come back we're take a topic

I'm Sorry it was about the pet thing is is very five to for the vet are at the fluffy [laughter]\nThere you go well the ah you know it is ah it it happens you know but everybody does it it said don't vote shuttle thing especially if you have like a you go you you take your Thirteen year old with you to the vet you try telling your Thirteen year old you're not gonna you know invest why you\nDon't get a dog when your kid is boring because if the exact situation that I outlined yes yes it's terrible it's terrible but yeah this this market here\nI think is going to show a lot of the same signs that we saw back in the spring where hey it's going to take a couple of months to get this back together and kind of figure out what things should be valued at going forward so I don't necessarily think that things are going to fall off the table right now but I think we've got a couple more months to some of some volatility\nBefore this thing comes down here so\nI got a few listeners chime in on the nurses ballot question nine seven eight says hospital professionals no better than the government neither nine seven eight says Barry no question one more government involvement is never good gotta agree with that\n[noise] ... this isn't even government involvement though well there's some individual involve like them this is you know direct democracy and I think that for things like this direct democracy\nIt's not the best tool because it's a complicated issue this this would be like you know if if you had a vote like ... you know what side of the road should we drive on\nHalf the people would say okay let's ... like ... it's just not something that you want people voting on I think\nYou guys follow the UPS story at all\n[noise] a little bit we didn't really a dig into it last week those drivers got screwed so what is he going to happen here on\nThis I don't know but ... should be taken out back and shot I mean this guy is the scum of the earth ... the heat\nThat the union votes fifty five percent of the membership says hey we do we reject this contract this is a bad deal we don't want it if you look at the New England numbers I looked at that the voting based on the regents truck\nIt was like eighty five percent of the New England chapter for the Teamsters said hey we're getting screwed do not accept this field\nAnd you know the fifty five percent was just on a the the members who voted over all on the UPS Freight contract which covered a narrower twenty thousand workers sixty three percent rejected that contract and yet it still ended up being ratified by union leadership here\nSo James Hoffa I think you're going to end up with a huge credibility problem for the union\nAnd this is the exact kind of thing if you talk about where you know populism tends to come from the kinds of things that we've seen over the last decade\nIt comes from things like this when the average person the person who is working every day feels that the people who are empowered to make decisions for them don't make decisions that actually give them what they want this is going to cause all kinds of\nProblems the one thing that the unions should be ashamed of and not the leadership that the members themselves the drivers the guy's handling the packages they didn't vote did he show up to vote no only about half of them voted and that's you know like you have no right to complain about your contractor who union when you don't even vote\nAnd that's why they were able to ratify this damn thing because they didn't get enough people who voted\nYeah pretty much that's ... that's really the exact reason why if you go through and take a look at the Teamsters constitution which I didn't know there was one button hey there's Teamsters constitution\nIt quote grants the Teamsters general president the power to implement a contract if less than fifty percent of the members vote on a contract that then requires a two thirds no vote to reject it supposed to be that that's the case only in a final offer\nA but it looks like that's what ended up happening here so even though this contract was a rejected pretty soundly by union membership that actually voted it was not enough to overcome the fact that the president could pretty much go through and say yeah we're going to push through anyway\nYou know the Amazon pays more than UPS\nFor entry level workers in these part time worker so if you're in this thing may end up settling itself just bail yeah wage pressure going to have guys UPS going to have a tough time hiring people for Thirteen bucks an hour when they can go across the street make Fifteen at Amazon or more I'm going to work at an Amazon warehouse\nI I'd be curious to see what you're going to be getting paid this winter to Amazon warehouse you'll see the ads ... I'm going to guess Eighteen to twenty bucks an hour in this region why do you think management push to ratify this management or man what was it in your\nUnion management why do you think union management pushed\nSo if you work in biotech there's a demand for your services especially if you happen to be a scientist\nYeah and the big thing that you're seeing is in order for these companies to try to retain talent obviously wages are moving up significantly but they're also throwing all kinds of perks people just try to keep them on board anything from gym memberships a you know uh you know the cafeterias on site that or you know high quality and this and that child\nCare you know all kinds of things\nThe big thing that people like that work for these biotech companies is the time off I talked to a gal\nAnd she's working at a you know it's a small biotech no money so they don't have the gym memberships and the other would they do is\nAt Christmas the weak Christmas they just shut down for the entire week a whole week now and they're going to do it now for the July Fourth week and it doesn't count towards your time off so you get your four weeks of vacation time plus your personal days or whatever [laughter]\nUm but you have two weeks it you know in the middle of the year at the end of the year where you get a full vacation week that you don't have to use your vacation that that if you're raising a family does a very valuable for\nAnd it it it's one of those things where if if you look at it there's a lot of industries where they can't do that anything customer service facing you can't do that can be financial services there can't do it but for something like this where all you're doing as a whole bunch of research you can coordinate research schedule you you get you can do that kind of thing so it's it's really interesting that these businesses\nAre kind of pushing the envelope as far as hey you know we can't necessarily pay people more will give you all kinds of different perks or they might still be able to offer significant benefit\nA lot of money pouring into that sector there as you look at their company\nYou know there'll be trading at three bucks and then a couple of weeks later they're trading at twenty dollars a share because they got some kind of after all it takes is like some kind of a drug approval of the opposite way too though that's the problem yeah oh they do ... you can make a lot of money enemy can lose an awful lot of money and you know\nSpeaking of which Medicare premiums are going up modestly next year unless you make a lot of money you see that if you make a lot of money your Medicare premiums are going to be over a thousand bucks a year\nYeah it's it's something where\nAre the part B premium so which this year have been\nA hundred and thirty four dollars ... ... a month they're going up to a hundred and thirty five fifty so it's only a modest it's a really small increase and I don't know what the reasons for that I don't know if they've been better at cracking down on fraud I don't know if they've found you know better reimbursement rates to keep prices down\nBut that is a really small increase for Medicare premiums and what that means is that people who are getting Social Security bumps meaning everyone who gets that two point eight percent bump on Social Security so what's that work out to about forty bucks a month yeah we're going to be able to keep most of that now\nWhat is being because there there have been so many years where either people have gotten no bump for Social Security or it's been all eaten up by increases in Medicare premiums\nAnd this is really good ... again\nYou know let's put it this way though Chuck if you're living on your Social Security you're working as well you you you're not living you can't pay your bills in New England and live on the air whether you're eighty or you get New England\nBut there's lots of parts of the country where people live on is their Social Security there's people in New England to do it to you know they're not easy they're not living inside one twenty eight is my guess\nNow they're living in subsidized housing [noise]\nNo you you can live if you look if you're out and you know uh Lancaster or something like that you can you can live cheaply out there you know it's it's just we get so focused on okay here's what things cost in the city there's a whole bunch of people don't live anywhere near city\nSo you get a modest increase in your Medicare part B in a pretty good bump in your Social Security and other bumping Social Security left in the January check\nIs going to be a I Believe so yes it's and so they they pretty much tell you right now just so that you can plan for it um but that is going to be starting in twenty Nineteen so in January\nAnd just as an added bonus here a sixty five year old American male in two thousand and Eighteen\nIs expected to live another Nineteen point two years I start to see the older you get the more you start focusing in on the SAT so yeah if a if a sixty five year old has another Nineteen years I figure I must have another twenty twenty five [laughter]\nThat means that if you make it to sixty five pretty good chance you're making it to eighty four\nThe problem is binary you either do or you don't when there's no middle ground you know you can't get halfway gets it you either do or you don't you know it's not like oh I get to Seventy five in it you're done then\nThere is it how about women sixty five year old American female in twenty eight teams gets an extra Twenty one point six years\nIn eighty six point six years old and\nYou know what we've seen over the last forty years as this uh outlines here is that life expectancy is particular for those who are older have increased somewhat here a lot of the gains that we've picked up in life expectancy over the twentieth century or primarily due to improved\nA medical care around the first few years of life you know it used to be you know if you go back to the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds\nPretty good chance of dying and your first five years of life you know it was pretty common and that's part of the reason why people at such big families pay they knew a couple of working to make it\nWhat you see now is we're starting to get better at improving quality of life for older folks and so you are seeing longer life expectancy is even if you're already in your fifties sixties and seventies\nWell that ah you know the it's all good news but managing the strain that's going to put on Medicare and Social Security ... which they weren't calculated to live you know when they these programs are designed you're supposed to be dead by the time you're Seventy five\nMost times you were you know is it just ... they're not built to last in a world where people retire in their sixties and then a retired for twenty to twenty five years they will nobody's talking about fixing them or are there no no one wants to\nBe ah our generation ... our our generation is just saying\nYeah we'll let the millennials handle that one of the doubt still hanging on to modest gain the Dallas up two points ... fifty six points and we get you a price on oils are just too says the barrel or Seventy one thirty six\nAnd the ten year treasuries at three fifty and that's not that back three Fifteen on the stand your treasury call me when it's four and a half and I'll get a limo we'll be right back with more financial [noise] station [noise]\nJust Saudi Arabia murder they're missing journalist believed dead I'm Dave Anthony Fox News the world\nAnd your fear is that they'll buy less schooling for\nThey already have okay trying to stay that way back since ... fourteen foreign buyers have been ... neutral as far as what they've been buying there and so the question then is if you have rates going up meaning that the the the treasury is going to have to pay more on the bonds that issues at auction\nAid that extra interest is going to eat into the federal budget which means we then have to borrow more or cut other programs for it and so you end up with this crowding out scenario because you don't have foreign buyers to sterilize the U.S debt anymore\nAnd you potentially end up with some nasty situations as a result of that it's not something that is guaranteed to happen because hey maybe things get cleared up internationally and all of a sudden China says yep we're happy to buy treasury is again I don't think that's happening now doesn't see I don't think that's happening China sees an existential threat to being tied to the dollar and they want to move away from it\nYou still love chick fillet\nSet a question to answer that question to tell you I never been we've been over this I don't have any near me a minute drive twenty five miles to go to one you should you should I was your age your life I was looked at noon every I was looking at chick fillet and I said to myself why would somebody\nBy a McDonald's franchise as opposed to a chick fillet or why would somebody by a subway franchise I guess subway franchise is more expensive to buy\nThan a chick fillet franchise you can get a sense you can get a chick fillet franchise for like twenty grant\nBut you know what there's twenty thousand apple gifts it's harder to get into Harvard it's it's unbelievable twenty thousand people apply to buy a chick flick a you know how many they give out a little less than a hundred yeah so it's something going on\nYou have a less than half a percent chance of actually being approved to to buy one of these franchise\nSo they're looking for somebody that they can mold and they they also don't sell you you can't say well I Want to buy all the chick fillet franchises in New England for all the trick for you know you can buy\nOne on unlike McDonald's which now is looking for people to buy more than one McDonalds if you go on their website and take a look at their franchise got their franchisee guidelines they want people who can by five ten Fifteen twenty they want\nWith obviously you're not operating them great like chick fillet saying yeah we'll let you in the door for twenty grand yep right but you have to be there every day you've got to hire the people you've got to make sure grease the customer like if you own a chick fillet franchise it's not you're not operating it from the sea sweet no on the floor\nThey want you to be active but one of the key things is when you go through a what they detail that they want\nOne of the biggest things they don't want you have any other active business ventures I Want you to be all in on this franchise and I'll tell you one of the you know I talk about how good the food is a ... again I I Love the Chicken Little just something about like I Love the chicken\nThis customer service that I have gotten there not only is better than any other fast food restaurant I've seen\nIt rivals some actual you know sit down dining establishment in terms of the overall quality that you get you get managers were literally managers walking around picking up trash saying hey can I get you anything do you need ice and that you get people coming up to help you more often than I've ever seen and I think\nWhen I talk about you know the chick flick experienced and why I think it's better the food's one thing but customer service is something that's been largely left out of the last Twenty years just about everywhere because it all gets sent you know to think about any customer service ... you've had whether it's with ... whether it's ... whoever it is it's generally not good\nI don't I I'm going to disagree with you there you go to an American restaurant\nAnd you are generally going to get\nPretty good service for I guess we came back we were in Paris for a week you want to talk about bad service try visiting Paris ... what was bad about it maybe they knew you were American\n... well maybe not about it ... the the waiter so they don't get much in the way it tips right so they make you know Fifteen twenty euros an hour\nBut because people don't tip for reasons don't tip\nThey the you get just God awful survey\nWhat was that was a slow did they not bring the rate like\nWhat we actually had added on it usually just slow it wasn't like the a lot of times people say oh the French air and they weren't they were very nice but it was just like you you could go literally twenty minutes with your Empty Plates and then you're in front of you and I when I'm done my meal I Want my plate gone I think part of that just is a cultural difference\nI I was just about to say that check I think in America everything's fast paced and get in get out and over there are just way more\nLaid back I Want you to spend like two or three hours eating\nRight no well I I Would I Would take American service over a European\nAnd I think to today's the day boys by the way I just Google a chick fillet near me in this one in debt um which I was not aware of oh which is right on the way home so you're going to go and I think I might\nBut they they if that answers the question is why\nPeople don't buy ... how much does a manager make if you if you buy one of these franchises what kind of money going to make are we talking a manager or the ... or the ... you will you go out ... like really you're only paying twenty grand to get the franchise so really what they're doing is they're hiring managers\nYou're you're buying the opportunity to be a manager for ... for a chick\nFillet so I can do some research okay based on what I'm finding initially okay this is a from someone I found this on line this from someone who is a former marketing director at chick fillet\nUm but it looks like if you talk about the based revenue that you get plus some profit sharing also forced it looks like the low end is about a hundred thousand a year or the high end is well north of three fifty so my guess is most people\nAre probably between two hundred and three hundred a year when it's all said and done a good living and go early and and you don't have to work Sundays [noise]\nNo and and I wonder if you get free chick fillet oh I'm would let me tell you that there's some value to that signed me up\nHey when we come back we're going to be

it was for Mississippi all the other states would you know have to be embarrassed but Mississippi always has the worst economy in the ... what what state\nMississippi where they said Mississippi the city I might not have to go back and I I\nHave I made a big known that\nThey have a kind of me in New England is Maine\nI have a good buddy of mine from a Alabama ... who I was talking to him over the weekend he went down to Mississippi or over to Mississippi for a wedding\nAnd he said for everyone who ever makes fun of Alabama have them go to Mississippi and they won't make fun of Alabama and these are his exact words um but yeah so you take a look at these are these numbers here um what what stood out to you most overall in terms of some of these trends\nLike I just look at wages in like in Maine the average weekly wage is eight hundred and ten bucks a week how do you live on eight hundred and ten bucks a week even if your housing is an expensive yeah I I think it\nIs again it is different when you're in different parts of the country and you can if you take a look at some of these areas Indiana just used as an example\nYou know Indiana their wage growth is slowly one point two percent\nUm but it's a really cheap place to live actually like right you can live off of you know twenty five thirty grand a year pretty comfortably and a lot of ... or low property taxes property taxes are low you're overall expenses are low 'cause a lot of the food is grown relatively close by they don't ship it long distances\nYou know things like that make a big difference there but in terms of the overall economy is that you see here\nWhat stands out to me and you talk about this an awful lot it's education yeah you know education makes a big difference you're talking Washington state Colorado\nThese the Utah Texas Massachusetts Virginia Iowa those your top ten they'll either have really good public universities or really good private universities in them so they don't ... it really does make a big difference there when it's all said and done\nBut I look at Vermont and New Hampshire a pretty good at it education infrastructure and they're kind of these aren't good I think\nPart of that is so education I think is a big piece there um but in those cases I think it's just size and scale you know they just can't get to the overall size\n'em in critical mass in those places you know Vermont's got the second smallest population in the country\nUm and and I think that plays in their Florida you've got a good economy you have your ... growing at two and a half percent yup eleventh best in the country and again you talked about really good education University of Miami one of the best schools in the country\nYou know they've got some obviously state schools are good or state schools are pretty good they've ... they've gotten better they didn't used to be great but they've got to get out of Haitian systems terrible but again on the private side they've got some good private universe no\n... I'm Talking about your grammar school though like if you live in a in Boca you're not sending your kid to public\nSchool no so I I think in general it's its its size and education and kind of are the two pieces that you need in order to kind of get things moving\nOr Netflix with the ... what's the problem and Netflix they laid an egg [noise]\nWell they they did in that they didn't grow at the rate that people were expecting that came in with five point five one million new subscribers in second quarter this is what we found back in\nUh when they reported earnings last quarter that was down from seven point for when the previous quarter and below six point two million that they had guided to in April the big thing is Netflix is a growth company okay and when you buy a gross company you're not buying the cash flow that they have the day you're buying the potential cash flow they might have tomorrow you know\nAnd the issue with that is if they miss numbers like this the stock does get punished this stock went from for Nineteen to share in July down to three sixteen in mid August it's round three twenty four share today so it's off about twenty five percent almost twenty five percent from its highest here\nHas to do with all the competition coming into the space you know Eighteen tease getting into the business Disney's getting into the business Amazon is coming out with more and more product that I find washable\nSo Carly Wal Mart has now too [laughter]\nYeah yeah we we did but I I actually ... have you heard of people it do you have friends that have canceled their Netflix saw yeah yeah but they've eventually come back around on Netflix my son Michael cancelled this he said really we just were watching yeah does he have anything\nTo get others ... services I'm sure he said yeah yeah I I canceled my net for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Worcester", "day": "15"}
