[noise]\nPlease join us next time for music and the spoken word until we meet again\nMake peace be with you this day and always\nOh [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nOh [noise]\n\nWhen do you what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after easy cash John who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower which spot in trouble before it happened when I was telling us to protect our home and family break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crooks\nYou can also download our podcast and you can click on the asked Todd tab where you can submit your question to taught to read on the air and hopefully his answer will stop you from being one of his next real life stories\nTodd we also talk about how important it is for people to actually fund\nTheir trust so I Know with cars you can do and you guys make sure that all the real estate's included that in the real estate is transferred into the trust\nIf we're working together with mutual client we make sure that all those liquid assets get in but for those who are out there many attorneys do not transfer there are real estate in for them so how do you actually transfer real estate\nFrom your own names into your ear evil will trust\nOkay so we're talking about this irrevocably type yes right although it's not entirely different if you had to revoke ... trust so I just thought I'd throw that out there it's it's really the same so the deed work we prepare because we can do that so we prepare new deeds that actually say you know\nTodd blood ski here by transfers and conveys too you know Billy trustee of a\nTodd lucky family or a vocal trust who says right on your feet you guys will know that because you can go look at your real estate tax bill and see that it comes in the name of the trust and not to the LA\nWell it might an individual right you'll get scared 'cause you'll see his name it'll probably say Billie trustee and you'll say oh how come it's in Belize name it's night Billy trustee\nOf the drums sometimes they can't fit the whole trust name on there so you might just see Billy as trustee that means that title has been changed and it's now owned by the irrevocably trust good\nBut banking investment accounts same thing you need to actually go to the so like for you to go to a financial advisor chairs and you get forms\nAnd you fill out the forms that actually say I'm you know\nTrade changing title to the account to read the maybe Todd let's keep family irrevocably ...\nPut your name and and then it's in there and you also know what's in their cars you will need a separate tax id number right or the irrevocably trust what you would not need for the ... a couple of trust\nYou just use your social but you still need to change their name and that's really how you do is make sure you look at your statements that you get and make sure they come in the name of the trust under the new id number then you know they're in there\nAnd sometimes when you are putting real estate in there you know it can take a couple of months even though that deeds been recorded it can take ... he's a couple of months for you to see that change reflected on your your ... your tax bill and so forth so don't panic if you don't see that\nSo once you actually put your home in your area vocal trust taught him for a lot of people that's their biggest asset is there anything that you can no longer to do with your home\nIf it's owned by the trucks are given up any rights to anything\nI Would say the only thing you cannot do\nWould be re mortgage it okay now you can keep existing mortgages first of all most people that are doing Medicaid planning don't have a more they're not concerned but ... but ... and yeah and getting a new third year mortgages not high on there to do list mhm so\nProbably not an issue but some people still have the lingering mortgage that has been very good at home equity line of credit for home on the line of credit what we do generally is we reserve a life a states this will be one of the times where we actually would reserve the life of state\nIn the deed by doing that you now preserve the mortgage\nMeaning they won't trigger the due on sale clause you didn't give it away remember we're not giving anything away we're keeping that President right to live there the rest of our lives which is what a life of status mhm\nAnd that means that you have not triggered the due on sale clause so you can keep that existing line of credit or existing mortgage you just can't get a new one\nWithout taking it out of the trust once and it is and restarting the clock sweet and then you could get it but you would have to restart\nThe clock so you so if someone doesn't have a balance due to a bank or they don't have a mortgage or they don't have a line of credit would you recommend that they establish a line of credit before they transferred and knowing that they're not going to be able to\nGet one after isn't you know what are your thoughts kind of a personal matter it really matters up to the client you know what do they feel you guys feel like you need that security of being able to borrow money in the future 'cause if you keep the line of credit you can always write the check\nTo borrow up to the limit that your cats because you can use it you can you again way line immigrants just can't get a new one right now you can keep the one you have up to the credit limit that they gave you and the term than they gave you because you preserve that in the life of state so\nOh it's really a family matter if you feel that you need that comfort level to say oh my gosh if I Need a new hot water heater I Need a new roof or I Need something that causes a lot of money and I don't have it otherwise\nThan yeah OK otherwise mostly no\nOkay you know it's there's a lot of questions that might be going through your mind at All right well what else can I Do when my house is and then tries can sell it can I can I I'm Still have to pay my taxes and get the right off for that can and put rental property in there what else can I Do and how did these trust work\nEveryday Todd's guy that is written for the month of October it's designing

everything that we live they blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan or that\nKind of a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Dave in Boston mass and Dave writes I Am the trustee of my mother's eerie vocal trust the trust has been in for since two thousand and nine and has two properties in it\nShe has a number of CDs now can I put those in the same trust if so would this adversely affect the trust and if it is not adversely affected\nHow when with these CDs be protected would there be a five year clock started for the CDs or would they immediately be protected using that trust original two thousand and nine start date\nDays looking for a loop I don't care I'm Wondering if you ask\nJust a few more questions 'cause there was only about Fifteen pounds\nOr my own heart here he's looking for a long you're going to back to you\nKnow there's no loophole here for your body but I Do have good news for your overall depending on how old you are I'm In and this is really the question right so he so I'm Sorry how old your mother is to have 'em\nAnd and so this becomes a question for all of you when you're doing you're planning and this is why why when we do planning for people we put as much assets as we can in the trust\nAll at one time that being said it doesn't mean you can't add to the trust later if you want to so you got to see deep question here Dave and we certainly can add to the trust later\nBut I'm going to explain the ramifications so depending on mom's age hopefully you put everything and you want it in at one time then you have one five you're waiting period running on the whole thing mhm let's say mom put it in at sixty five\nAnd now she's Seventy and everything she initially put in which is what the two the two properties yet right those are all protected\nSometimes they're not comfortable learning about how the trust really doesn't cause of many problems at all and then after this five years went by and they say you know and then I kind of forgot all about the trust it's not hurting me at all not changing my life at all mhm\nMaybe I'll take some of these CDs and put 'em in there well in my hypothetical for your mother in this case Dave she's now Seventy\nCatch you put the season yes you can will create a new five you're waiting period for her yes it will\nBut only on the new addition that new money so at least you can rest assured that the two houses are protected\nAnd you'd only have to deal with mhm perhaps undoing are dealing with that money that you put in if something happens in the next five years but now you have to get to Seventy five right\nProvided the increase provided that had an increased the waiting period between the time you contributed your house\nAnd the time you contribute CDs so the answer is yes you can do five o'clock so think about how old you are when you start this right 'cause they did this planting ten years ago run mom while ago so it was Seventy\nAt the time ...\nIt's a little harder to undo doesn't mean you don't do it no I think you're still step back and look at her health and say you know well she's in pretty good shape let's let's get another clock started do it\nSo what do you do Todd if Dave puts the CDs and they're now in four years down the road mom goes into their thing and they don't make that five years\nThat's a great question I Would have to decide by looking at and this is where last minute planning comes into play right\nI normally there's things left out of the trust look at this case the for example she lost a lot of money out of the trust all or CDs it and go and\nI'm sure even though she's putting the CDs and now Dave that she left out of the trust her IRA money and any other money that she just didn't feel comfortable putting in yet mhm\nLet's look at how much that is if she left about a hundred grand outside the trust\nAnd were four years into this new five year waiting period I'm likely to tell or the mother in this case or Dave if the mom's going in the nursing home\nLet's private pay with the money you have outside the trust mhm why it's at risk anyway and if I spend a hundred grand to protect all I don't know another five hundred thousand of CDs that I put in the trust I'm OK doing that\nAnd that will get us past that one more year waiting period that we need to get to ... to protect it all otherwise\nNone of that five hundred thousand is protected so think of it as being pro rated in the sense that yeah I've got four years under my belt even those zero of those dollars is protected yet\nI'll pay for a year mhm just to protect the balance of the money that's in there so lots of options get the clock running never a bad idea yeah\nAnd you know what folks ideally you're going to do your planning in advance\nEducate yourself before you start the process so you know what should and should not being your trust and how these trust operate on a day to day basis\nTodd's

answer on the air our next question comes from Donna in Newbury port ... writes\nI Am single I have two kids and three grandkids and leaving my assets equally to all five of them\nI have an ... trust that holds my home should I named my ear evoke about trust as beneficiary of my IRA what are the pros and cons of this\nSo if it's an ear replicable trust\nI I'm for I think we need to figure out what size of the IRA meaning what percentage of the IRA makes up mhm the trust or makes up the entire state I think with Iraq a couple trust\nNot replicable replicable as a whole different animal but was irrevocably trust well\nWith a ... couple of trust you could name the designated beneficiary of the IRA such trust them with a replicable trust\nI worry a little that the language I have to put in there in the trust to allow the IRA to be a beneficiary\nAnd the way the states are scrutinizing every application for Medicaid and trying to find ways to poke holes into these trust that somehow they
