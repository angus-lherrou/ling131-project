Christmas season remember last year was no day at the beach true you had problems they're going to sell thirty to forty percent more stuff this Christmas and they did last course yes yep they need workers yup this this\nWorkers for the first time Johnson's what Nineteen Ninety nine\nHave the upper hand absolute was the last time workers a guy you remember what the job market was like Ninety nine I was like you you had to give signing bonuses in order to hire a receptionist\nAnd the downside of this as we do see it reflected in the quality of help that some a lower paying businesses are having to get my indicator has always been and this has been true for thirty forty years every single time it's worth\nThe quality of the help I get going through the drive through at McDonalds tells me everything I Need to know about the economy John maybe you should be better than McDonalds Roger a little [laughter] perhaps but I have found that in boom times\nYou wait forever they get the order wrong yep right but I'll tell you something in two thousand nine I got better treatment that a five star restaurant and you know again I I don't mean to make a judgment on that it's just a really interesting anecdotal indicator\nIt sure is [laughter] were you ah were you caught by surprise but the G announcement yeah that was a surprise I was glad it happened I did have a you know I hate to speak ill of the departed but a John ... sucked\nHe he just ... and you know why he got fired was for my criticism of the reasons I my criticism of flattery was\nIn February or march whenever it was he came out and said well I didn't understand that we owed all this money for a long term care insurance policies that we sold back in the nineties and we have to write down another twenty billion or something where I was furious whereas I bought the stock in November and I thought OK I'll bite in November\nI got a new CEO the stock when the Sunni came in and went from like thirty bucks down to Seventeen I said that's got to be the bottom\nRight like catching a sort of feel like somebody dropped the sword from the Empire State building and I tried to catch the damn thing well that's the thing if you you didn't you didn't buy trucks theory in my theory that whether a cock roaches there were more cockroach I did not you did [laughter] I tested the c._e._o. CEO remember\nYou know and this is why I wanted flattery fired back in February I said\nHey he told us that everything he in every city Odessa is right as soon as you get in office you blame everything predecessor and and you flush all the bad news he did that in November and then he goes well I've made a mistake and then last week he goes to the board and says well\nYou know I forgot about the power division and hail another twenty three billionaire the Port Said screw I ... the the the board was furious\nI think you're right I mean the bottom line is that if we can defend flattery the argument here is that he was too deliberative\nThat's a a a generous way of describing what you've just described and so he was deliberative he's been slow and executing the plan yeah he's been slow into vested in some of the industries and businesses that they want to get out of\nThe restructuring is behind plans now the argument in his defense is that he's talking about literally restructuring an entire large company and he wants to be carefully gets it right and he wants to ... and he's a deliberative guy by nature\nThe boards feels like they need someone to step in take charge and the stuff that he wanted to do we need to do yesterday you know so the argument for GE is whatever their plan is it's rolling into high gear ASAP and if you look at the track record of Larry cope yeah let's talk about ... comes over\nEat the he actually took a seat on the board of directors in April maybe was earlier this year okay even his record at Dana her is amazing isn't it a he was fourteen years CEO I looked at a stock chart bury it was literally a straight line up with no tips for fourteen straight years\nUh he increased the value of that company from\nNine point seven billion we took over to fifty billion dollars when he left in fourteen years she uh she's run one of the largest science and technology conglomerates in the world\nAnd he did an unbelievable job I the further away left in her that's exactly my point is this guy is only like in his mid fifties I fifty five fifty five years old and he has a track\nRecord that would make any CEO jealous\nOr why he was immediately available and why he was a stupid Dana hers is only mustered out and board that's the only thing he can attributed to ready done it in there done that you know and he sees this as an opportunity to do something really big I mean this is a great historic American name and General Electric my only criticism is is that he teaches\nAt Harvard [laughter] you won't get that I bet he doesn't teach there anymore [laughter] but Larry ... yeah no I think he's he's got a real job now ah and he has an unbelievable track record and investors are definitely viewing this favorably well so\nLet's talk about that are BC raise their price targets fifty but to ... over a J. P. Morgan still hasn't at ten [noise] wow yeah I mean ah maybe there's more cockroaches fly in the stock\nI actually own some ya I sold mine yeah well you did I go to a bit the bullet and I ...

much that you\nAs Wall Street watch presented by leader bank leader bank as wide selection of gold and silver bullion coins available at all their locations called leader bank at eight seven seven six nine one Seventy nine hundred for more information you know ...\nI I actually you'll love it I I owned a stock and I sold it when it got up to like forty five I said this is not yet but they have a heck of a business model they like you you they sell you colds and and the markup on clothing John ... is like\nYeah oh Newt you you you measure it in multiple right right I get these they sent me I don't know two hundred dollars of clothes and that's about the average price of your boxer close your eyes get five or six items and you you spend I don't know two two hundred and fifty bucks\nOn those items minutes you know shirts pants that uh might be socks or any any number of different items\nBut they they fit perfect uh they've their lifestyle is because you get your own personal stylist right right so I have my own personal stylist and and I feed back with my stylist and they tell them what colors I like what kind of factions I live on ... and things like that\nAnd then they send you a box of clothes that fit and your wife doesn't [laughter] 'cause that was that was my motivation I my wife was giving me crap all the time I looked like a bomb everything you have has writing on it yet [laughter] you have a clean T shirt at least I mean\nNow now I get I I don't have to worry and she likes the stuff I by how is the value of that I mean I I assume meant past really wants to go to the store is how do they make money doing that because they end up paying to send it out to eat right as I said yeah but but John they like the the thing is\nLike the mark up on the clothes they have those stores to operate right right so they just send me close so they I I spent two three hundred bucks on the clothes every two months and\nWhat does it cost them twenty bucks maybe dirty yeah in terms of actually the cost of the clothing now they've ... they've technology costs and things like that the clothing the mark up\nLike if you look at a pair of sneakers might cost new balance a dollar twenty to make those sneakers and they sold us for Seventy five bucks yeah same thing with close right blue jeans shirts\nThe markup that shirt you're wearing now's probably like a what a sixty Seventy dollars ... you're probably cost like a dollar twenty to make okay but I get that but stitch fixes to I'm a middle man so to speak\nAnd they can't get the shirt for a dollar for they they don't pay much were they really yeah you look it up algae either look at their balance ... there were they're spending their money is on client acquisition and so you might look at it and say well this is just another ...\nThey they don't have the turn right see that's what I thought you know they they don't have as bad as churn rate as your blue apron because people are lazy\nRight I I'm lazy I I I don't want to get like now I have my clothing my casual clothing is his history I don't have to worry about it and I'm so you're you're saying that that let's say it's a fifty dollar shirt you get that fits perfectly that you love\n'em you're saying that they can get that shirt for dirt cheap oh yeah they're paying maybe I'll bet you they're markup\nIs at least ten times so the jeans they sell me for fifty bucks probably cost them five because they're not but where are they getting the genes I they are they going to wrangler in saying we're going to give you all know name it's always you know these are like big name no there's there's no brand names on any of this stuff really yeah\nYeah it's all it's high quality well if they're actually a better quality and then I then I thought oh they are talking what do you try Tucker didn't like it a lot of his\n... white wedding you liked because my style is could not have been more off with whatever question okay well that you see that that's probably your fault you know wasn't yet don't you don't have to spend time with your stylist\nLike I I spent time with your science Internet they send you a a a an email and you click through different colors they like you know and I did a styles of clothes that you might like might not allowed to do and then when they send you stuff\nRemember it's quick it's easy it's the law\nWhy after

Ninety four point nine FM double duty AG\nVote on our daily full question had financial exchange show John come while you're there fire up the media player and watch the show while your base to the financial exchange radio network on\nHow we talked about a product to reduce triglycerides last week and say we're going to look at the company stock of the company that actually makes that product\nJoe McCann from seeking alpha joined just Joe thanks for joining us this morning\nIt's going to be on again\nYeah joke about the company and this fish oil capsule what it's all about\nYeah so am rent the company has one drug crew coke and the type of purified fish oil they've had this drug on the market in two thousand\nTwelve and really there was a big debate around whether or not it actually how people live longer than a heart attack like great so we knew that it lowered triglycerides a patient particularly\nLet them very high ... whether that mattered in terms of your life than it was really worth the time and money to do it was something that was up for debate until recently\nThat's interesting I I've dealt with high triglycerides myself and I know people who also deal with it and I was under the presumption that triglycerides were even a bigger problem in cholesterol but you're saying that was not a Scientifically Proven\nThat hypothesis and so you know a lot of these drugs\nAnd a ... an intervention ... think about\nYou know hey it probably is a problem it looks like we have no animal model like that but until you do with this company did which the eight thousand person study over it took seven years to get it finished but over a long period of time and actually measured the number of heart attack the number of deaths the number of\nIssues along those lines go into the hospital you don't know for sure so it could be that you know the body compensate cholesterol not really that bad and so this this study that really took a very hard look at it with real an aunt that people care about obviously\nGoing back to kill you\nExiting that Cameron stock as reported took off it tripled in a very short period of time but this is not exactly a diversified company hammer and this is the Raleigh product right [noise]\nYes there are only product and they think that was holding back to talk for a long time I mean to give you a little bit of the legacy your fish oil a lot of people debated how innovative it was the company spent a lotta years getting bound you around this product and we don't need to get into all that but they did it\nAnd then there's this this trial hanging over head where you know what if it didn't work with anyone get treated for it so maybe the drug doesn't go away but becomes extremely mentioned small and you know\nRather than having the central you'd market open to them now it could have been off the coast\nSo we've learned that triglycerides are in fact a potential real problem for people in terms of cardiovascular risk and we've learned that fish oil can help that situation right so it's a kind of a two prong thing that we've kind of cross the border on\nYeah and I'm a second round up tell you you're one of the reasons people were very skeptical that other show how to fail a trial is similar type of thing and people have their doubts about the argument has always been in this goes back to the the argument and a lot of the\nRationale for the drug that you know there's a purified form a certain type called ETA and that that is really concentrated on the show you're taking and it's really pure than it had a different impact on on survival and and\nBenefit for the patient and said this was really testing that hypothesis that this is the one right type of intervention that works not just you know when you go to CBS in get or even this other ... that was done recently generic so this trip hitting it really surprises in a lot of people I mean that's part of life of the huge duck a\nJoke do do you like the stock it's a small stock or what are your thoughts about the stock Emery\nYeah some before this came out I had actually done some work my company is going shopping and what we do is we interviewed doctors to talk about you but the science of being done and the potential in the market so it's been shall we did this call with a leading cardiologist summer than we already what age you think it's going to work and be if it does how would you use it\nWhat we found that really the market is enormous for this and the fact that they get you can point such tangible benefits for patients is really no telling us that the\nYou know the sky's the limit kind of your the number of American but a lot of people all over the world who have this issue Germans can even if you're honest on you know you're going to need more intervention is really a huge upside\nA lot of time thank you very much John McCain from seeking alpha great a great story you know when we reported that a little over a

gay or nay\nThe government basically said look we'll let you off the hook up if you just do this this\nSlap on the wrist and he turned it down and I thought to myself that's crazy then I thought to myself and I want to ask you this question\nI think he lawn mosque realizes that we need a lawn mosque more than he needs us if you're the U.S government\nYou can piggyback your space program right on the back of a guy named ... you don't need to be spending a couple trillion dollars in space exploration you could say Iran\nCan we go along for the ride right okay do we want you on mosques to seek

their five hundred million if we lost space sex hustler you don't want to lose ... national security right I think he's I I actually get the guy credit I think he realizes\nThe government needs him more than he needs the government and oh by the way one of the government do after the stock got slaughtered\nIn Moscow like well it's too bad government came back and said you know what we can make this work [laughter]\nI Know you said no deal but let's kind of get let's let's make this work I think we need them more than he needs\nUs Fed's an interesting theory they ah ten things to know about the NAFTA deal going to tell you the a lot of a noise is being made over this deal and then I looked at the damn thing not much different I said it's\nNothing like it we went from having access to two point eight five percent of Canada's dairy market up to three point one five short directly like we still don't have access to the dairy market\nUm and they're actually kind of mad that they have to give up like zero point five oh yeah we're giving into trouble like watch the uh the one thing that that's actually pretty good in there I think is especially from a national security standpoint is our cars now have to have Seventy five percent of their parts\nIn North America and that's going to be phased in over five years but I Do like the idea is there are certain things that I think we too there's too many places where we've um\nExtended and an offshore on reduction that are dangerous I'll give an example um your your kids ever have strep throat when they're oh yeah you know all that stuff comes from\nChina really now while I did not know that so imagine you know like ... where to trade war with China you're right you do we really want to get into like\nWe we don't make any of that stuff for rabies and incorrect so yeah that's that's a whole separate issue and it's very important Seventy I you know you're talking about the fact Seventy five percent of auto components must be built in North America\nRight now the requirement of sixty two and a half percent right so that's uh that I looked at as being pretty significant I I I Would say the President Trump okay that's a that's a when I put that in the ... it's incremental and it's really it's incremental even that it's phased in over five years\nDoes it also tell you how big a business dairy is though that there was this much squabbling about that yeah and both sides are saying wow this is a really big deal\nApparently Barry is a pretty big business yup well of course we need it or not every day or use it every day yeah cheese you know ... dream yeah exactly you know I mean there is a big deal\nUm and we made some progress in that so that's good yeah I I thought another issue that kind of I didn't think it was that big a deal but apparently is is that forty five percent of workers\nMust make sixteen dollars an hour or more that struck me as very honor is pay but it's a big deal in Mexico\nTrue that's that's where in John has\nThe Mexican workers in it you know like maybe Canada in the U.S everybody's making over sixty right but in Mexico everybody's making five true and I wonder if that does something to quell\nBasically the civil war than going on in Mexico may Mexico you're talking about a violent place like don't go there on vacation yeah just don't\nBut I also wonder if Mexico would be that affected by it because if we\nCount all the workers in Canada and we count all the workers in the United states and then we add they have huge factories in next true\nAnd also just yeah at the at the margin this could keep a lot of jobs from going down there in the future I think that's the big concern yeah I think from Mexico's perspective they they they're they're looking at it and say the the one thing that I'll mention though ... average price of a new car\nOver thirty six thousand bucks now yeah and that brings us back to ... this is a NAFTA deal that we negotiated is going to make cars it won't be long before the average price of the new vehicles forty forty five thousand bucks and no one's going to buy him that well they're not buying them now I Know like if you look now\nEvery every like my next car is going to be used vehicle yeah I'm just not going to spend that kind of do on a new car well that's spread between the new car and the high quality used cars\nIs now a very very substantial spread and it's it's moved a lot of people to the used car market particularly with some of these really high quality leases were low mileage and and and low miles\nNext topic that we're going to talk about is is um China and how they systematically pride technology from U.S companies I saw this story\nI guess it was last week I saw it but we're going to be joined by Bob Davis\nAnd Bob is going to explain to us what China what kind of pressure China exerts on American companies that want to do business in China Starbucks comes to mind you're a big company that does a lot of business in China they basically\nUh they've got 'em over a barrel we'll talk about that with Bob Davis Wall Street journal next on the financial exchange\nHave a question for burying
