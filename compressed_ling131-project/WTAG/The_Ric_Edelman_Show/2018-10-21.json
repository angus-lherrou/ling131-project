{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Asking a specific donor for money to promote a and support an educational program and they specific school a cluster of schools\nThat's where the money goes exclusively entirely\nThrough our special events fundraising ah which um you know would be I keep in mind open gala for example\nUm many of those dollars support our um staff salaries into overhead but we also get a significant amount of funding again we talked earlier about um stability back in the role it played in the evolution and creation of the shining issued if\nThey provide us with significant funding every year which covers most of the overhead so\nThe general fund raising that we do throughout the year we're able to apply almost all of that back into programs and services\nAnd are you able to bring your program into public schools we are\nNow many if any public schools throughout central Massachusetts um we started a five years ago being invited by a private school in North central Massachusetts or to speak to students and we did and from there it just\nSort of steam or old gathered momentum we now have collaborated with a close to three dozen public and private schools and school systems throughout central Massachusetts and just the last five years\nDo the schools reach out to you or do you have to go find schools that want to invite you in their classrooms to talk to their students\nYeah early on um it was a painstaking approach to develop for poor and confidence with school administrators because this is the type of subject that oftentimes a suggests that gee what if a student or someone in our school a begins to ask questions about suicide for example ah we don't want to go there\nA but once we gained that confidence uh and we had the endorsement of school administrators um than other schools began reaching out to Washington now almost exclusively it's from a school so we we um we get that contact in that invitation which is remarkable saw\nVirtually every school administrator told me that we have met with in the last five years have now recognized as social emotional growth and health of their students is as important if not more so than the academics\nAnd when people reach out to the shine initiative um is there a fee like do I do I contact you via your website or phone and say hey I got some questions I'd like to come in and see you how how does that process happen\nOr in response to question number one we are and that's what makes us generally quite appealing to school systems is that we have never charged to the for any of the programs are services that we provide [noise] um [noise]\nYou know that may change down the road ah but for now we're proud that we're able to do that and yes uh schools can reach out to us administrators and students oftentimes will reach out to us\nThrough a simple email or phone call by going to our website or they may attend a conference reform at which we present and a school administrator in the audience a student in the audience will step up and say gee you know we'd like to bring this to our school how can we develop a student loans devise your team and our school\nUm even today uh we've we've been contacted by administrators from a David Proud of high school in North Middlesex original high school last evening I was at a reception and Fitch bird and a a an administrator from Maynard high school approached me and said how can we become involved with the shined initiative that's great that's\nUm what do you need from central mass [noise] I'm In addition to funds to my my most most direct in simplest answer would be an open mind\nAnd just be willing to talk\nEngaging the conversation with us with one another\nUm tell me about this a big event you have coming up on October Eighteenth\nBoy nice segue because like talking about keeping an open mind yeah the uh the title of our gal is a keep your mind open this will be twelve or and you will and uh\nIt it has been I'm a great pleasure to be involved with that ... and to see its growth we've been fortunate than over the years to attract some dynamic keynote speakers last year Margaret Trudeau former prime minister or a wife or the former prime minister and mother of the current prime minister of Canada was our keynote\nWe've had Patrick Kennedy and Mike in ... in the past and this year we're very proud to have a Tanya brown a sister Nicole Brown Simpson as our keynote speaker\nShe's an author she's um she has a master's in psychology a she's a mental health advocate in addition to being the sister of the lake Nicole Brown Simpson when does the event\nThe event is Thursday October Eighteenth that begins at five PM mechanics all people must pre registered there were no walk ins because we have an enormous crowd every year we generally welcome four to five hundred people or to the event uh one thing to note about Tanya is that um long before her sister's tragic death\nA tiny herself had been living with depression and uh it had gone on diagnosed and treated and in the aftermath of her sister's passing only exacerbated the condition but even then she remained in denial until she recognized that she had to ask for help and now she's become\nA tremendous uh advocate uh promoting mental wellness\nThe event is October Eighteenth mechanics hall in Worcester for more information nine seven eight\nEight seven oh one for nine for or you can email a pie Richard at shine initiative dot org if you'd like to grab some tickets um I think it would be a great advance for anyone to experience a just to find out information\nLike you said keep an open mind open your mind about certain things and different things especially when it has to do with a mental health and um children\nYeah and another wonderful feature of the event is that we are honoring and saluting the students who've become the backbone of our student wellness advisory teams are so attribute to them that evening\nI'm telling me about some success stories are the people that use the shrine initiatives come back and say hey thank you so much for what you guys did and what you guys said you helped me along with this crisis that I was in\nWe often hear from a young people especially we've developed a great report and an ongoing relationship with a there are several who come to mind immediately a young lady who a few years ago I had formed the first student wellness advisory team at her school are and they called it um [noise] well they started a series of refresh days and um\nShe was someone who uh had lived experience and yet a with proper help and treatment and being a someone who could ask for help and had great parental support graduated at the top of her class got a four year scholarship to the University of Chicago ah we brought her back\nSeveral times as a speaker in front of audiences of students and teachers and parents and with private funders and um and she she's absolutely dynamic and she is dedicated to the shining issue if she said for the rest of her life\nThat's great I I think programs like this uh belong in our schools I think they should be required to be in our schools and talk to students and teachers about mental health uh about suicide about drug dependency about gender or questions I think all of that stuff\nThat our children are seeing on line in social media\nUm [noise] it it needs to be addressed from a professional level instead of seeing what everybody's opinions are about certain things on line and social media or because everybody\nHas been Worcester speaks out for news radio five eighty or Ninety four point nine ... W E a G ... views weather and traffic station [noise]\nI'm Pam who sell stocks news that charge from President Trump who says Democrats are openly inviting illegal immigrants to violate our borders this as a caravan of about two thousand migrants crosses into Mexico from Guatemala\nBecause you can't buy an index you can buy an index fund\nBut the fund is going to have expenses which means you're not going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and in any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years\nAnything can happen in that short a period Ohio was suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're gonna hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that is the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year today they're saying that over the long term they're expecting targeting\nAn assumption of seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know\nOhio doesn't pay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the same cost that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point now let me take another step further\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating six festival returns is by picking the right\nInvestments in other words there are Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell\nLook at it this way according to temper on in twenty twelve\nThis is six years ago\nThere were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them being the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them\nShowing if your savings and investments can

mail I got this weekend\nGood morning my name is John I'm I'm listening to the mixture right now I'm looking\nTo eight expert discuss those people that don't have enough in there on\nFinances to retire and this must be a sixteen year old he quote expert I'm sixty four\nI'm lost a tremendous amount of money during in the market my husband passed away a hedge fund and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I and again sixty four is a jet\nThat companies should work until there Saturday because the guy in there to provide money for their retirement is\nYou know it's not just saying I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing that should be considered in one's life\nOn them their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working can be very exhausting um for people that are stepping day and um and Seventy five I mean\nI think that it's an incredibly um thoughtless comment she has made on this show this morning\nAnd I'm horrified that he is agreeing with everything she has to say why don't we just worked for where Ninety or two we guy maybe that's the thing to do\nThat with that is now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she saw said but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault but she's not finding herself in retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get\nProfessional financial advice before throwing all of her life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives I feel badly for her but I have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation\nUm but here's another voicemail but I got\nAnd this boys you might recall hearing before but listen\nI'm calling to say that I listen to their work at home and tell us quite a while\nAnd I decided I Would never invest and him or his company he goes on acknowledge him about a simple answer that take three minutes he takes Fifteen minutes and keeps repeating themselves\nLike he has our time as he is no longer a good example of like clear sweat thinking it's boring now that it takes up most of the show was stupid questions that she doesn't stop answering\nHe needs a little help I think she too old to keep going on with your show it's become very boring let's talk about the financial crisis this week set up going on and on about\nStupid question he needs some help himself to fix the show I don't just feel that I'm a psychologist several of my friends have listened to feel the same way he just wanders all over the place like a loss soldier\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\nI'm a college and to listen to this a maniac on the radio where\nIt goes on and on wham can wait a second maniac planting you can ask us man in the psychiatric help\nIs not pointing individual and their lawyers and\nHam life depended on it I Am absolutely I aged out of them and it's crazy renting get him somehow and shame on him my God man\nBut now what was fascinating here is look uh I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show",
