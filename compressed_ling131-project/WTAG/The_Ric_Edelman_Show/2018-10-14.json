{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Where mental health services formed the foundation of those organizations\nAnd the necessity when you're promoting to the community unique again in education and understanding of what those services are and how they relate to the people who are in need of those services\nUm so I think that that's the trap that we're both better on\nSo if I were to give ten thousand dollars to the shining initiative\nWhere we would say thank you number one of course I'm we're how would that money be distributed to the shining initiative program how much of it would go to administrative salaries how much would it go to a child care or or different programs\nAnd at the bulk of the financial contributions that we receive a go directly back into programming I'm much of it goes into what we now refer to the acronym being swat a student wellness advisory teams\nAnd classroom education and parent and teacher training and forms a which are expanding rapidly throughout central Massachusetts I'm much of the funding that we get through grants is restricted so if we're\nAsking a specific donor for money to promote a and support an educational program and they specific school a cluster of schools\nThat's where the money goes exclusively entirely through our special events fundraising ah which um you know would be I keep in mind open gala for example\nUm many of those dollars support our um staff salaries into overhead but we also get a significant amount of funding again we talked earlier about um stability back in the role it played in the evolution and creation of the shining issued if\nThey provide us with significant funding every year which covers most of the overhead so\nThe general fund raising that we do throughout the year we're able to apply almost all of that back into programs and services\nAnd are you able to bring your program into public schools we are\nNow many many public schools throughout central Massachusetts um we started a five years ago being invited by a private school in North central Massachusetts or to speak to students and we did and from there it just\nSort of steam or old gathered momentum we now have collaborated with a close to three dozen public and private schools and school systems about central Massachusetts and just the last five years\nDo the schools reach out to you or do you have to go find schools that want to invite you in a classroom to talk to their students\nEarly on um it was a painstaking approach to develop for poor and confidence with school administrators because this is the type of subject that oftentimes us suggests that gee what if a student or someone in our school a begins to ask questions about suicide for example ah we don't want to go there\nA but once we gained that confidence uh and we had the endorsement of school administrators um than other schools began reaching out to Washington now almost ...\nSimply it's from a school so we we um we get that contact in that indication which is remarkable saw virtually every school administrator told me that we have met with in the last five years have now recognized this social emotional growth and health of their students is as important if not more so than the academics\nAnd when people reach out to the shining initiative um is there a fee like do I do I contact you via your website or phone and say hey I got some questions I'd like to come in and see you how how does that process happen\nOr in response to question number one we are and that's what makes us generally quite appealing to school systems is that we have never charged a fee for any of the programs are services that we provide [noise] um [noise]\nYou know that may change down the road a but for now we're proud that we're able to do that and yes uh schools can reach out to us administrators and students oftentimes will reach out to us\nThrough a simple email or phone call by going to our website or they may attend a conference reform at which we present and a school administrator in the audience a student in the audience will step up and say gee you know we'd like to bring this to our school how can we develop a student loans devise your team and our school\nUm even today uh we've we've been contacted by administrators from a David ... high school north Middlesex original high school last evening I was at a reception and Fitch bird and a a an administrator from Maynard high school approached me and said how can we become involved with the shined initiative\nThat's great that's great [noise] um what do you need from central mass [noise] I'm In addition to funds to my my most most direct in simplest answer would be an open mind\nAnd just be willing to talk\nEngaging the conversation with us with one another [noise] um\nTell me about this a big event you have coming up on October Eighteenth\nBoy nice segue because that talking about keeping an open mind yeah the ah the title of our gal is a keep your mind open this will be twelve or any well and uh\nIt it has been I'm a great pleasure to be involved with that gala and to see its growth we've been fortunate than over the years to attract some dynamic keynote speakers last year Margaret Cho do former prime minister or a wife or the former prime minister and mother of the current prime minister of Canada was our keynote\nUh we've had Patrick Kennedy and Mike in ... in the past and this year we're very proud to have a Tanya brown a sister Nicole Brown Simpson as our keynote speaker\nShe's an author she's um she has a master's in psychology a she's a mental health advocate in addition to being the sister of the lake Nicole Brown Simpson when does the events\nEvent is Thursday October Eighteenth that begins at five PM mechanics all people must pre registered there are no walk ins because we have an enormous crowd every year we generally welcome four to five hundred people or to the event ah one thing to note about Tanya is that um long before her sister's tragic death\nA tiny herself had been living with depression and uh it had gone undiagnosed untreated and in the aftermath of her sister's passing only exacerbated the condition but even then she remained in denial until she recognized that she had to ask for help and now she's become\nA tremendous uh advocate uh promoting mental wellness\nThe event is October Eighteenth mechanics hall in Worcester for more information nine seven eight\nEight seven oh one for nine for or you can email a pie Richard at shine initiative dot org if you'd like to grab some tickets um I think it would be a great advance for anyone to experience or just to find out information\nLike you said keep an open mind open your mind about certain things and different things especially when it has to do with a mental health and um children\nYeah and another wonderful feature of the event is that we are honoring and saluting the students who've become the backbone of our student wellness advisory teams are so attribute to them that evening\nUm tell me about some success stories are the people that use the shrine initiative come back and say hey thank you so much for what you guys did and what you guys said you helped me along with this crisis that I was in\nWe often hear from a young people especially we've developed a great report and an ongoing relationship with a there are several who come to mind immediately a young lady who a few years ago a had formed the first student loans advisory team at her school are and they called it um [noise] well they started a series of ... and um\nShe was someone who had lived experience and yet a with proper help and treatment and being a someone who could ask for help and had great parental support graduated at the top of her class got a four year scholarship to the University of Chicago ah we brought her back\nSeveral times as a speaker in front of audiences of students and teachers and parents and with private funders and um and she she's absolutely dynamic and she is dedicated to the shining issue if she said for the rest of her life\nThat's great I I think programs like this uh belong in our schools I think they should be required to be in our schools and talk to students and teachers about mental health uh about suicide about drug dependency about gender or questions I think all of that stuff\nThat our children are seeing on line in social media\nUm it it needs to be addressed from a professional level instead of seeing what everybody's opinions are about certain things on line and social media or because everybody\n[noise] this has been Worcester speaks out one use radio five eighty or Ninety four point nine FM WG a gene twisters views weather and traffic

heading out to Troy in Michigan Paul's on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum pension briefly I've been given the opportunity to take on and why did your input on it\nSo uh the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo that's a yeah it's like they're no reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis\nVersus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a of an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to reduce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true out great Australian our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where where the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions as a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nOr so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one is lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put it and I are a\nYes or assuming you're eligible and in most cases
