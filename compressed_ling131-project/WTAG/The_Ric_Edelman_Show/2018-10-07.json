[noise]\n\nWelcome back to the Rick Edelman show we were talking in the last segment about the astonishing amount of money that parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even though sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers\nSay they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you\nFirst of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem\nTeenagers in fact as we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance\nOne third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for\nThis and if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you the ... one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [noise]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs\nThey don't understand how expensive cars are warehouses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad\nYou haven't told them I think so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenagers stood alongside you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate\nIn games with them when the time you go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nYour kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and uh oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet\nThe last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you
