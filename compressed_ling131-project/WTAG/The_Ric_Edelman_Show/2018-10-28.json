{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "And because of that we're very familiar with the other organizations like us across the country and there's about a thousand of us so that's great news isn't it has a lot of providers out there and communities across the country but what's amazing to us is where the only one out of that one of the thousand providers that is a license treatment facility\nI think part of the reason for our success in that area and becoming becoming that uh that type of a provider was a place and that place is called independence hall\nIndependence hall Tony is located in the beautiful town of shoes we Massachusetts and we were fortunate enough to acquire what used to be called calvary retreat center\nThis is a pet store all beautiful setting a twenty two acres of land easy access from major highways\nAnd we have a fifty five thousand square foot complex that used to be the actual retreat center where a lot of wonderful you know religious and spiritual activities took place for more than forty years [noise]\nAh we have a total of uh Seventy five rooms there we run an inpatient facility\nWe run day treatment programs were an outpatient counseling and ah although we are veteran specific in terms of we prioritize admissions to veterans Tony\nA by virtue of our license through the commonwealth of Massachusetts were open to everybody done a great thing about that is most veterans have a family they got a spouse they got a kid who might have be having some difficulties we can help anyone from any walk of life\nAnyone in the community that's the first time that veterans ink has kind of really gone full force into this area where we're reaching out to help the community 'cause you know for the longest time though it was the opposite accumulates helping us so then and I feel really strongly about\nThis since ... we have now that we're able to do something for the community that we're we're living in\nSeventy five rooms as a lot [noise] sure is but when you compare it to what is going on right in the drug dependency a right crisis that's not a lot of\nIt's not it's not and the demand for this level of care is enormous and an without exaggeration the phone does not stop bringing his Dutch ringing around seven thirty in the morning and it still ringing at seven thirty at night you know and these are poor folks who are just trying to you know get into recovery and get get away from the ... the ravages of the addiction that they're suffering\nIf I'm fortunate enough to get a in one of those bats yeah those rooms yeah how long can I say\nSo you're in for a really I think a helpful experienced on so right off the bat as part of our impatient program I'm One of the great things about Massachusetts is the law\nMandates that you get at least fourteen days of inpatient care this tremendous cuts in other states in the country Tony that is not the case you know then we'll let go this I'm Talia Massachusetts without exaggeration Massachusetts\nIs the leading state in the country in terms of veterans benefits and assistance to veterans you want to explain a little bit about that and\nSo we've been working with the commonwealth for a number of years and we've been working actually uh to try to organize and structure I benefits\nAre there are benefits are of course the federal level through the VA and they're also benefits at the state level food apartment or a veteran services are each veteran has to be assessed individually that's where it's a little bit complicated so one size fits just does not fit all [noise]\nAh so when we work these programs we work them in a way that we tried to make sure that the veteran is a ... getting all the entitlements that they earn when they were on active duty\nUm some Venice will tell you more about ah the clinical stabilization program over and independence hall and he'll talk a little bit about today treatment program and the outpatient program as well but these are things that we're doing\nBecause no one else was doing and we've we are not patting ourselves on the back but we're proud of the fact that we have been doing for ... for a long time when it comes to veterans and their families across you should you should be proud\nAnd and what you're doing there is a a huge service um and\nProof of that is what Dennis just said that the phone rings at seven thirty to seven thirty twelve hours a day people are reaching out to veterans ink ah for help and services for not only themselves but their families and their support people around them\nYeah and and to and I think I just want also mentioned that uh independence hall we've got our own separate website because it was such demand we had to create a separate website for independence hall and it's called recover independence dot org\nAnd recovery independence dot org is a great site that will help clients or get to us quickly uh all the contact information is there at recover independence dot org ah and and you could have shortened that a little bit\nYeah [laughter]\nYeah um but I I I also\nWant to mention dead so independence hall you know operates on a scientific model of following best practices of treatment you know a lot of these are are you know brought to us by a federal government and the\nA substance abuse the mental health administration which has great funding and really all of the current academic research has proven that the course of treatment we offer is actually the best practice or to follow but\nYou know to an all of that aside what it really comes down to is when you walk through our doors what you really get is a sense of love and compassion and those may be words that that don't feel appropriate maybe for a clinical treatment setting but really that's really that's what it's all about that I think when people come to us\nThe immediately feel this sense of care\nAnd and as an atmosphere of love and kindness because in the end the most\nImportant aspect of recovery is relationships\nAnd that's what a as all about that is what any is all about that is what any a therapeutic relationship is about\nIs a relationship and so when people come through our door from the moment they stepped through the door they they're greeted with a warm smile we literally give them a gift bag come to us you get a gift walking inside the door it's so so right away right away you feel while these folks really chair and and they really are are treated me like a human bee\nThat's that's exactly where it starts it's comfort to the person in need right or that they are in the right place and they're going to be helped\n'em and you know positive changes ahead of them right and like they say you know if if nothing changes nothing changes so yeah as soon as you walk in the door at veterans ink\nYou're greeted with that smile and you know I'm I'm sure you guys your staff as is happy to see people coming in as the people coming in are happy to see you\nAnd that's that's such a good point to make Sony because you know the ravages of addiction it it is it's a really dark awful set picture isn't it and and it truly is but there is actually\nThe flip side of that is happiness because there's there's a moment where a person says this is it I Can't take this anymore I'm going to change and that's the moment where happiness comes in with some sunshine brought to bring light on this on this problem and turn it into something that's more solution focused and try and going down in ...\nMore positive healthy highway well thank you very much a the\nTime flies when you're a when you haven't found another of we appreciate you taking Italian with thank you very much tone or it's great that you guys came in or we congratulate you on all you've done in the past and all you plan to do in the future for our veterans are they are so important to us\nBecause not only do they need our support but their families their families are making a sacrifice to uh when they are deployed\nAnd they're out um so let's wrap up on November tense that's a Saturday morning nine o'clock it's the veteran

to prevent you think\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... W E a G n double duty ADHD Worcester and I urge radio station [noise]\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because of the total GDP of the British Virgin islands has about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one tell nobody\nThat you won not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike a bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know secret police my house no\nAntibiotics that deposit box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert inexperienced in dealing with wealthy families 'cause guess what you're not wealthy\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it in your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. a limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottom list but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million metal taxes in a lump sum\nIf not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start doing that a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always now you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team is well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich to be with me and have a security detail around you your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible 'cause you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you've given them a million bucks you cheap little sun\nCome on you're going to give her ten million you just got Ninety two million dollars how much given your mom how much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children\nYour grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that is a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nMeans if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars\nOf the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty we haven't even talked about charity\nLet alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change their lifestyle massive calculation and preparation and planning

that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Rick and Rick Edelman dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation rate so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much interest I not only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nBut say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago put the money and cheap bills called today\nBut think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours it's bears and you are merely\nThe steward of that money you're the custodian your the caretaker of that money\nAnd if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals [noise]\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind meaning that\nIf your son or daughter had the million dollars they would invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much
