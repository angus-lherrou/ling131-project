dot com or call eight eight eight\n[noise] [noise] [noise] this is the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar winners and running down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nThe most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian causes but not that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubled Russian space program\nIt's the only link that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rot pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said a woman astronaut when us that's not one cause not go up the space station and they're in the Soyuz spacecraft which also writes up on a rocket at the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of group members are already up the space station gr we're gonna come back now the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency\nBut the official seal of approval on that for coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap\nOut the crew or not to turn down didn't\nSo apparently what happened is that it made it through about two minutes of flight staging first said second stage or what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nDetritus falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have drugs aging but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells me there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either an engine\nFailed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nThe rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age book on our side and the bread the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have an aboard auction until much later than when you abort your ground\nControl punches a big red button and a capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely powerful and just burned corrupt few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete right in the face\nThey said they were forced to do a ... entry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that stuff that they didn't have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of a what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot\nAnd even in a normal ... you're looking at maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so the ballistic ridge remains this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nAbbas stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in it glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle and away the shield is designed in such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to is this an themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways not heat shield\nSo it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to five sometimes six cheese\nA ballistic originally just means you've got up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet in because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine jeeze which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission what are riding with a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten afternoon huh and they showed some video the offense and at the point that whatever happened happened it started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you can see these two guys are hands are flapping around like they're trying to learn how to apply them and it's really it's almost comical yeah but realize it was a top ride because\nNormally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even before\nThey hit the panic buttons and cut out\nNo other way now these are rushing saw you spacecrafts generally they're pretty reliable as when I said I Know they had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening to SpaceX has a capsule getting ready Boeing has another one also what do we know about these\nSociety has has been flying since Nineteen sixty seven and its flown a hundred and forty five times so although that's actually not that many more than the shuttle it's been very successful they only had two crew losses back in the sixties and then after that it's had a few issues but generally it's been extremely reliable", "show_name": "Safe Money Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
