I. position do I have the right structure in place to be able to do that this woman did and she was able to turn things around and really saved the day\nBut absolutely and and again you know we're talking about some universal truth when it comes to retirement planning 'em and here's one that though I Wish we could but we cannot successfully a you know guess the market\nI mean you know everyone knows Warren Buffett is you know ... whatever you think about um I mean he's arguably one of the greatest investors of all time and you as a\nYou know a million times you can't you can't time the stock market uh not even all the time not even have he won't even try he laughs at people who are trying to do it it's very very difficult I mean I've had people come in and said hey I got out that in two thousand and made it the right time that's great and you can you guarantee you're going to do\nThat you know when you're Seventy five years old I mean it it's it's it's ... I I Believe in like all the studies have shown trying to time the stock market is really really difficult and you see these experts I mean I I was at a a seminar the other day and\nSo I was talking about a year two thousand and eight and what happened to Bear Stearns and and I remembered a watching CNBC a few days before Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns went down and one of the experts on TV was saying hey I think this is a great by at six dollars\nYou know so if you take an advice you lost all your money so I\nI got to be careful about that I I Will not a big fan of stock market timing or day trading or anything like that you know if you want to do that it's worth the money that you can afford\nThat we don't have to like go to Vegas right ... exactly yeah uh that's not a advisable strategy\nWell and and you mentioned this before too we are talking about things that are that are that are sure things if you will in when it comes to retirement planning and that you know um we don't know how long we're going to live now I mean there are some signs along the way but the bottom line is we don't all\nThat is true I mean you know you got longevity some people say well you know all that we talk about longevity but that does that really matter I mean we've seen\n... with all the medical advances I mean you got a plan we counsel people to plan to live a lot longer than they think they will write because I don't want to be eighty five Ninety years old and have no money\nOr be out of money and then because most of the folks will come and they don't want to be a burden on their kids or their family or they want to remain independent\nSo if you're going to live that long are the things that you can do to guarantee that you're not going to run out of money the answer to that is yes it all starts with the planning process you may have to move some things around\nBut absolutely for most people they can do that and it's really wise to do it\nSo you know and as we age guess what you got to plan for longevity and you've got to plan for rising costs those are the two big things you know and the big one the big elephant in the room is medical\nI mean milling comes out with this study and talks about what the average cost of health care is and how it's going up every single year and it's really really startling so you got to plan for ... you know if I'm eighty five and I've had people say if I Lived to be that long I won't be\nDoing anything you know I never I Know my feet you never know but\nWhat you might be spending money on that you're not the union is is health and that that's the real thing that we've seen a ... you got a plan for so planned for longer than I even if you don't have longevity in your family we counsel well you you could be the one who who changes that and and lives a long time\nSure I mean and I mean and good if you do\nA great if you want but if you're prepared but it's a it's a risk multiply it multiplies all these other risks right you know the longer I live the more likely I'm going to need some form of of chronic care yeah I I the more the more likely is I'm going to experience some significant\nTurmoil in the markets I mean the more likely it is I'm going to get sick get frail all of this stuff ...\nIt's a risk multiplier and you know you want to plan for that well\nLet's help folks find for right now or ... one more time in an invite folks to give us a call ... it'll come on and said Tom we'll talk about all these things and\nAnd to help you put a plan together\nGray so Steve look I'm very passionate about my belief that you deserve a secure independent retirement and that's why we offer no cost no obligation consultation to our radio listeners to help keep you on that path\nThis consultation will help you determine how prepared you are to handle retirement pitfalls like inflation health emergencies stock market volatility and taxation you work hard for your money so we'll work just as hard to help you protect and grow it\nThere are a wide variety of tools and services available in the financial world will show you how to harness those tools and services to create a plan that tailored just for you will also show you how to achieve a lifetime of security thanks to lifetime income\nSo let's get to work now so you can get the fact based approach that you deserve\nTo get better answer to your financial challenges and objects and if you call right now not only you get that financial review second opinion package that we've seen others charge up to a thousand dollars for but when you come in and you also get a copy of this brand new off the presses special report that we just released called the four oh one K.

Fox News that President Trump referring to the ... Democrats and the Senate and buy a house Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi\nAre and actually translated into a building that that works first and foremost as of baseball venue but also to fulfill all the pope's and promises that we've made to the community about what it's gonna be in terms of authentic Worcester connected to the neighborhood\nThe catalyst for development um we don't want something that you could go there and say oh yeah I saw something similar and you know city extra city why we want something that people who really\nGravitate to as unique in our center to west or an is pushing the envelope on what AAA uh ballparks can be and\nYou know the level of international\nYou know talent that was drawn to submit a proposals for the architectural design element of this um we can't go wrong no matter who we picked that's going to be degrees and how kind of much we want to push the envelope in terms of the concepts that we're able do employee here\nUm and one other thing I should mention\nIt was that the it's not all going to be done in back rooms so we're getting ready to announce the next day or two with the team a schedule for fan engagement\nUm where they literally going to go throughout the city each city council district and they want to talk to folks about what they want to see in this ballpark in excruciating detail from literally from\nYou know the family change in Rome what do you want to see do you want diaper tables and they are do you want you know particular type of um a quote from ... to a seats to vending stations they really want to engage with the ... how do you want the seats to feel look\nEt cetera because they want this to be something that really works for the people who are going to use it to people going to pay for the tickets\nAre so it's not going to be a fly by not going to be a Senate a quick survey it's going to be real sincere engagement\nWith the community about how we build this fall at this point\nHow much is I'm with you know and into relating with you [noise]\nAh very closely so through the uh interviews for both the on this project manager as well as the um architect\nIt was the city team that was in that and it was lucky you know it was January Smith\nIt was most of their key staff who sat there for two solid days are they probably are sixteen Eighteen hours or more of listening to the presentations asking questions you know kind of clarifying thing so they're putting a lot of time and then\nThey're here in a very you know engaged to a matter of fact I was telling Paul I talked to Larry over the phone over the weekend you know about the pros and cons of a couple of the\nArtist that he was going following up having coffee with a couple of them that have a studios in the Boston area to see this studio see what they look like kind of get a feel for them so um this is something that I Do a lot to do right\nRight if I\nIf I Am [laughter] that we work as a team and we have common interests here\nOr to make this be the best that can be for the neighborhood we need it's it's more than just a ballpark is the manager said this is part of the neighborhood we want people to go eat lunch sitting around there we want to make it to be like a um\nLarry Latino likes to say minor league ballparks apart amusement park we want playgrounds we want things around it they keep it alive even when there's\nNothing going on in the end we want the public to be able to walk the concourse uh [noise] you know most may minor league ballpark as one of the architects said you know depends berries a little bit about three times around the concourse as a mile and people can go there and at lunchtime do their three laps or something like that we wanted to be\nPart of it in the neighborhood not just locked up other than the ... one is an event\nThat that's why I think it's so exciting yeah yeah it really is and you know the whisker element to it you've got the inside of the car costs will have your traditional food vendors but the outside that with the the field as the backdrop\nI saw this down in Nashville they had all campers and trucks that hollowed out and they have special the food vendors are operating out of this we've talked about doing that was Mr diners\nSo having the old Mr diners that have the names on throughout the concourse and you can get a specialty food item\nAnd you know I'm just filling in as the boulevard\nDoes you know the parkway\nOr whatever it may be along the concourse overlooking the ballparks or feels again like western edge over the U.S or they were all may exactly they were made here and there are a big part of our neighborhoods out big part of our history so kind of a paying tribute to them and integrating them into this new modern facility rushing up\n[noise] so one of the big things that and I want to call that come in and talk a little bit about is integrated planning which is far less sexy or than building a new ballpark\nBut very germane to the pocket books of the people of oyster or\nWhether they be uh you know property owners themselves or rent just somebody's paying a water to a bill or if you live in the city of ... or or you or a business operating in the city of worse to somebody's paying the city of West or a water sore bell\nAnd you know we've worked really hard and before I got here uh Paul and his of previous boss Bob Boilen and Michael Brian and others really led the charge to try to fight 'em\nSome of the the about permitting um requirements that were being handed down from the EPA\nOr as unworkable or in terms of the cost to they will go into um past have to pass onto the rate payers in the city of West or are we all share the goal of wanting a clean environment we want you know\nTo make sure we're doing our fair share to make sure that what we put back into the rivers and streams of of Massachusetts as clean as it has to be but we don't want to be chasing you know I'm unrealistic goals\nUh when we can be doing other things that will have a bigger impact on the quality of the environment so\nNow we've been able to convince the EPA do allow us to try this integrated plant approach um\nWhich has led us to make the case to the EPA that we can\nYou know accomplish some very important um goals in terms of the environment but doing it in a more affordable way and do it in a longer term way uh I think it's a fifty year plus plan\nA that we really need the public to validate through a public process and we had one hearing willing to do another one on November race and we want to get the public kind of engage this conversation because it's very germane to the people in the city [noise] yeah I joined by\nJust give me a little background about two years ago now after two years of negotiating with a P. A. we got them to or I Will allow us to take this concept of an integrated plants and what that concept days is look you want us to spend a lot of money they want us to spend\nAbout a hundred and eighty to two hundred million more on the upper black some treatment plant after two thousand for permanent we already spent two hundred million we said look we can't do that we challenge and call we eventually lost\nBut even after\nWinning they finally realized that it might be worth a compromise because we said to them look if we have to do that we can't afford to do anything else you already did that to us once when we had to go from you know I I saw a rates went up for a hundred percent in just a short period of time between two thousand and four and a few years ago now it's even more [noise]\nWe said to them or an old city we have all the infrastructure a lot of it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds right after the civil war a lot of this stuff was built its all failing\nWhen we need to do to keep the city more than we talk about all of this economic development we need to have safe reliable services both saw in water to us citizens\nAnd that is more important than chasing some limit that we don't even know have a benefit to the river because I fail infrastructure particularly the soaring draining destruction that's been neglected the most over the decades\nIs going to cause more harm to the environment it's causing harm now\nTo the environment so they actually caught on to the concept innocent degraded planning concept came out when cities like lister all over the country and the conference in ... in in Congress men started saying EPA you got to back down a little bit so\nWhen we said to them is let us come up with a plan which we're doing now will be smitten next year\nHis we think we need to do and here's what the community can afford it so well we're also doing is an economic analysis on what the community can really a full on Wednesday will set the priorities to people who know Oscar the people who in the trenches\nWho knows where our infrastructure is in the most may want to be able to keep saying yes to a new development\nOr as an aside there's a lot of communities they can't bring on these new biotech companies they have big watering silly uses we want the manager to be able to say yes when some company comes in and says I Want to open up and on a factory and\nSo we need to keep our capacity and I and our systems working so the idea is that the community to know the best will tell the EPA kids how we will prioritize over a long period of time\nTalking about economic development there is none when you don't have water that people feel safe to drink\nOh my God nothing else ... nothing else can I Wish I was reading\nThat ... that was an issue but I remember when I was there we read that ... I mean to a fairy shrimp and we ought to know um they don't work ah actually these little micro swimming around in your water flash\nI mean you do in a city you know what you eat and drink it and also it it didn't pass federal standards\nYeah we didn't want to spend this kind of money we were fighting with each other so it's like\nA you know it was probably the one of the best things we ever did it huge reminding that I Know we were actually squash university at that time they just some studies with the city of Worcester and cost should I I was chair public works at that time when we started that whole reminding from um now was a big step forward\nAnd we were actually still doing it but all the major pipes it done but we're still doing probably for a million a year in in New Maine's in in relying on aging process in the water yeah but that that a filtration plant we knew at the time was the right thing to do was a big investment\nBut it it's paid dividends all these years and will continue to pay dividends because we can attract\nEconomic expansion without reliable safe water\nAnd ... and you think about who some of our biggest customers are the people who employ a lot of folks polar beverage ... Abdi gab this\nProbably one of our biggest water customers are a lot of the ... a sector\nIs very heavily reliant on water and sewer usage we've got a whole new by a manufacturing Berkeley have will she coming over building their first manufacturing outside of China in Worcester um we need to have these kinds of services to expand our tax base great those job so\nI'm everything is is linked together and that really is the argument that we're making\nAffordability is a critical part of making sure the system can sustain itself that we have enough people can actually pay the bill price will go right back\nNow is the tide and wherever you are is the place the citadel makes it easier to\nEarn your degree by offering master's degrees graduate certificates and undergraduate degree completion programs that are entirely online these programs are convenient for working professionals in those serving in the U.S military continuing to sit at a legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standards that consistently named the sit it out than\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute maintenance and we trained tomorrow technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician and the ISI area make over ... thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\n[noise]\n\n\n\nCity manager\nAt any cost is with US Marshal on Lucy oh gee [noise]\nHas a a yeah brushed it off and everything else I guess because there's so much in public rushed that I had me talk about building a ballpark not only infrastructure but\nUh there's the aspect of the code all these things being built and uh ... let me ask you a couple of questions maybe outside of the realm here maybe fall and helpless when there's a courthouse no one else Yup I don't see anything happening down there\nYou are you going to see stuff at the end of the year probably in December so they are two months ago got what they were really anxious for is the historic tax credit allocation their first allocation about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nUm [noise] you know we sold it last December a to them so they actually been paying taxes to the city\nUm we did a bunch of the clean up the one element of the clean up a that we held money and reserve but we were waiting to do with them at the windows or the windows a historic so they need to be maintained but the window clocking our have PC bees and other things in it so\nWe need to take them out we wanted to do it in concert with the developer so when we took them out they were doing whatever other kind of work they're replacing them re mediated um [noise] I think\nThey're developer the construction company might want to do it in a different schedule so we're talking that's true but you should start to see actual work around the end of the year on the courthouse and it was this historic tax credit allocation which was the big thing that they were waiting for how much a voice of\nThe boys club waiting for the city council to take up they sent it to the economic development the committee's recommendation that um I said to them that we sell the boys club\nFor three hundred thousand to wind development um when development within a do a lease with cement academy which has a program for my kids with autism going right up to the college age level\nUm Wynwood redevelop it\nAnd then release it to them that's important because when as a for profit they would pay taxes on the property or and have a well lease a that would be paid to win\nA we had a number of parking issues we needed to work out the way I'm church next door worked with us the city kind of recon figured a few things to squeeze out a few more parking places so they'd have the sufficient parking", "show_name": "Safe Money Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "20"}
