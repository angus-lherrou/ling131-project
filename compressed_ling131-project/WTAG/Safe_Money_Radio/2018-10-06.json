{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Sure so I mean again it's not a situation you've dealt with before I mean you kind of alluded that you've that similar situation\nI have I've dealt with a managing a trust where we had five beneficiaries and there was a wide range of ages and I have not this much but and we just had a couple of different investments strategies within that trust\nBecause some of the money was going to be paid out soon and a bunch of the money wasn't going to be paid out for a longer period of time so you know working with the attorney and working with the client\nOr the made the decision that we can take some more risk with the money that's going to be paid out the way down the road and maybe not as much many more safety and the money that's going to be paid out relatively soon for for some of the beneficiary so you know really every situation is different but that's ah we we have dealt with that before\nThe cook and end up you know good for Penelope that the she's thinking thinking ahead and wanting to leave that for a for the grandkids that's pretty yeah that's great and that's all right though I'm ago scholar a is asking she says I've been bombarded with ads featuring robo advisory platforms that have a lot of online financial planning tools\nWhat do these tools lack that an in person financial planner can provide\nYou mean other than a personality she's\nYeah that's a good one you know so the the the growth of the robo advisers the benefits of those are for it depends on your situation for a lot of younger people [noise]\nYou know there's no minimum it's less expensive for sure uh to to do deal with a robo adviser\nBut it really is a one size fits all of a situation and that's the big difference between a scholar dealing with a professional human being who was a planner is going to put together a plan for you that's unique to you it's not a one size fits all situation\nTailored to your specific situation so that would benefit from a human ... the other thing is human emotions again we talk about that in investing and there's been studies done that\nHuman emotion sometimes affects how people react when things go poorly with their investments we've seen that\nAdvice or can help people [noise] you know stay on track the other thing is Steve accountability which is a big one for us having a trusted adviser there's accountability is accountability two goals is accountability to results is accountability to the plan\nFor the advice and that that's how we can test how we're doing\nWe have accountability and the other thing is ... ability having the flexibility when like we talked about earlier today when life changes will happen or disasters happen I don't know if uh\nRobo advisers are going to be able to walk you through those types of things so those are the big things I see you know everyone's different some people would people in retirement they want that planning most of them that they might in and these other uh attributes to a human advisor as opposed to just the investment side with those robo advisers\nSo is there is there something can be said for the algorithms that they work with I mean ... is that is that a good thing as long as you've got human intervention ah\nYeah I think there are I mean I think that that you know the big thing is cost I mean we're seeing some\nSome hybrids where people are offering robo advisory type services for the investment side but also you know other planning services sometimes you can get a little bit of both\nBut you know it's just really depends on how old is different but how people view that in what their specific situation in the more money that you have usually the more complexity with things like estate planning and making sure that\nFinancial strategy is lined up with my my state plan with my tax plan things you know there's just more to it than what you're going to get from just a and investment you know menu from a robo\nAdvisers understand so scholar at George said to have a little human interaction with the euro retirement planning eight hundred nine zero one six zero three zero as the number to call\nWe got time for one more what's the what's called a genocide who says my husband is retired and is receiving benefits union pension he's turned Seventy years old will be drawing Social Security benefits also I'll be Seventy years old next year and will continue to work as a professional health care person\nNow the question will Social Security limit our benefits if I continue working do I need to get spousal benefits should my husband to draw from my Social Security again while I'm scared\n[laughter] well do you know if you're filing an a Seventy that's after your full retirement age you can work and there's not going to be any hold back or Social Security are at how much money you take you Mary okay\nThat's a ... and again that's the that's kind of thing I I think sometimes it's confusing to people too is that after your full retirement age that whole thing of you know you can only make certain you know ten thousand dollars or whatever it is that goes away\nYeah yeah that's true so what's your of your full retirement age which you are obviously if you're going to collect a Seventy you know you can make as much money you know without any hold back already penalty on Social Security of course it'll be taxable\nBut that's another story do I need to get spousal benefits well if you're spousal benefits depends on what what your benefits are which is half of your husband's full retirement age Social Security was more than what you were going to get at eight Seventy you'll get the spousal\nIf it's not the it'll just get you'll get your benefits based on your record okay All right up and up next so it just depends on what you if you want to do by the way see we have a a Social Security workshop coming up October eleventh at the ... club if any you know if you\nIf you want to come to that that would be a good a good way to get your uh your questions answered and what else does just call in and we're having another workshop uh October eleventh setting eleventh alright I'll be coming\nRight up a eight hundred nine zero one six zero three zero that's the number to call you can get yourself involved in that also meant let's just open up the phone lines to everybody and invite them to come on and sit down and talk with you about the plan and and you know maybe make things a little better\nYes so for the next five calls who calls right now with at least two hundred thousand dollars in their retirement accounts were going to offer complimentary financial review of your entire financial in retirement plan\nThere is no cost for this visit it's simply a chance for you to get an education about your money so that you can make the best decisions for yourself moving forward\nWe find Steve that most people don't have a true understanding of three basic things they don't know how much they're paying fees and conditions they don't know how much unnecessary risk that they're taking\nWith their nest egg and they don't understand the tax implications of their retirement savings will sit down with you and help you understand all those issues and many of our radio listeners who go through this process eventually become clients but others don't this process isn't designed to turn every listener into a client\nIs just an extension of the education that we try to offer on the show\nWe can't give specific advice for your unique situation on the radio so this is an opportunity\nTo get some answers to some of your specific questions or maybe even ... some questions that you didn't even know you needed to be asked so if you

Vance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in cancer cells now\nThis immune based approaches sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time these two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs\nTo target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells it's T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nThat I mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune system as sort of its own\nNatural check points or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack the healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figured out how to exploit that and so they in some way that sort of latch onto the brakes of the body's immune system in a way that helps and escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off all the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he is key true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to an yes for TV commercials now are promoting the use of TiVo and keep true to I think primarily lung\nCancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drugs has shown some problem is\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it there's also a costing somebody's immune therapies can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so\nThat has to be figured out as well but Dr ... himself as even said this is a work in progress\nBut he you know confident in his own work and progressive these treatment says by the end of the century curious could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this that\nStudies have shown that as welcoming as these drugs are and as much as they represent an bats each drug alone I think for the most part only works in a minority of\nPatients that we see that in the study what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients they can have a lasting effect that can help people live in some cases for years to the trick now is to try to better predict in which patients these drug will work and by\nDoing things like ...
