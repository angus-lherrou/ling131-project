CPA about that show is set up my own Rother use the employer now\nWhat will probably make the determination is if the employer will match any are part of your contributions to a raw four one K. that should take precedent you want to force that employer to make the Maxwell contribution for either one of these things but anything more than that no way\nAll right bye good to know I'm sitting here the one eight hundred nine two zero six six eight six the number to call or you can get yourself a spot this week with Richard and uh let's go to Vince I'm a very simple question why would a person choose a mutual fund over an individual stock\nWells is you'd probably get one of the easier questions to answer this week has been a couple of bused that's for sure or I Would add an alternative ... should have personal choose a neutral foreign\nVersus an individual stock versus an eighty eight okay first of all you choose a mutual fund versus ... it'll start for the obvious reason it's called diversification\nOne individual stocks are going to analysis I'm working with somebody right now he has a significant part of the retirement in his own company employer stock\nThat stock has not done very well this past year and give them when I saw on the nightly news you know it may take a heck of a hit\nOkay I don't want to get into any specifics here on the other hand uh when you start getting into a mutual fund let's say\nA the ... enough and the five hundred index mutual fund or you're ... you're tracking a group of assets that have been put together to parallel five hundred in the U.S and the five hundred euro up more diversified okay\nSo the answer is short and sweet the mutual fund your goal is to get diversified\nAn individual stock is an individual stock now let me talk about the third alternative which is an eighty eight and exchange traded I'm a ...\nA ... uh our our form give you the best of both worlds you you've got a lot of diversification there but you don't have the negatives and the mutual fund the expenses in a mutual fund are very hard to okay and they go far beyond just what they tell you is the expense ratio okay\nWhereas in ETA you're going to find your expenses are a fraction of that but you still have the diversification All right so\nI Would say bench take a look at mutual funds take a look at individual stocks and also take a look at exchange traded funds\nAll right All right fair enough um let's go to Clinton a time for one more Clinton says\nUh my advisor or with a well known company has about retirement portfolio in twenty or more funds thirty percent an ATF sense for cash buttons\nIt's very confusing they claimed to be a ... the money is safe but returns given this year for point nine percent of not been good enough in my opinion I'm sixty five years old my spouse to sixty four is my portfolio spread across too many phones given my age\nWho that's a good one yeah All right let's talk about they claim to be a fight do sharing [noise] I'll tell you how you find out if you're dealing with a real ... uh and that's where the rubber meets the road first of all\nSo I Do share is going to have a written agreement with you if you're going to sign up\nThe advisors going to sign up is going to clearly disclose what his fees are any potential conflict of interest or a and it's going to be an rotting and it's going to be terminal at will in other words he keeps you happy or you rip up and walk out the door with your assets\nSo that's a clear indication if you've got one of those you're going to ... in reality and if you don't you're dealing with a stockbroker\nNow as far as the dispersed one of these assets I don't understand the for cash funds\nCash fun to me it is a lot of drag if your money market account and I had one today a came in about seven o'clock 'cause they usually do in the morning have a cup of coffee and start running through these reports in analyzing things quietly before the crew shows up at eight I bought a you know you're\nYou know your cash today a brokerage account is probably earning twenty or thirty basis points that's twenty or thirty percent of one percent I don't care how well the other portions of your portfolio are in fact doing that cash yield a solo it's dragging down the overall portfolio\nWhy there needs to be four counts how much is an old accounts that is the first place I Would look at is not working for you know if you're using as a checking account and that's your slush fund that's an entirely different story altogether okay All right but again I'm seeing some things that raise my eyebrows in that question and\nMaybe there are concerns usually your God is pretty good yeah if you're God's telling if something's not right in your mind is kind of falling slowly behind go with your gut\nAll right I think that's a good I think that sort of technical and very good I like it I like it a lot well I'll tell you what let's go ahead and get some folks in in some way to meet with us in and talk about plans and um let's open up the phone lines right now Richard\nYes and if you'd call us in the next Fifteen minutes we're going to do a custom designed for
