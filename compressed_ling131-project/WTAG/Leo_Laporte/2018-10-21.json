down the iPhone doesn't nudge to everybody doesn't much nowadays and not just not so unusual but the notch and the iPhone\n... wide is shallow it's not so deep that Google notch is deeper and narrower but for some reason it's just as offensive to some people\nAnd and I'm not sure why you still have to make room for two cameras there's two selfie cameras is a ... a narrow in a wide 'cause nowadays you know the kids it's all about the selfie and the wide angle uh lets them get more people into their selfie\nInstead of having super long arms around the Academy Award some years ago Ellen was doing a ... a selfie of movie stars and she couldn't I couldn't get her arm out far enough to get all the movie stars in\nSo somebody I Know Bradley Cooper somebody took the camera and he had longer arms but if they had this wide angle think Samsung does is to\nYou could get them all in [noise] so it's got to cameras it's got it's got room for speaker there too I don't I don't find it in the least bit offensive\nBut a ... round them audio who I Love a at Ars Technica called it a greasy phone [laughter] only be known only means but I just didn't like it [laughter]\nI think it's phenomenal I'm happy to screen is much better than the previous pixels so if you're looking for an Android phone and you don't mind spending seven hundred fifty or maybe it's eight hundred eight hundred bucks\nFor the base model if you don't mind spend that money I think I spent almost a thousand on this she's but I'm just you know this is now you just used to it\nJust what a phone call is [noise]\nI think it's a very good choice for an Android device [noise] ah\nI also got the the eighty dollar charging stamps or expensive but it does I guess it's a symmetrical things about what it does it does some magical

Italy although I Do I Am well how are you good thank you so let's talk about ...\nYou know let slash [laughter]\nWhat's the latest leaked\nWell last week we were talking about a first man this this new movie that neither you nor I liked very nicely I did yeah and I wonder I went to an IMAX theatre and specifically I went to the IMAX theater because\nIn this movie in the ... in the last scenes more more or less the M scenes of the movie when he's actually on the moon in IMAX only the picture becomes taller\nBecause they shot those sequences on IMAX cameras yeah\nAnd so and this is a trend in movies there are quite a few movies a surprising number actually that have at least some of the footage shot on IMAX cameras in IMAX cameras have a taller picture\nSo this this involves what's called the aspect ratio which is the ratio of the width of the image to the height of the image now most\nMovies that you go into a normal send them to see are have a particular aspect ratio this quite why that's why they're called is called wide screen a but in IMAX the screen is more square is and so the ah the image is taller\nNow when they show or a regular movie in an IMAX theatre they there's black bars on the top and bottom of that screen but when you use an IMAX camera to capture some or all of the movie the image actually\nExpands up and down to fill the entire screen and that's a reason to go to ... or a bunch of movies that have been shot this way at least in part a Dunkirk other Christopher Nolan's Batman movies\nSome of the new Star Trek movies um some of the transformer movie star wars or Captain America civil war bunch of them [noise]\nDiverse handed out of the movie though doesn't it to ... when that happens\nYou know it doesn't I surprisingly it's a very good point surprisingly it doesn't I hardly even notice so okay generally speaking out you know you just you're just going wow\nLike when he's on the moon and it has expanded right it's it's much more impactful\nAnd immersive and up till now the only place that would happen is in an IMAX theater\nBut now IMAX and ... the company that that's big into theatre sound have developed a program called IMAX and ... which brings that experience into the home\nSo they said ... ... ... ... ... [laughter] I mean I'm going to watch the the movie on a smaller screen the whole time and then suddenly it's going to get big\nWell now this is a very interesting question because what it does is went in those scenes when the uh picture\nGets taller yeah uh\nMost people have a ... a screen that is sixteen by nine right sixteen units why nine\nYeah Reggie White that's called wide screen but see it but movies are typically even wider than that and so when you watch a movie on a sixteen by nine screen you have black letter box bars above and below a because the aspect ratio is wider than it is that tall\nSo these new IMAX enhanced movies and Sony Pictures and paramount pictures are signed on to do this for movies that have this changing aspect ratio they will expand to build the sixteen by nine screen during those scenes and\nSo they've got content on board and they've got a\nHardware companies on board Sony at the latest CD a show which was a about a month ago a little more than a month ago in San Diego a Sony showed their\nFlat panel TV's end projectors all having this capability ... a built in ... then we went over to the sound of United booth which is the parent company of ... and then on and [noise] they're\nA ab ours audio video receivers also\n... some of their new ones will have this capability and they the older ... some older models will be able to be updated with a firmer update to support this and so it's it's a way of bringing IMAX into the home where\nThese expanded scenes in some cases entire movies fill up your entire screen\nWith with information now the interesting one interesting part about that is that the IMAX aspect ratio is even taller than sixteen by nine right still not getting everything that you would see in an IMAX theater but you're getting more than you would see in a typical movie presentation\n[noise] so it's it's pasta now one question is well are they going to have a different um a different\nA Blu ray or or how\nAre they going to work how is this going to work we don't know yet that's one of the problems you you know very well I'm sure that retailers hate having multiple versions of the movie you say or something for sale oh well if you have an IMAX enhance system you can buy this one and it'll give you that advantage\nOr there are other advantages to the system to their they've they've done a IMAX sound immersive sound is twelve channels including for overhead and so their their format it in such a way with special base management that that sense the information to the sub woofer that need to why they're\nSpecial receiver and has in addition to at most this is something else yes no I'm afraid so ...\n[laughter] ah however your standard at most speaker configuration will work just fine\nUh and and you kind of want to reduce the computer and rebuild the route or just to reload that\nIt could even be your Internet service providers DNS service sometimes who who's is you have a big Internet service provider or a small one who's your promoter heart Cox it could be you know usually the big guys like Cox and Comcast and ... and they seem to have very fast\nResponse of DNS look up and uh and they are not the problem but occasionally it is\nThere are ways to diagnose this my friends Steve Gibson has a DNS benchmark tool\nDownload for free from G. R. C. dot com you just Google DNS benchmark and find it\nAnd that'll that'll give you some idea of how responsive your Internet service providers a DNS server is there are you can use others there's no requirement that you have to go to your Internet service provider so if that seems to be the case of the unresponsive then you can use a\nLot there's open d._n._s. Google has one class where has one ... one the one that one\nI'm not saying that's what's wrong but that's certainly something to check more likely it's a router issue have you tried do when you when you have this happen to you ... your router ever\nHappens almost daily\nYeah that's sometimes routers uh this happens when they're getting flaky\nAnd people get mad at me I ... I Know he's going to get mad at me scooter excellence and might be in the ... going to yell at me they say routers never wear out routers wear out\nThere this was three years old right that's a little young to be wearing out and then by the way airports are very good apple one of the they used to be the most expensive routers out there they're not any more 'cause all writers are expensive but they used to be high price was they put they put good chips in them and they put good quality stuff in them\nBut one of the things that happens with routers in my opinion\nIs a because a lot of traffic if you use them heavily if you have a lot of computers and a lot of bandwidth and you're using them heavily they get hot and that I think in my opinion can shorten their life so sometimes it's the routers fault and rebooting the route of unplugging it wait waiting you know\nTen seconds and plug in your back in again or if that fixes it then it isn't\nProbably the Internet service provider or a DNS server issue is probably that router is is of flaking out it's a computer right and so the first thing that happens in a computer gets unreliable is it ... you know it freezes and that's kind of what's happening to you write a router freeze but\nWhat about the fact that I got like eight out here to do what's your what's your router yeah\nThat that's a band with I was talking about right there so each of those cameras depending on the quality of the image might be using ... megabits per second if you've got ... megabits constantly flowing through that's router that could be it yes\nThere's a lot of things that could cause it yeah one thing you might uh one thing you should know about I don't think this is commonly known as you know when you get your when Cox tells you what your bandwidth is they'll tell you two numbers of big one in a little one the big one is you download speed the little one is your upload speed\nIf you saturate Europe load if what if what is Cox tell you and by the way this is their best case scenario which is the maximum knock the minimum ... Cox tell you\nWe have a film and white photograph the dollar take our outlook like forty years though\nOh good that's a lot but again if you got if you've got eight security cameras each feeding a high def stream at a mega bitter megabytes and a half each now you're using ten of the forty all the time it that's the other thing if you saturate the upstream your downloads will stop\nBecause even though you have more bandwidth Morehead room on the download every packet you download typically at a Web page gets acknowledged on the upstream so download a bunch of data okay got it next one\nDownload a bunch of they got it if the got its are being blocked by saturated upstream your downloads will stop so you might try since they're all in one switch you might try just unplugging that switch and seeing if that fixes it\nYou shouldn't have to rebuild the route or for that one the other other place to look and you know I the reason I'm giving you all of these things is because there's so many things that could cause this\nIs the the ... the cable modem from Cox itself also is a computer [laughter] and it can you know get worn out are often when you get these you're releasing them from the cable company which means they're\nYou know huge to an old\nThat might be another one brand new no good well that seems less likely but re booed at you and when you own it not that not the Cox folks yeah yeah\nYou know that's always the best way to go and it saves you money usually rent so steep on these I'm All right but again it could be the problem so what you have to do is kind of narrow it down slowly unplugging\nPlug and re boot and so you figure out what the heck's going on\nOne other related question yes\nOh a lot of people on line it was just setting to a local wink mode but no one really explained it like it up you know what that is\nNo no idea local Lincoln mode normally I mean in my mind a local link Modi is when you're going to an internal link like one twenty seven zero zero one home I'm I'm not sure what they're what they're talking about ... at this would be as a remedy for this\n[laughter] yeah yeah local link mode\nNo I'd have to I'd have to Google that they may and the ... you know what you've been reading read it again haven't you it sounds like something we read it read it or sort of come up with oh yeah you're going to live in ...

a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them you write\nCall today and we'll get started\nWell the first thing I got to do is get a better cell phone providers are better data plan anyway 'cause you shouldn't you know those are that's the old days where you get ... for going over that's the old days nowadays every provider offers the normal day to plan which is uh you you get five\n... they cut off and say unlimited but it's usually five gigabytes or thereabouts after that we slow you down they shouldn't charge you that boy that's a\nThat's a big bill to get so you're wondering what happened\nYeah well I Know this is a weird part and I just started about a drop box I wanted to see if you could help me figure out what to do with my provider I went into the cellular data I don't know I've heard Renee rich call it shaming section ... says what al ... data yeah\nSome out books ended up still using cellular tried on section and you know I think\nTo turn it off and that section right I'm right\nNow as I've I've got a call the number eight hundred number or sorry the gator you got to pay for it and I'm like gosh like you know I I pay a monthly fee I'm not complaining that I pay too much like it it is but\nThis is crazy and I wrote the c._e._o. an email and I get these calls every couple of days from you know the president's office and they leave like dictionaries may eight hundred number and they'll they'll call me but I don't know what to do it yeah it does help me and my stomach [noise]\nWell you know ... who's ... who's the provider\nIt's T. oh gosh\n[laughter] um I mean I technically you're stuck I mean you're contractually stuck at you you you even acknowledge that you use the data so but that doesn't mean that they don't for out of public relations or want to give you a break on it and usually they my experience has been they will\n[noise] um I Know tweeted do you have a Twitter account\nI can I can come up with a Twitter account\nYeah [laughter] so for reasons I don't fully understand and I and I think are foolish corporations still to this day really treat Twitter complaints as like escalated like oh that's the worst possible scenario you know you if you were to create a Twitter account\nToday you have zero followers that means any tweet you sent out even you know if you at AT and T. and maybe do all the ads you can find that are Eighteen the corporate are not being seen by anybody except the people you're sending it to [noise] they still will freak out [laughter]\nThey feel OK here's this I don't know how much longer this magic power of Twitter is going to last because it's completely absurd but that's certainly one route they are very nervous about social media they don't want to get a bad reputation social media um although I have to say I\nI had a problem with Comcast some years ago this was a six or seven years ago and I have at the time I probably had half a million Twitter followers and I I read something and I did get a call from the Comcast office of the executive that's the you know it's Brian Roberts the CEOs office\nBut instead of saying how can we fix this they said can you stop tweeting [laughter]\n\nSo maybe that was seven years ago maybe they're more savvy but it's been my experience that for some reason the tweet carries extra weight Facebook tweet Instagram they they're really worried about getting a bad reputation as social media and I guess the reason is\nIt can escalate as we've seen time and time again even though Twitter has only you know as a small percentage of us users\nAh you know mostly media for for some reason that carries a lot of weight than you did the right thing you wrote to the c._e._o. or his Randall Stephenson so I Can't remember who the CEOs Eighteen\nMr Randall state was that I wrote ... yeah\nYeah so by doing that\nYou're in theory escalating but he's pulling it off on an eight hundred number when you talk to support always escalate there's they may I talked to a supervisor be polite\nYou can usually you can get out of these but I have to tell you they don't they're not required to you you buy your own admission you use that data and then I Would immediately stop and I would immediately stopped using whatever plan you're using\nAny and everybody and right now should look at their data plan because these things happen especially in an iPhone\nIt's very difficult to find all the places there is a list of things that use cellular data in your settings and usually I Would just turn everything off if you if this is something you're worried about\nBut it's tricky it's tricky and by the way I phone usage so you're usage may not match the companies and they're going to ignore what your iPhone says\nBecause we now with these smartphones and the iPhones really a a big offender you so much data so much data all the time or is it really is worth checking this and maybe making\nGetting a a plan that doesn't ...

speed mesh system out there that you're\nWarm yet yeah as a matter of fact if I go measuring a speech and the various rose\nOn my cell phone yeah up there either about one Ninety\nClothing I wow but my question\nIs why are the laptops my laptop so not reading that high of a speech and uh they're they're between Fifteen and thirty\nYikes that's terrible [laughter] that's quite a degradation\nA there are a number of different reasons for that of course different um why adapters have different capabilities the antenna where it is the chip set itself a that's a particularly pathetic performance or how old are those laptops\n[laughter] it's a new Dell is brand new huh yeah All right so\nThen the other issue is that of course why a ... protocols have changed we started where they do to to eleven B. which was the slowest\nAnd only on two point four ... hertz we're currently at eight oh two data live in a sea which can do to point forgive hurts and five ... hurts in fact you can do to different ranges of the five ... expand and can handle much faster speeds\nSo some of that is also the protocol the laptop can handle I Would expect a brand new Dell to have\nFull ac compatibility so you might check to make sure that you're running the latest driver and that the software the wife by software there is up to date\nA but also remember his you know where the antenna is nowadays nobody wants external antennas that's going to affect at a distance from the server will affected maybe it'll affect it more if that's got to bat antenna\nIf you're right next to the server it should be closer to to to hire you I wouldn't expect to hundred honestly\nUh because they're you know normally with why fight about half but again this is where the ... pretty impressive it's it really does give you a lot of the full bandwidth available to you so I'm I'm Amazed you're getting that much on the phone that's really really good\nAt it in ... by measuring between like I should uh with the phones I in fact you know let's leaks X. box and upper bedrooms on the second floor they don't like any more they used to like yeah but what it's called this a or B there is no law but I just said that question about\nI use I don't I you know a speed test is one way to do it but there are some really good why analysis tools out there for windows like insider with two S's that will help you there's one called ... analyzed his free on the Microsoft Store\nUm net cut is another one get one of these that spot is in that spot is kinda cool 'cause Neff spot\nWill actually let you make survey the house so you can wander around with a laptop it'll make heat maps saying we're ... best weakest and so you may learn more what you want to make sure is that you're on the best band five ... by the way this is something that ... that people may not be aware of [noise]\nThey may look at this that or be might be doing this it might look at the different devices and and say you know in order to give the best performance to let's say the guy in the living room watching Netflix\nI'm going to give lower performance the laptops that only need email so it may be champagne doing what we called bandwidth shaping as well depending on the device that's one of the things uh that is a new in these ... and the or be as one of them\nSo that's another thing to be aware of um [noise] I maybe insiders not the best choice as to what I use but it's it's expensive but\nI'll tell you what I'll put a a list of all the different tools that are out there for a wife I analysis\nThat will help you better understand you put that on your ... and that will help you better understand it also tell you whether you're getting all the bands you may not said del may maybe only on two point four guards in which case thirty would be great\n[noise] okay so that's another show yeah yeah yeah well thank you\nAre going to be alone when I hear you you\nGo to court I Would just pay it but\nHere you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge Ito your honor here's what happened a B C and D and die they said we should have filed the police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker\nOn a license plate because once I put the sticker on license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nBecause I think micro check it every day yeah exactly\nI think it does I think paying it's a different these in defense a shirt tell it to a judge because worse happened you're gonna have to pay for the chicken anyway yeah\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen\nAnd the and the fun one\nAh the people come up and they said you'll see with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or you're not so whenever you see someone guilty when the next when they are depending on the judge or if the judge allows the person to explain just to get it off his or her chest the ... the judges eyes roll which is always kind of fun ah or the judge will say\nWho cares\nYou know explain it to your pet rock Wyler because I don't want to hear it so I Would go try it why not I I think if you look at it I mean it's it's certainly as why don't you go what you're saying\nHi Stephen you're up welcome good morning Yes sir\nBill I've got a question about employment ah I signed on with the company or back on the two thousand and part of my original shop off or was that I Would be entitled to a bar of a minimum of ten thousand dollars per year\nAh the pay that bolus for both the first six or seven years and then not when the economy hit the skids second two thousand they\nAh they continued not to pay me that bonus for a total of nine years\nI left the company last year and I'm Wondering if I have a case to go back and and take a lot\nFun right so here's the question All right they breach the contract\nOr by not paying you a bonus of a minimum of ten thousand years or ten thousand dollars a year which incidentally uh there was nothing in the contract that said no matter whether they made money or not or the ... the economy I Know you'll get your ten thousand right\nThat's right All right so they pay you for nine years in particular reason you waited nine years to not get paid\nOh I spoke to him about it and they basically said well you know our economy here and\n... and I understand that match and so that's the reason now I can understand that for four years when the economy tanked\nRight I get that right but after four years or you're still looking at five years of the economy doing much better and to the point where the economy has\nBecome a has gotten on fire I mean it has exploded for the last couple of three years and why have you didn't you go in there say hey guys I didn't because the economy was really crap during the recession but now that it's doing great and that everybody's making money how about a check you didn't do that\nI did that bill and then but my ... but he bought my salary a little bit but he didn't pay any bonuses\nOkay so you accepted uh the salary bump and then go after the bonus\nYes All right so now a let me give you a fun a a fun legal aspect and it's called a stop all\nWaiver and stop all that yes T. O. P. P. E. L. stop all which is a fun way of I guess the Italians say stop to stop all it is a legal doctrine that says even if you do have a case\nIf you will whacked not to go forward and argue your breach\nYou accepted that and that's the argument they're going to make you have accepted the fact that they're not going to pay you a bonus now uh can you go back you're not gonna go back nine years I guarantee you that I can you go back\nUh maybe but they're going to keep on arguing I Would saying hey you know what yeah we had a deal but we weren't dealing with it and he's obviously he's OK with it so um\nYou can talk to a lawyer how many the bonus shot ten thousand dollars by the way you at least ten thousand dollars is very interesting uh but let's say the only be liable if there's liability for ten grand and that's over nine you're Ninety thousand dollars you know we're talking\nTo a lawyer yeah yeah so I talked to a lawyer and we'll see how far how far it goes in hello and
