I Love I Love con men a lot of great movies and books about con man\nThey're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new kind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general if I were to generalize\nAll of these games play on one thing your greed\nSomething for nothing so that's the that's the alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell\nIn general things like the pigeon drop require in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have a low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast\nAnd I need to help somebody in America I'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent but if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever\nThey're going to get money out of you so all of these ... games in the long run will take your money but the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart and the the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful\nFun things into your home as we enter late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook can you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to sell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram they're all free well but there's something there there's a way they're making money 'cause they're not free for the guys who run those companies is expensive so\nWhat are they make and how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free but [laughter]\nThat's only because we have fabulous advertisers now I'm really careful we pick ads and advertisers that are products that use and like so I don't mind I'm happy\nTo recommend like remote PC there's a good example happy to remain recommend ... sees a wonderful tool very affordable and you get great value for your dollar it allows you to access any computer a Mac or a PC\nWindows or Mac from anywhere using a Mac or a PC or even your mobile devices that's very handy I Do a lot of tech support for family and friends that lets me I put remote PC on their computer mind\nAnd then I can log into their computer I can change things I can move things around I could upload fixes download files it's awesome great if you have a home office and you leave stuff at work and you want to bring it home or vice versa [noise]\nNormally very affordable fast it's efficient it's secure and it's only about six dollars a month for up to ten computers but right now I've got a better deal and this makes it really worth a try it's one of the reason I'm happy to get these guys on our show if you use my namely or check out that's the ...

Africa was Morocco off in two weeks in more oh I bet that was fun\nIt was amazing the variety is just that different climate zones dancers the dunes there's did the see there is ... religious the atlas mountains I'm just ... amazing variety amazing\nAmazing photography and ah I brought a hat\nYou were in ... where they apparently invented the says\nI was in ... that I bought of course offends [laughter] and uh as as we do a review of the a hat assignment on today that's why I thought I'd where it's\nPerfect to honoring the assignment shift so these assignments so generally our monthly although because of course has been out on assignment we uh we have been we're a little behind but people submit pictures of in this case hat illustrating the costs are pat and Chris picks three to take a look at and you've got three for us today\nI Do I went through the pictures things every one for a handing them in and I made a choice of three different hat related pictures the first one is by Gregory Chesney yeah and\nIt has a title kind of a title old school ducks Jay pig [laughter] well that's not the cameras name for sure so now he he he ... he gave it a name that Jay ... is probably not part of the name anyway um yeah what are we looking at we're looking at a black and white photo of\nSome mask\nThat has uh you you can see the front of a baseball hats\nOn it but it's all very out of focus very artsy very eye looks like it's probably been taken with a pain in the whole or with a with a lens baby or some weird lens that but I kinda like it it\nIt this is not about the photo being sharp and focused Crispin colorful and contrast ... this is about the feeling that this conveys and looks like it's been shot on film there's scratches on its um books yeah looks looks just it just feels right\nIt's really interesting it's perfect for dia de Los ... which is coming up looks like Dr ... mask related to that yeah [noise]\nSo is it that it touches on the had a thing just by having this\nYou know nowadays you look at something and you say well that could be a pinhole camera or it could have been taken with a regular camera and then filtered process [noise]\nThe way this this works jail metric plea with the depths of different different things in a different different total are I Would have to do think it's probably a on a lark I think is probably not a a digital filter neat\nWill say anyway I agree what else do we have here well second one is by a user ... goal news G. A. U. N. I. S. um doesn't have a proper titles and\nChris the glamour of added in there that I Do not like I went through it all the pictures they have one of the flick or the other day I made sure they all titles just because he is good yes yes\nI'm so it's yeah what are we looking at looking at a little tugboat all sorts um but it's not just about it has a face an ad on I have no idea why you\nSee it or you just obviously you've never seen\nIt's probably a cultural a pop cultural relevance to something in the United yeah but I Am not aware of how it all hang engine it's a kids' show oh it's from Thomas the tank I think so yeah\nIt ... it does it does it it probably that means it doesn't it doesn't click with me as much as with anyone who you're always you're not from around here\nBut it's still clicked with me because it's a huge and\nOne look at face it's cute as a hat on [noise] so um I think it's a fun boat\nI like it the door to see there is but it anytime there's Texas the picture I just make that the name of the picture so they that's what I Do\nI'm you know that's that's that's the simplest thing you can do for a making\nTitles of your photos yeah think simple if text isn't a photo as you said make that title [noise] um if something simple is\nOn the photo something very clear is on the photo that's a subject of the photo then make that the title like I did in the next big chair oh they bowl and has a photo of a pink hats and he called a photo cat it's that simple out so\nIt's a good one too I this is this is a bold pink this is a very pink cat I likely to end it there\nThere are several reasons why first of all this totally clear what this is about it's a big had um the cat is in focus its biggest in the center so it's a relatively simple photo there is stuff going on in the background seems like a reception of some sort of people they are talking to each other but it's it's clear that the hat\nIs the thing that that this is about because it's in focus and the rest of our focus [noise] um there's also a nice little color contrasting going on with the woman wearing a hat whereas a green dress or at least some green dress up green red is a nice primary color contrast and you can see that had\nBeen kind of looks like it's like the windy so that gives its a motion with in the things that are on top I don't even know what you call those but\nStuff that's on hats you know [laughter] um yeah I like it it it jumped at me because it's a Chris clear the colors are bright and it was just a little cheerful photo of a hat\nI like it too it's like ... or something some event\nLooks looks like high class you\nKnow he has a classy picture a class I'm like you and me who are wearing our pheasants [laughter] I I think of it is a really classy high like pheasant I Love them and they're perfect for TV 'cause they have no brim so they don't block the light\nOutdoor cameras a nest it makes outdoor cameras I have to nest outdoor cameras that worked quite well\nFrom a nest dot com and then I'm a ring also makes outdoor cameras have lights on them that can come on and so you can see everything that's going on all of them work at night\nSo you're saying her camera she is she's seeing what what is what is what is going wrong it's not recording it's not she's not seeing video what's going wrong\nFor some reason I think they're the ones in coming up it was a long time ago sometime last year that there was some kind of an air methods popping up and\nShe kind of did it pointed her mobile honestly I Would just throw it all out or try to sell it on ... and get a nest camp [noise] I'm so much\nCheaper I ... at any effort you spend any ... what is this guy going to cost you know to fix it it seems like a lot of work um and and frankly not as convenient solution the DVR solution is the old way of doing this just recording locally [noise]\nUm so I Would I honestly that's what I Would do there is and that's coming out during his campaign two hundred dollars\nHigh definition or does need why fi access because it's it's connected to the Internet via why find the nest has a website you can go and see what's going on at any time or you can see previous you you can get alerts on your smartphone\nInstead of having a TV set up with the DVR she's using her phone I'm I'm ... it's hard for me to diagnose what's going on with the camera at this point because I don't really understand the question\nWell the thing is that she had a mobile app for it and I'm just like I don't know all the details but on basically the question of if I get to see the art replace\nA replay the DVR and please [laughter] that's going to cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution\nI I think she's got a uh she should\nWrite the whole thing off a the camera records to a DVR via some cable that she's got attached to the camera that\nComes into the business is that it [noise]\nYeah and it's all connected on I mean her network I mean her home network and everything so she was able to heal it remotely\n[noise] I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own set up and they look to see what they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\nWell if you're going to do it on an app\nOver the Internet it's got to be stored somewhere [noise] um is there if is it a privacy concern or is it a costs concern [noise] all the above okay um I think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video I'm the\nFirst cost a I think it's it's considerably more affordable already spent more money on this thing then you'll spend over you know five years on a mess [noise] ah the picture is going to be better I just don't know the brand that she has a I'm not\nSure he again what you know name yeah sure what you're trying to do you say you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the era message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seeing the video is that the problem\nYeah because it has an H.

Beach\nHi Daniel Daniel yeah I mean I'm like oh you're Daniel let's make let's get that clear okay are you from are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am\nNow to get what ... what are the minimum ... there's all these different languages like where\nYou want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal\nI'm thinking about it maybe I something under site so in the early\nDays of the Web\nA Web page and actually it's still true today when you actually look at the ... what they call the source code of the Web page a Web page is composed of a couple of different things HTML\nWhich stands for high protects markup language is the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means it's very simple says this text should be bold this text should be a tell aside this texture be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise]\nAh yes yes yes that was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credible it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this ... this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays have a website is you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website in the early days we pushed it altogether you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in the text editor we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nA CSS the style she still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use of programming language called job a script to do the fancier things animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language that all Web browsers understand the job a script typically stored on the server as his the HTML the CSS\nAnd the data and by the way the data's usually store to the data base right that things like the text the links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design today you're probably going to be learning something called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you design\nA interactive pages the most one of the most popular widely used it came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react Twitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because for years job a script was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will then it'd be interpreted as a job a script something like closure you could do that with go or ... variety of other languages and then you don't have to write and java scripts but if you but you need to understand those fundamental technology so if you and your spare time you'd like to say yeah I think it would be ... by the way a great skill\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing java scripts CSS HTML you need to understand those\nThe other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the content is stored and the third part\nAnd often these are different people doing this but if you really if you want to do a Web does if you want to become a Web designer and I have a little shop you know people hire you\nThe third part is design you need to learn design you needed to learn how to make a Web page look good had to make it usable I mean design includes not only how it looks but how people use it and we spent a court I'll give you an example here we spend a quarter of a million dollars\nFor my pod cast website which you can go look at AT T W.
