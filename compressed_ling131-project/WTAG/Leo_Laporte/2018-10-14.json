I was so upset about it I wrote a blog post when I got home because I feel like\nThey shouldn't like Hollywood touch modern history and history 'cause they just mowing set up and it was it was more about and I don't even know if this is true that Neil Armstrong's inability to communicate and say he loved his children yet it was about the most important\nExploration and scientific achievement of of our lifetime in probably the millennium maybe of all time landing a man\nA mom and that's right that's right I was totally disappointed at that too although I have read that or some of the interactions in particular when Neal arm when Neil Armstrong's Wife says you must tell your kids that you might not be coming back\nThat apparently was close to verbatim according to his sons who were there when when he told them that but in any event I still\nWhat is that the most important part about landing a Mayo June\nNo Armstrong was an astronaut he had the right stuff he wasn't a big talkie levine touchy feely guy so what yeah exactly and he will either way without the hugely dignified guy after he walked on the map so literally where he's much higher life he passed away a few years ago\nAnd in in in every respect loved and respected by everyone and he didn't he didn't get all nutty about it he just would did his job and that's what you wanted\nAn astronaut and either way there's a scene in the movie at the at the end\nI don't want to spoil anything well how can you spoil it it's we know what happened no no they but he does this thing at the end it never happened they made up oh you know with a man with a bracelet it never hello right that was completely made up\nThey ... they gave this guy who is not a great director he got a lot of accolades and almost one the best actor best movie word except he didn't like her la la la la la la land Damon ... should never give it to give it to Ron Howard\nDid an amazing job with the ... gene was much better give it this is Albert or give it to something Tom Hanks\nGive to somebody who can make the the ... movie\nNot this guy he made it la la land for the moon I mean\n[laughter] there's no there there's always singing and dancing but the music when they're doing the moonscape is kinda crappy\nI agree I totally totally agree with you I was not happy with the music I was not happy with all of the hand held\nFast with well that's another thing I Want to ask you 'cause you saw it and I ... I just saw it in that mode yeah Dolby theater which is very very nice yeah and it's really when they're when they're getting launched if there's there are some good things to this movie and one thing is\nI don't know how accurate it is but if if that's what it feels like getting launched wow [laughter] I Know I Know shaky that the rockets banging like stuffed banging like it's falling apart yeah yeah and it's I'm at the mercy of sound is amazing no question about I'd have hated to see an IMAX though you saw it and I\n... I did and the reason I did was that most of the movie is in an aspect ratio that's typical for movies called to point three five to ... which means that with the images to point three five times wider than it is tall\nBut then during the moon the lunar scenes after they actually land on the moon the aspect ratio or ... gets taller\nOr and if you go see it in an IMAX film theater which there are only a few it really gets taller I didn't see that I saw I saw it at a in a laser IMAX the Chinese theater in Hollywood the famous Chinese theater and\nIt it opens up a little bit\nAnd it's meant to make the moon vistas look more dramatic and I'm sure it does is it a little bit ... when we went from two three five to one point nine and so it got a little taller\nAnd a little more impressive but only in the last few minutes of the movie it wasn't worth it to me and I wish I had seen it and do the cinema because the shadow detail of which there's a lot\nIn this movie or was not very good yeah and the IMAX presentation I saw so there were many things to complain about technically the sound was not one of them sound was beautiful um [noise] but I I Wish I had seen it in an IMAX that really opened up at the end but I'm afraid that would not have saved a movie for\nMe it was still pretty facts like when they do stuff like that it kinda takes me out of the film I mean yeah it does yeah you know suddenly you're aware of the fact that oh there's a ... I'm watching a movie and I just I actually would do that kind of cookies gimmicky stuff\nWell in some cases it's effective yeah but I you know Ryan Gosling just looking ... out into space so much it's just like come on\nAnd did Neal Armstrong really sound like he came from Minnesota yeah sure you betcha\nActually I Do first of all he's from Wisconsin second of all that accent came and went\nAnd I feel bad because Claire for who is so good and the oh yeah but it's really the crown right yep yep yep really didn't they gave her nothing but anger in this yeah pet peeve to the whole time at him because he just wants to say he's going to the moon to the boys he does want to\nAll right yeah I got a point out that that's risky I mean somebody gets your phone they can do anything they want with

for holding on [noise] ah well I Hope you can help me because I had a complaint lot oh what's the matter [noise]\nWell I think I had a power outage and when they came back around like Spain savor what's gone and um my biggest problem is it's not opening any of my checked shirt anymore\nI go into all like AQAP ... like ... like can't levels and from my camera and I could I double click or I click open lipstick pasta which was like eight all and it says you cannot find window and it won't open the picture\nSo you're ... voted the computer right\n[noise] do you know what that means you turn it off and on again [noise] you know I Can't remember if I get it\nOr try that first ah so the first thing to do is to go into the its windows windows shut down and and just shut the computer all the way down count to ten than pursue power button in boot it up again and see if that fixes it\nIf it doesn't then maybe get suffered some hard drive damage it is true that when the power blinks out even if it's only for a second there's two things that can happen that are bad for computers are very sensitive to power whether it's a spike and you know a lot of times of the power goes out when it comes back on its boom it's a big spike\nAnd that can just fry stuff but also low power brown our power which often is\nA precursor to a failure power failure it goes real low that can also damage stuff and then of course there's I bet you in a it was pretty dry and form a hobby I'm thinking do you have static electricity issues [noise] no no okay that's good ... when it's really dry like that sometimes that can that chips are\nVery sensitive to all of that\nSo it is possible to have a static Matt\nEnjoyed good good good yeah that's important [noise] so uh it's possible that during the power outage I'm ... something physically went wrong with your computer that is not unheard of uh in fact I generally tell people it's a good idea\nTo spend maybe a hundred bucks you spent a lot more than that on your computer hundred bucks on a nice uh something from ... I got my mom I just got one 'cause I got a new t._v. if a cyber power and it it's a sign you want something that does sign power conditioning as well battery in it\nIf the power goes out or keeping machine running a little bit not for a long time and just long enough for you to shut down properly real problem and it might be this sounds like what it might have happened to use or even if you didn't get a surge or a spike in power\nWhen the power goes out if the computers in the middle of doing something like writing to the drive and the power goes out\nIt can ... can be data right across the drive and so\nUh it's it's not a physical in that case it's not a physical error but it might be enough to erase or corrupt a key filed it sounds like that might be what happened to you or if that's the case that's an easy one to fix the hardware fault\nSo you can get your windows a boot disk and run a repair routine on that if you don't have a windows ... if you're on windows ten you get

because of it but the but it seems like only the wall Street Journal really wants to get Google back for it\nSo they wrote an article that really uh\nWas gazing about Google they called it a breach they said that Google Plus\nThey they found out they found the emails that Google Plus had a flaw that allowed a third party programs to access your Google Plus profile information even if it was mark private\nKnowledge when that came out I looked at my Google Plus profiling you there's no credit cards they're the only thing you put their you know there were two things I had private my home address what that to get out and my personal cell phone number I don't want that to get out\nBut it's not the end of the with not like they got my Social Security number my credit card you know put that on your Google Plus profile is essentially a public profile with a few private field I think the I Can't even remember ... plus it's so old now but\nI think the private fields were for friends and family only that kind of thing so some outside party got information that I intended only for friends and family and by the way Google\nWhen confronted with that said well okay so we found it in may ... we had no evidence that anybody had figured this out words using it so we fixed it and that that\nAnd this happens all the time Microsoft slide slugs and windows all the time they don't necessarily reveal it they fix it\nIf if nobody gets bit by they fix it\nAnd until GDP our went into effect later in this year a nobody had to say anything about it I don't know if Google would have a duty to disclose now but it was no breached that's the key in my Wall Street journal initially they changed the headline later called it a breach a breach implies that somebody\nGot and then got that data but there was no evidence that it wasn't a breach it was a software flaw which happen all the time was fixed\nMaybe Google should have told the world I don't know you can debate that Google and as I I don't know if it's related but a Google says they are doing\nAn entire route and branch that's what they call it a survey of all of the stuff\nThey do to make to let third party developers use Gmail or Google Plus or any of any of their stuff you know you can you can sign up for a system and given permission to go through your gi mailed it but like trip it which I use for planning it will look at my Gmail and look for\nUm [noise] ... confirmations from the airlines and hotels and they make a temporary for me on trip it\nAnd I liked that I turn that on I think that's a nice feature [noise] ah people some people don't like it but of course you have to turn on Google says we're going to make sure everything's doing it right and we're going to only allow people to go through the mail if it has a male application right in fact I think that's going to probably impact trip but they also said\nAnd now that we found out there was a problem with Google Plus even though we didn't tell you we didn't think it was a big deal we fixed it and may\nWe're going to close Google Plus anyway [laughter] [noise]\nWhich no I don't think many people are shedding a tear over there are a few people my French Trey Ratcliffe is very famous photographer and really a use Google Plus the great advances one of the things Google Plus was Google's social network you may not even know I think people don't know\nPart of the problem what to do with it is that if you have a Gmail account if you have a Google Account you have a Google Plus account it's kind of automatic\nAs kind of a problem but you don't have to set up a full profile or use it as just you have an account if you want one\nBut one of the things was great about Google Plus has a display photos beautifully I mean really nice job and so photographers like trade Ratcliffe another's used it and became famous ... had more than a million followers on Google Plus\nHe had drove a lot of traffic I think it it helps him become a household name among photography buffs he's actually a putting together a show of people saying good bye [laughter] to Google Plus a little premature Google Plus is going to be here through August of next year but\nI thought that was an interest in reaction OK Wall Street journal [noise] you're gonna ding us for something that we is it really ... we're just going to close it down so there were taken our ball and going home\n[noise] I think most people don't mind because if you've been on Google Plus lately has really fallen places really falling apart social networks do not do well if neglected have you noticed that it's like a garden the weeds start to grow\nSpam or some trolls ... ... stuff and that forces out the good stuff people God I Want to go there anymore pretty soon after you neglected long enough all you got his weeds\nThere's still some good stuff on Google Plus it's not all weeds but I think it's probably time to shut it down I don't really blame Google for doing it it's just a

E. and that's all spilled normally the opponent is weird\nPie W any de have I been bones dot com it's a free site and if you enter in your email address the email address for instance that that was sent to you'll see if that email address has been revealed in any data breaches or I just entered in my main email addresses and says\nOh no tone based on twenty breach sites we've found\nAdobe or anti public combo list Apollo bit late discuss Dropbox\nEbony exact is exploit kick started last FM linked in little monsters modern business illusions mice space I even have accounts and many of these [laughter]\nA ticket fly trillion and Tumblr all have at breaches with my email in it and in many cases password so that's that's what this is coming from is these ... these databases which are passed around widely they've hundreds of millions of addresses and passwords I'll read you a one originally when I got\nAn unlimited does bring up a good point on a reason why I never use the same same pattern every world that's right they have one from an old one who knows\nWhat'll happen exactly right and and that was what really scared me except that I realized that that password I hadn't used in years and I've been you know I don't it's not current on I mean my my sights currently\nBut that's another reason why last ... last pass or one password\nWould also be a handy because they will let you know if you've ever used passwords so if you're worried about that you can go through a with a security check up on a pass revolt generate new passwords for those sites and that that's really important to do yeah I ... I appreciate the tip or I'd ... I'd want to read you the one I got and I bet you this will sound pretty similar to these er\nI I Want to emphasize is you're absolutely right Jay these are scams\nThey haven't done any of what they're saying they've done but they and we talked about this a few weeks ago that the real that the key hackers used to get to you is that they need to get you scared they need to get you jumping they need to turn off your\nBrain take off your thinking cap and act instantaneously are\nNow the problem with this scam is it's kind of hard to instantaneously get for teen hundred dollars in bitcoin together [laughter]\nAnd so I think that that's probably why this is less successful at it ought to be but they're trying to stay anonymous they're not too bright 'cause bitcoin is not an Amish here's the ... the email\n[noise] uh and it's been around for some time actually this is a blog posts from Brian Krebs Krebs on security in July [noise] uh and I found out about 'cause I got the email and I said what did I did a little Googling\nHere's the opening salvo I'm aware that\nThis password is your password it starts you don't know me and you're thinking why you received his email right\nSee along grammatical there so it tells us the hackers non native English speaker\nWell I actually placed malware on the porn website and guess what you visited the website to have fun you know what I mean while you were watching the video your Web browser acted as an R.

M. D. which will open up the command prompt and then you could take those two words\nWhat will tell you is a little bit about your battery and in most cases it'll tell you if the battery has any wife left what percentage of charge capacities left that's what you want to know\nAnd if it's down to ten percent or less it's not going to hold a charge\nAnd that means you need a new battery now in most cases you can and the older you know modern stuff I'm just looking at this new extra skinny laptop I got was talking about\nThere's no way you're going to go in there and change the battery there that can be glued in the same thing with most whack a apple laptops but an older age Seuss almost certainly you can replace the battery so look on the bottom see if there's a latch or a lever that you can open up and take the battery out\nNow here is another thing now if you don't mind you don't have to have the battery if you don't care if you take the battery out usually and just keep it plugged in and a lot right just fine\nAnd then so now you have a desktop computer\nIt might be a little hard to find a battery for a ten year old computer but you can maybe go on ... because lots of people have the old computer and maybe they're selling off the parts\nThat kinda thing [noise] it's okay All right yeah I'm Sorry that that's happened but man you got a lot of life at a thing\nI Know these tiny Honda [laughter] down and get it\nBut not necessarily if it's all running finding when you were able to get windows ten on it and you're and you're comfortable with how it operates do make sure you keep windows tent up to date in your browser is up to date all the stuff that goes on line you're secure but if it's running adequately from your point of view don't listen to them just get a new battery or keep it plugged in\nOkay great\nOkay I thought my job to sell computers for the computer industry\nThey might think it is but then he might say that that my job man actually the ah we're all excited 'cause last quarter PC sales are up like four or five percent every was all excited\nThis quarter flat nobody's buying computers this is kinda cool though this is the uh the uh Easter is just as soon as they say the thinnest laptop ever made it sound like a millimeter thick that's crazy looks like\nThat the battery report is a dozen print out on the command lines screen but instead I'm looking at it looks like he gets saved\nTo your hard drive so you probably um [noise] probably didn't and then it looks like it's a Web page so you might open it with a browser that kind of annoying [noise] they don't make it easy to say it's for you know what it's for the IT guy let's say\nBattery report I'm looking at my battery it says the name of the computer system product named bios well that's nice oh west build platform rolling stalled batteries\nName manufacturers serial number chemistry Oh yes it does so uh this is the information you want to know in my case I have two batteries in this Lenovo uh each design one designed with twenty three thousand five hundred and\nForty million what ours and the other twenty six thousand megawatt hours full charge capacity\nAnd then it shows how many cycles battery one has been cycle forty four times battery three's been cycle thirty three times so I remember I said five hundred that's typical and it will then show you your usage history wow this is a great report thank you Microsoft\nWhen I'm looking for though is how much capacities left and I don't I don't\nSee exactly that what you'd like to see as a percentage\nDesign ... I guess the I guess what if you look at what the design capacity is that's the maximum and what your current full charge capacity as if the current full church capacities zero or very low\nYou you probably can't hold the charge so the operating system knows it's nice that it'll tell you it'll give you that information\nOr John in San Bernardino Leon report the tech I had John\nPartly welcome what can I Do for you\nThink you are [noise] yeah I just purchased a sense of a shoe led a initial television and I'm I'm watching Netflix on it and it's amazing the picture quality I look great\nGreat why why would I get a high end which started um HD Blu ray player yeah why would I Need to get a player with such a great dish or on a with a net flicks\nSo you may be getting if you have enough bandwidth for K. on Netflix is right it's a it's a great picture a and honestly\nI think the future is that people don't buy Blu ray disc or physical media but people who are serious video files and you know maybe that's not you but people will say I don't want the best possible picture\nStill by physical media because the quality of a ... image on the U. H. D. player or an HD image on the on a Blu ray player is better than the streaming quality it's not as compressed and so I'll tell you I\nI okay now this is the equivalent of a spoiler if if I tell you what to look for you might start seeing it and then you might start being unhappy so would you prefer that I not tell you [noise] oh please tell me [laughter]\nIt might make you unhappy [laughter] so what I always look at to see something called macro blocking this is this is a side effect of a compression and of course to get it for K. image down your Internet you've got to compress it pretty heavily where you'll see it most isn't solid\nColors or is it a solid black for instance right or a solid\nBlue if you watch something that has that macro blocking we'll instead of showing you a solid color show you bans it can't do a smooth gradient between deep deep deep deep deep black ingest a little bit less or black it'll do a band and so you'll see some banding in solid images\nIf you look really closely uh you you might see some ... in the images I always look at lettering that's a good way to kind of judge and I have to say Netflix does a very good job would therefore case streams I watch\nMost of my forte content and I have an old TV and I spent a lot of money on that\n... on streaming and it looks fine when I'm perfect quality you aged\n... to [noise]\n\nHey you've heard me talk a lot about absentee ... printers you're about to hear me again because the ups and he could take\nForty seven fifty is downright revolutionary there's a wireless ... printer doesn't use ink cartridges that means no more last minute runs to the store late night freak out because you've run out of ink he could take forty seven fifty as easy to fill in the tanks and get this they print up to eleven thousand color pages\nThat time I think you get in the box it's equivalent to thirty encourage says\nThat's if you had to buy the it'd be about Fifteen hundred bucks saves you money saved your time and when they say all in one apps and means that the ups and he could take forty seven fifty as fast auto two sided printing it copies of scans effects as in more go to ... dot com slash eco tank Leo to learn more and for a limited time now to November first you get free overnight shipping when you use\nFrom a goat eco tank Leo check out when you buy any ...

person with technology on ... about two things are you ready yes for Sherlock who tried on okay I Do like that Sherlock Holmes thing yes okay\nLeo I have a dish DVR and I have several TVs now I'm receiving over the air transmissions okay yeah\nSo art program on TV that go through the shuttle search and it seems the channels like All right okay well I go through the cello lifting the ones that have said there's nothing there now how is that possible it up above receiving information over the air the Charles exist but do programming\nBecause DeVos don't get their ... channel guide from over the air\nLittle little ... oh the general who makes the ours well\nNot talk about the TV's the TV's televisions they go through a trial search over the air for me antenna\nSo you don't have you don't have any Internet connectivity series nor did not\nOkay [noise] yeah the channel guide\nOn over the air TVs [noise] used to come I don't know if it still does from um actual over the air channels in the in the um [noise] frequencies in between the channels [noise] so\nIt may be the how old is your TV [noise]\nOlder their their new ark it though I mean there's no more than three or four years old most\nYeah [noise] um [noise] you just need public television stations would offer aside bands of their uh over the air signal to carry that data and I'm Wondering if they still\nDo that I seem to remember I'm looking to do a quick see if I can this quick search on this see if I can find this because I feel like they stopped doing that\nI'm\nSo in other words he drew you to channel guy has to be updated regularly obviously shows change times change and so forth if you're not connected to the Internet and most TV ours are and get their channel guys from the Internet sources T. Bo as an example one of the things that you pay for when you pay for your monthly TiVo Feehery earlier lifetime T. Bo fees that\nChannel God or you don't pay for it you won't get a channel guy but oh T. A.\nI'm trying to remember how these channel guys come in I'm pretty sure it's on the side bands of the TV channels and you see if I can I Need to find the or\nThe right Google Search for this\nAnd I'm not a chat room you have any thoughts about this or I Wonder if we have any experts he's talking uh I Believe about the the let me ask a cut you off for seconds your connections rate for if you're talking about the data about what show you taped and all that right [noise]\nNo no oh I'm Sorry you are\nTalking about the television program for TV ... TV itself to do with child search for walking the channels yeah when you go back to that guide the treadmill listening that channel is not listening there for channel ... they'll say does not exist\nOh I see what you're saying I'm ... I'm Sorry I misunderstood yeah the scan goes through and says oh I see a signal here I see a single here adds up a guide and you're saying it's not getting saved after you go through you have to go through the scan each time in order to use the TV\n[noise] no no journalist saved one through scanning it saved us face twenty Charles okay what do you go through the channels some of them do not exist\nOwes finding non existent channels [noise] yeah okay just delete them from your channel guide what was what was the favorite though\nBecause it thinks it hurts something [laughter] so that is an imperfect system [laughter] I'm Sorry I made this a big deal out of this and it didn't have to be so the way it's doing is it's going it's stopping\nIt each ... you know channel each frequency where there would be a TV and saying is there anything here and if it thinks there's the key word there is something there it'll add that channel your channel guy it's not a perfect system sometimes it thinks it heard something when all heard was [noise]\nAnd so it reminded remembered it and you can just go through and that's why there is a feature I think you probably noticed of deleting channels from your channel guy you may be a it's related to how bad your phone\nSounds you might want to get a better antenna uh the signal might be you know they might be noise in the signal um there was a lot of noise and your phone I'm Wondering if there might be some noise in your environment perhaps perhaps it's related to that I don't know I'm Sorry I misunderstood the question\nAh on on we'll go I'm just going to punt and go to combine in Chicago hello car my mail the port\nThe guy Hi Leo how're you doing it I I Am well how are you\nOh pretty good I was looking at a a circus book choose and the I should I'm running into it I Would like a sixteen games around I don't necessarily need the ice seven costs or or the or the extra video card and I knew that just to get my sixteen year you ran I've gotta spend thousands of dollars\nYeah hey you're yeah a a Microsoft\nHas figured it out huh [laughter]\nI was wondering if if there is a possible way I can buy\nCorrect yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't know if you're going to be counted but yeah you're gonna make\nLife miserable so ah if you want you you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's going to obviously have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer\nOr an expert in representing a representing a represent their lawyers to represent warriors in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I watch uh oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints\n... a basic based on the handle on law the advice I give because some people it took me to sleep\nI relied on that so anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize in this the first time out or when I was actually frightened nine now and bother so it's your call here called do I think\nAnything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the white you were a notch\nUh being I you were not a she was not being represented it wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate there your whole anyway yes\nHi I'm a God I hate\nThe winds All right let's try it a let's start again\nWe just lost you know there should be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send the guy to the moon that doesn't work anymore last time there was a guy in the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send a guide to Mars right at some point as well because back he calls back All right oh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Chris yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man a tax return from Eighteen years ago and I could get a refund of taxes paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now a hiding from having to pay ... or so\nI have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows someone to\nFile an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partners espouse a ... is not around either can't be found somewhere out there on remarried die whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules and now when you file your taxes or do you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve any way to do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is wondering yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up now and am I counting Chris just like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that\nIs what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yeah and you might have\nProjected that I actually find it might go [noise] and ah maybe\nNot just magically appear no no I I Would I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what\nI Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I go out that many grand behind the counter right that's another issue in there and they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay\nBased on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nYeah our cases and that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be around her\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as if ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone\nBooks thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not

Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio his daughter has special needs\nAnd she was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in the pool with some kids\nAnd when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just grab the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment so he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place\nFor people with special needs and and who don't\nTo come together so he created this water park thirty six million dollars\nIn San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs and America that's born out of three people yeah\nAnd so now what they pick their big thing was that you know for kids who are electric or in a wheelchair that's powered by either electric battery or they have a breathing machine they could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create\nA wheelchair that was that one hundred work wheelchair oh my God so they did it and they did it like that but by using compressed air and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp\nFor for ... with a zip line and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can do is applying with kids in wheelchairs breathing apparatus that\nThat is so cool\nBut you gotta watch video on creating a post right now I'm time magazine actually not time magazine magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New York times did an amazing video on it and now of all treated or put in a ...\nIn the chat room but this guy is amazing he really the guys to run for president United States but anyway um [noise] if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice on what I had to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on a zip line\nOh that that line oh that yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a a lot of water slide wow a line\nThat you don't need to take the wheelchair on the line or do you I think you do so you want to share with them\nYeah that's interesting very oh so what did you hear that out then it's such a neat idea Morgan's in wonderland in San Antonio Texas for ... magazine and yeah\nAnd then you've got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see now at least family I said I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate I'm so he flew British Airways have nonstop flight six hours or like sixty five people on a triple seven ...\nI Love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face on roe [laughter] yeah basically he did\nAnd um [noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is um if you want to be treated like a celebrity I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports by sea to all the time in LA when they department they transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and then it's called um black lane pass lack of lame pass\nSo black when I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now they have this past where they do in five hundred airports worldwide\nThey will scorched you so it was perfect for my mother in law 'cause my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow were planning to get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be\nFor a hundred dollars someone was waiting to moment she stepped off the plane so he got a website leader but you don't have to sign up ahead of time no with no clear is different clears for um security in certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was all there was a person they're holding a sign with her name by they grab their bags they walk through the cut the line for on immigration so she'd have to wait an hour in immigration lines I\nDo that I think they got to deal with the costs they had to order exactly wow and then they get your bags\nAnd then they go through customs and then you get they put you in a car if you order a car you can order carpet black lane or wherever you could whatever\nTransportation you want you can take a bus but they'll put you on there and she was like when we arrived she's like that was the best thing ever 'cause I've been ... I've never felt that way I ...\nAgain so it's perfect for people who are either nervous or business travelers who don't want to I Would do this\nFor my mom does not want to fly says eighty five years old she doesn't want to fly and her real fears that confusion what's your other saying it's why it's the confusion getting on and off she's you know she's really getting lost or whatever so this will be a great thing\nI ... a couple of years ago I had my dad fly from LA he met me in Budapest he had to go LA London Budapest and I wish this was available I knew about it because I was so worried about him\nGetting low on that one yeah and yeah I\nI had he not oh I get lost in Heathrow it's a nightmare\nYes and um so anyway this is a perfect thing for business travelers for families it's each the price a difference but it's usually around a hundred dollars per person so it was a hundred dollars for my mother in law for that\nThey often have more features they uh they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside on mash up and plume started they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date will want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links is router links to just wipe their hands ... thanks good\nLuck have fun and so uh I think it's not inappropriate for a company to say look we ... you know we have a digital", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "14"}
