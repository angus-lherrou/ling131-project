I'm not concerned but decorator problems I'm concerned with\nAn accurate viewing environment\nI have a couple of a news stories I thought you might be kind of into yeah in one I thought very good news or if you bought a movies in the Google Play store they are up as apple did their upgrading them from ... to for K. at no cost automatically ... marches on meanwhile\nVR kinda marches backwards IMAX is announced that they are going to close their New York me our center and they're in IMAX is known new virtual reality investments for twenty nine teen\nWow you know the IMAX has one of those centers here in LA and I was thinking about going to one that was the problem everybody was thinking thinking about\nYou know most of the I looked at their website actually and I saw that most of them are you know shoot 'em up type things are really scary action movies yet or action yeah but I just want to go and and you know be in a world and they have it be beautiful but then you know I guess I don't know [laughter]\nI ... I should I I misspoke not movies but we are experiencing it was right\nNear and dear yes correct but you bring up an interesting point and that is I've always thought it wouldn't it be\nAll to put on a a high resolution VR headset and watch a movie as if you were watching a a you know a fifty foot screen at a at a movie theater right\nUp but it ... and there I have been a couple of people who have ... couple of companies that have tried to do that but it never took off and I think one reason is even now we are goggles the best we are goggles you can buy are still\nIs probably the one I Would recommend\n[noise] no I don't know uh it can you still buy Panasonic into us\nAh yes Blu ray players yes TVs no they've gotten out of the TV business in the U.S but they're big in Europe and Asia\nSeem I don't know why since you've got a Sony TV you should just get a Sony\nWell that there is some a logic to that absolutely yeah absolutely yeah\nI was looking at a they have three models currently a day ... Dawson the ex eight hundred on seven hundred\nAnd um but I was ... because I was looking the specs or on the website and uh I was not a hundred percent certain that they were going to be able to support old age the art form I was particularly the ones that do um dynamic HD are\n... and all those those two are Dolby Vision and ... and plus and the uh I'm pretty sure Sony is not on board with ... plus\nUh I Know Panasonic is sounds like Panasonic\nPanasonic D. P. you be eight twenty is the model number\nLast ... last week you mentioned perhaps saw a with a child from about empire near a ...\nYou know I yeah I just saw that they I just saw an email that they had come out with a new player and I haven't looked at it yet so I Can't really tell you that you know recommended or not yet 'cause I haven't looked at it but um they did come out with a new one let me see if I can find it real quick here I'm\n... and plus is a Samsung thing to some it is Sonia to master class habits or uh you know the masters series you know he does not ... you're not in a it's a Samsung so there's no point in worrying about\nThat right exactly exactly okay yeah those ...\nI wanted to know if I'm\nYou know the way that Sony implement saw H. D. R. S. is a little bit different than how ... L G ... also like they have at this great a chip for a\nYou know do we vacation on the older\nAnd a sunny and also like to uh software so like they have a very powerful um you know cheap said and uh the interest so for a for an update there wouldn't be able to play a\nLow vision an older formats do you think that's going to be something that they will implement a it but they ... implement I'm In the future um\nDo you mean do you mean uh like HD are ten plus right\nYeah they could whether or not they will is a is an undergrad real problem because you know Samsung makes its they're ten plus so Sony's that can implement it so ... vision because ... I mean there's no no so so does the Amazon doesn't support ... that's correct that is\nSo that is really have to I mean it's crazy\nCrazy crazy it is and it sounds like the answer your question though Glen is get that Panasonic with that nice Sony\nTV oh man that Sony TV is going to be awesome yeah that's really really good\nIt's it's just nuts what ... what a you know why do they yeah to a guy\nYeah you know I don't know I Wish I did you know there's there's format wars there's all kinds of weird stuff about like as you say Samsung for some reason just did not want to adopt Dolby Vision everybody else did but they didn't know\nAnd so now whether own however any of them is going to look pretty good rice really good okay I mean you know if it is tiny difference\nOh well there's I think there's a difference between W vision and HD our tent which do you like better they'll be there's no question\nOkay no question so I'm I'm looking here I I don't ... I'm looking at the the specs of the Sony you you'd be P.

I have the platinum card 'cause that gets me to the century lounges and the delta ...\nUm [noise] I use a city card I use a Berkley's arrivals Kurd a ton of them do I mean just any time you look at a credit card or get a credit card I always recommend actually having at least two when you travel\nUm do they are they all use the same exchange rate so those kind of standard or do they kind of make a little money on the side by making the exchange rate less favorable\nI don't know about the different credit cards but you know what kind of bummed me out and heritage is big culprit of this I was in\nHarrods you know a couple of weeks ago ... store in London oh it's amazing yeah but and other stores do it too but harrod's they say you know but when you when you when they swipe your car to pay and they know that you're American they go oh would you like to play in US dollars\nIt's a fantastic system the only thing I Would say is consider a smaller screen because remember you can always attach\nIt desktop screen and have even more real estate get a twenty seven inch desktop screen on that thing and then that gives you a little more portability so when you get to the desk you can plug it in but if you really want to seven C. Seventeen inches is a lot for a laptop it's not a lot for a desktop you see what I'm saying\nIt's gonna yeah I'm not going to use it for ... for\nThe you're never going to pick it up okay that is a that was a great deal highly recommend it\nRather seldom yeah but you know a ... my my thing is a this other lead over that I'm competing with instead of having a shoe or what was\nI Love the dual drive I think that's a great thing okay and what Lenovo will often do instead of that is put extra battery life 'cause\nWe're noble often focuses on sometimes they'll even have dual batteries instead of dual hard drives so he says you're not ever on plugging this thing you don't care what the battery life is ... yeah and I'll tell you right now the battery life on this thing is not going to be good\nAt all but you don't care to bother yeah that doesn't bother yeah\nNow I'm not actually delivered oh we'll probably it's not a dog because it says sixteen gigabytes of memory five well as as the as ... as\nYou know that's all there is that's all that's in there yeah yeah which was that\nJust sort of well I guess you can do a ... which which Lenovo is that a flex\nOkay yeah I'd say well go with the Dell the boy in every respect that screen other one other thing you might want to add and always keep this in line especially since this is a\nBusiness laptop is support and free support is worthless as everybody knows these days and that's how they got the prices down on these that laptop would've cost more than twice as much ten years ago\nBecause they bundled in great support so keep in mind that you can buy from an oval or Dell better support and think\nAbout that as well that's another well it's a few hundred dollars extra it might be worth it if you don't want to support yourself now I I I rarely call support because I'm the tech guy you know I don't\nBut but you're using this in business and if you think you're going to need support or at any point want support I Would consider getting a higher in a support packages well\nWell this is coming from Costco gang costs are says they have two years or ... what do you think about\nYeah ... where it's actually pretty good [noise] but I think about buying it costs goes they have a very good return policy\nSo they have a ... I think it's for three months\nYeah so if you really if you are in any doubt buying at a Costco means you know you could try it for a few months and see if you like it and ... and return it at at no cost now when you tell me that that tells me it's not it's not the latest in spring Cosco\nThe big box stores tend to sell slightly older models that will will will sell the newer models on their site and give the big box stores older models or slightly modified models that is a tank 'cause I think is a tank and it it's a great price for a lot of hardware you're getting a graphics processors well that's great\nBut being if I sat with on a generation that doesn't that get lots of pretty much the latest\nOr it is actually that's the that's the latest processor um [noise] it's a little confusing because intel has released for eight generation processor yes it's been eight\nAnd eight eights again and then they again and again so it's probably the early it's probably a year old but that's you know for me that's all that's not old for most people that's fine\nYeah that doesn't bother me at that now with all honesty you think I should skip all this and goes either get to apple [noise]\nThat's a more personal decision because it's a if you're used to windows going the Macintosh means re learn you know learning a few things your muscle memory is going to change\nA I Am a Mac fan but it also means some of the software that you might be using it fits windows only is not you know you're going to not be happy with that and absolutely that a laptop of that quality from apple of that you know of that capability what's costs twice as much\nBut it might well if I\nDon't even make dual Dr laptops at all yeah it's\nGoing to be something smaller about being an apple I guess I Would have to say to myself this is good enough to\nKnow if you like windows I haven't windows tennis is pretty darn secure these days I wouldn't worry about it\nYeah okay All right so just this year there's a show that\nYes go for it and then call me in three months to see if somebody if they're there is anything you don't like about it I'd love to know\nIt you know I looked at the review is people that have habits that pretty much happy with it yeah\nI think it's a good I think tell makes excellent hardware\nExcept a couple of people they open up from the get go do the work\nWell it yeah and of course that's true of all hard where you know the way solid state hardware works either works for [laughter] forever or fails independently so if you can get it to ... but you know and that's the beauty of a three month return policy bang on it hard the first three months I mean really use it\n[noise] where do I use it as this during the day I have like five six seven different eyes open on my screen and I'm looking forward to read I see I deal with customers I got to show them the right and what what I click on either has to offer the formula either\nWay this is what he said eight gigs of ram\nA okay I think the exit ramp sixteen\nSixteen even better that'll be that is you have a\nSpeedy laptop my friend and a good warranty from Cosco I'd say get it\nAnd enjoy it and let me know what you think our show today brought to you by remote PC this might be something you want to get as well [noise]\nThe ability to access your work computer from home or vice versa Mac or PC you could even access at using a mobile device that's where most PC it's easy it's fast it's secure it's the closest thing to tell a boarding and if you have office computers you'll love the price\nIt's a less than six dollars a month to connect up to ten\nTutors if you do support for anybody right somebody does support for you that's a really nice tool you can access the computer remotely fix it and get on with your life now did I say less than six dollars a month for ups in computers how 'bout Ninety percent off if you use a ...

time\nFor all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know but they do and I just have a more\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled at\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nNo end to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually\nHad to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more than just a question and that would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThirty okay but you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab your your your second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance you're canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh bye hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot thirty nine homes or we when we bought a house um where was given a gives me a faith than are\nThat are limited what we could do a lot and what we can do with our home\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that\nEach of the homes has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation but what happened was a developer got to the city of Ventura or the city approved the flooding of the lot\nAnd now the developer is building two homes that are in violation of that cc in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record the\nRecord on who you are you what you do is\nYou get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the H a weight also can control\nAnd they can say no more than one lied or one home ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you\nViolating liability or to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney a it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use\nAnd there are a attorneys out there than in fact represent nothing but H always [noise] okay\nSo you get to go just go on the go on the Internet and check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell especially if you're building additional home such big money for them\nAlright max\nHi good morning Yasser historically horse [laughter] okay but yet you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I should never heard that one before ever ... much about it for\nA while now anyway anyway they shorted me based on the estimate based committed they shorted me eight hundred thousand dollars\nA call him a couple of times especially when they told me to go on it that is anyway anyway when I did I filed and small claims court treat other Ninety seven dollars and admittedly but it came with a check for five hundred\nAnd the verbiage on the trucks as if I could check that me gay truly claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I took a check\nBecause I Know in ... in court if I take that check me gate\nYeah yeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would sell is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and kick their bodies to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and file and small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm gonna\nGo good luck and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works because normally they would kick it right up to superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of a a a judge a small claims judge which are usually not judge has a and daddy is and this happens all the time would be companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly\nHowever there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage\nBy dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're going to lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash the check [noise] this is handling the [noise]\n\n\nThis is

your ...\nUh I got a question from talking now get back to being concerned about my computer\nYeah [noise] I'm looking for ... for an application or it will allow me to edit the excess meditate up on the photo oh yeah\nI went through a wicked petey is comparison tried all their suggestions and was not impressed with any of them\nYeah so I'm willing I'm willing to pay for a commercial applications but I just want one\nThey will allow me to edit the copy\nOf the comments section you know there's just so I can so\nDescribe what the picture is and then be able to go search for certain key words you know in in the comments of the data\nFairly a simple thing to do all photos taken on cameras have something called an extended information tags their fields E. X. I. F.\nThat whole things like the location data that's turned on a date and time of capture stuff like that and there's even further standard called I. P. T. see that as a comes from the wire agencies that can allow you to do even more data titles and ... and all sorts of stuff\nThere's another uh you know a\n... there's other information in there besides just the photo like icy see information so all of this is a is great uh information and most photo library programs will automatically import that data and use it\nYou could sort by date and so forth sometimes if you've got tags and there you can do searching\nI met her I don't know have you tried photo me\n[noise] a\nTry this one it's free so I like it it's from Germany and you know the Germans do good stuff\nWell if if I Would like to I went through ... and I cried about a dozen of them so I very well\nCould you might have it it's a fairly old one I haven't used it in a while but in fact I think I hate to say at\nThe ... in that might be for windows me which would be a terrible terrible thing I don't know what I what I typically will do is do it within light room 'cause that's what I used to process my photos and it has gives you access to all the ex if they were alive\nI own light room I guess one of these days I'll have to learn how to use\nThat kind of a a ... a a candidate should a horse fly I [laughter] I don't think you need to just for ... anybody in the chat room have a a a favored or exit editor I Would try this photo meets photo meat dot D. E.\n[noise] um I've also used I'm trying to remember I don't think I've used on windows it might be on the Mac but there are a number of programs that let you quickly import raw images because light room is very bad at a raw and I've used a program called fast\nRaw viewer and I'm pretty sure yes for windows as well now it's not free but I'm pretty sure fast raw viewer will also let you modify the uh the taxi ex if taxes and\nSo you can try before you buy it's fast raw viewer dot com and that is kept up to date that is a very up to date program\nAnd the reason I like it is because light room is so slow yeah my raw photos on some of my cameras or forty two megabytes they're very very big files and so a PR image so it takes a while for like a new loaded and debris split fast reviewers designed to really get you to quickly go through your photos\nAnd uh and pick the ones you liked but it also gives you full access to the P. T. C. and the access data so I think that would be even though it's not maybe this is the problem is that we keep pd listing is specifically ex if editors but almost all good photo processing tools I think will also give you access to the access information\nBut I guess I'm gonna have to break down by camera they only digital camera I got ... you\nKnow there's ... there's a look at J. pigs as well yet has batch editing of I. P. T. C. data what are the things I use this for is uh I like to put in to all the images I import from my camera I like to put in my name address\nCopyright information and stuff like that and this will do it in a batch format so you can have a standard kind of tanks that you put in\nTry fast rub your you know I don't think you have to have raw files to\nTo use it uh and it will let you do some sorting I Believe by tags by a by the tanks that you put into the access so that was one of the things you wanted to do that is another one too so there's ... there's the uh uh what was the forgotten the name\nThe Emmy program phone Emmys it I Can't remember now and uh and then fast raw viewer photo me this photo me dot D. E. cars from Germany and fast raw viewer and anybody who has a suggestion you could call or you could put it in a chat room or you can go to the website tech guy labs dot com and\nAdd it as a comment or just you know you could just it's free to comment free to visit to say I have an answer for James I know\nLet's go to Rhode Island Chris is on the line hello Chris\n[noise] pay ... Rhode Island nice to see you welcome [laughter] your memory short is\nIt's there before you get into it and and at first responders know how to do it the problem is there's so many different Android phones and the rules for how to do this very depending on which the Android\nPhone you have I think that is a big deal [noise] um I don't know if there's a standard way to do it anymore they're used to be on handwriting or they're in the early days [noise] uh\nYou know I'm One way to do it in in you and you and you this will depend very much much Andrea they have Samsung's for instance have owner an owner info section\nThat when the phone is locked will scroll across the wrong and at least that would give them some information or you can also in a Samsung phone update your profile and the contacts happened you'll notice there's medical information\nIn there and then you can also a set ice emergency contacts I think that's their by default and Samsung phones\nSo you want to add that it's very important but but look at the lock screen message most if not all unfortunately many Android phones have a lock screen message and you could put information there if nothing else\nPut a a contact phone number because as I said the first responders that's the thing that they tell me that they and if you're a first responder\nUh let me know if I'm wrong on this but I've talked to a couple and they said look what we really want is that emergency contact number\nSo at the very least you know put that in your lock screen message you could say ice in a phone number and people will know what that means the first responders will now\nAnd if you don't have that feature the one last thing you can do and this is true on any phone you know you have a lock screened image the thing that shows up you can use it at a photo editor without lock screen image it puts them information they're now remember everybody available to everybody will be able to see that\nBut ah so you're you know consider that but uh almost ... almost any from ... screen imaging at the very least you could do you know in just if you do I see that in case of emergency people know what that means and then a phone number that's getting Ninety percent of the way they're long as that person was\nLabs or I should just do my friends to get an iPhone\nYeah yeah this is something Apple's done really really well I'm a I Wish I ... I don't know you know handwriting premise Android is not unlike Iowa not a unified ecosystem is lots of different Android phones and lots of different ways to do it [noise] so on the iPhone it's this summer\nThe summer I was at amusement park and an older coaster and my phone started ringing so when I when I got off I went and looked at it and it was a local call and I thought what made it as my hotel I better call it so I called and I get the police\nAnd they said we just had an emergency calls from this phone wow and I said oh my God no I just had it in my pocket you know I must\nHave done it I'm so sorry who's the rollercoaster hey [laughter] she goes are you on the intimidate or I Do yes I Am she goes oh good our GPS [laughter]\nThey knew exactly where you were and you know they probably are going down the hill it's scary\nEnough you could have had a heart attack on that thing I maybe they maybe [laughter] maybe they knew yeah they are yeah I boy I'm you're exactly right tell everybody you know and everybody in your men's group\nThat is a very especially as we get to a certain age that's a very important thing to have on there as you're in case of emergency information [noise]\nUh but unfortunately with Android phones is no single way to do it as so Samsung phones do have a way and other phones if you at least in the lock screen put it in a large screen message or on the screen as a as text\nWhy ...\nMy pleasure I'm a look here's somebody saying\n[noise] uh I'm all look on my pixel phone which is kind of the default um Android phone\nTo me saying that they also have an ice entry under contacts some of the search for I see you know all I'm getting is ice cream stores", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "28"}
