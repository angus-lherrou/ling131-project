it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are in China I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job pointing out the

incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nGovernor out I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what

hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again I mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah and I I mean [laughter] I\nDon't have real don't drunk principal is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater is a conscious of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me

investigators found the chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process to officials say by operatives from ... to the People's Liberation army\nIn super micro China's spies appeared to offend a perfect conduit for what U.S officials now describes the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against U.S companies except\nThey're all denying it now\nThey're all denying it now they're saying what is Bloomberg Businessweek talking about Bloomberg Businessweek quoted numerous sources in the intelligence community and at Amazon and apple but they didn't quote him by name\nVery common practice\nSomebody in the intelligence community isn't going to say hey it's me they're going to go to Bloomberg Businessweek and say look this is\nA deep\nThere's a variety of phrases though use the background off the record sometimes they'll just say and I think this is the case here you can use this please do\nWe want the world it out but don't don't quote me one official from the again U.S intelligence community according to Bloomberg Businessweek you know what I keep saying that says investigators found it eventually affected almost thirty companies\nIncluding a major bank government contractors in the world's most valuable company apple apple had planned to order get this more than thirty thousand thirty thousand super micro servers\nIn two years for a global network of data centers three senior insiders and apple according to Bloomberg Businessweek said in the summer of twenty Fifteen it to found malicious chips on super micro mother boards apple severed ties with super micro the following year\nAnd that we know is true that fact but for what apple says was unrelated reasons okay so that's\nThat's the story explosive story that came out of Thursday the next day apple Amazon super Mike Rowe and the Chinese government\nStrenuously denied the allegations apple released a statement later in the day as super micro\n\nIt is it is a bizarre and for those of us on the outside in comprehensible\nConflict\nBloomberg Businessweek is a very reliable source and frankly I credit there's they're reporting there's you're not going to get reporting for a variety of different companies and the U.S intelligence community that that's the ... the same\nLie so what's ... what's going on [noise]\nAnd uh I'm I'm I'm reading an article by Zach would occur for a tech crunch who covers cyber security and national security has done it for five years including at CBS\nHe says even with this story my gut is mixed ...

lucky\n\n[noise] naturally would occur rights people are skeptical of this by chip story on one side you have Bloomberg's decades long stellar reputation of reporting ac human\nThoroughly research story citing more than a dozen sources some inside government some out and publishing enough evidence to present a convincing case on the other side of the sources are anonymous\nProbably 'cause this was classified so accountability is difficult and then you have the denials from the companies themselves\n\nBut would occur points out these are not bullet proof an outright rejection of the stories claims they're subject to legal counsel and government regulation\nSo what to believe I I Wish I could tell you I don't know and I don't think anybody knows\nI have\nIs just it seems highly unlikely to me that Bloomberg would have independent sources at a variety of places are reporting the same story if it weren't true if it weren't true\n[laughter] so I get I guess that's what I'm going with [laughter]\nBut\nEr\nAll is not clear here all is not clear what do you think maybe maybe hey are you an insider at a a three letter agency over there and clean Virginia tell me what should we believe\nYou know I think uh I think maybe the details aren't as important as the fact that we know this kind of stuff is probably happening most of what we use is made in China the problem is it's

R. T. TVs yeah use phosphorus yeah well this is the same sort of deal there the blue laser hits a foster which generates yellow light and yellow light can actually\nBe split into green and red\nYellow was blue and green no it's blue and green and red or blue and green when it's reflective when it's transmitted to correct It's blue it's yellow and read a it's green and red color although I'm like hey I Know I Know\nBut basically if you have a yellow something that is missing yellow light yeah that can be split into red\nAnd green okay so they've got the blue from the laser ... and then the yellow foster which is then emitting yellow yellow which is then split into reading reading rain so they've got red green and blue which are the three calls you need to do the entire correct color spectrum correct and the help he normally use is why the LAPD he's for the like what are they your limo\nOr fluorescent all in a in a project or they use a either a ultra high pressure lamp those are the things that burned out yes correct and and in short order too and you have to replace them at at a cost of a hundred or two or three hundred on what advantage of lasers is they last a long time very long to they're typically rated like twenty thousand hours okay\nWhich at eight hours a day is I forget exactly but a year year and many many years yeah\nSo this new one actually I was pretty impressed with the single laser but the colors were slightly washed out this new one has two lasers\nCorrect it has a blue blazer and a red light so it's red is more accurate well it's it's I wouldn't exactly call it more accurate we did a lot of measuring writer it is certainly brighter no question about that and it's very deep bread it is a very saturated\nRead yeah I was looking at a stretch and that can yesterday\nAnd I was at a but I have to say that you have you calibrated it mhm so we I think we had it on the ... did you calibrate it on a friday on a Thursday night yes there's as I came in friday morning mhm 'cause I had to see this hundred inches yeah folks if you've never had a hundred and screener house you'll get a sense of\nThe good news is this screen it is a fold up there's ways to\nGet it in the house right yeah I'm sure must role you don't have to yeah because you don't have to unfold she'll ... that we want to increases no no no but you can roll it up you don't have to take the roof of the house that's right [laughter] which which you know I mean it's bigger than your door in some case in some ... in certain directions yeah\nMean the point of this whole TV this late they call it a laser t._v. they want it to be a TV replacement right so they say okay I think about buying a hundred inch LCD TV or ... or\nSo hundreds of thousands or hundreds hundred thousand dollars or more easily 'cause I've seen them I mean sure Adam and yeah yeah plus they way hundreds of pounds they had to move it in a seven\nForty the belly yeah the origin that original yes on a hundred and something inch plasma yeah exactly I showed it on Regis and Kelly yeah in the day [laughter] [noise] well\nIn this case um it's so much easier the screen is obviously just ways a few pounds and no big deal you can hang\nIt on a wall easily we had I did hear it is studio yeah it's kind of like a project or ... a little more solid and it's kinda like a projectors but then you put this ultra short throw projector eight inches from the wall and then you don't have to worry about walking in the beam of the product or lie you don't even need\nTo be a in a dark room it's really intended to be a living room TV\nPlus a off angle viewing yet remarkable you might actually have at the side of the screen and that's still looks full color so there's two laser I was really impressed with I thought it was it was much\nBetter it looks really good it does it uh so basically you you still you have this red laser that produces a red light and the blue laser still hits a yellow phosphorus from which green is extracted so you still get red green and blue\nAnd uh but you get better read get certainly get better read right at risk for example the YouTube a logo or the Netflix logo which is red\nMan that read through ... wow I Know it's your turn to read down a little bit we did [laughter] [laughter] 'cause I was watching the\nAnd ask your wife she'll tell you [laughter]\nOh no no that's to yellow of a white man who blew avoid exactly exactly\nI have a wife so what you want is there's a there's a very clearly defined standard for what the color of white that was used when the content was created a so the movie producers of the ... movie a color wrists and the director all get together around a reference monitor\nThat has been calibrated to be a particular color of white and to have particular colors are red green and blue\nIt's not always white white it could be a\nMore I ... yeah warmer white I Know it could um although again there's this there's a standard\nYeah but they don't always use it I remember in the godfather ... the cinematographer took the film the exposed film and dragged through T he wanted to make it [laughter]\nI ever heard of that at that time I was in very nerve wracking thing because I wasn't I had to do it to the exposed the shot filmed them don't mailman\nSo if I somehow screwed it up there goes the movie but there is it now and in recent uh uh you know read\nThe ... of it they they've corrected it a little dark and gloomy right that's right but uh that we want remember that first scene in the godfather where he's sitting in his office mansion and it's his daughter's wedding day and yeah ... you know ... ... ...\nA very dark and gloomy scene and then the original it's almost ... you would like it\n[laughter] a dark [laughter] as long as I was watching it on a ...\nOr you can barely see anything I'd like to see it now in an HD are ... there have been re masters I ... yeah there are a little bit less dark and I don't know if\nI I Know that for instance for a couple of the director wasn't involved in the rematch drink so I don't know [noise] and I as a tricky\nThing isn't it when the original director or the visionary who came up with the movie isn't involved in the re mastering right how do you know you're still remaining true to the creators content\nSo that just graders and one that shows is ... what white ... or so it's not a ... he doesn't just they will use pan tone zero\nNo it's a it's a standard that technically is called the sixty five okay a which is a a point on a graph that is in the white area of all the different colors that we can that\nWe can see you've ever seen and you can Google was a color gamut Sean ...\nOtherwise known as C I e ... diagram\n[laughter] and it looks a it looks like a triangle most of the time and I definitely like a triangle each point being red green and blue ... the the points of the triangle being red green and blue and so that's what they're messing with ...\nAnd and then there's the white point in the center of the dry yeah where'd that white pointed and exactly where that why point isn't exactly where those red green and blue points are determines how the you know what the picture will look like when you're\nWhen you're calibrating though do you know well I guess you have some source material that you know that it's calibrated to\nWell you again there are standards and the software that we use which is called Cal man from Spector Cal a has that been programmed in so basically you see on the screen a little chart\nAnd it shows you where the white point is and then if you move the controls in the TV around\nYou see that point actually move around is that the first thing he fixes get point yes the white point is the first thing you get correct and you have to get a correct not only at one luminous level but at all of them and it's less from dark the bright right because the white point at twenty percent or twenty\nPercent of a peak white has to be the same color of white as eighty percent wow\nUh so you do the ... the gray scale what's called the gray scale you do that first and then you do the colors and once you get those all set up then you start looking at real content and see how it looks wow\nSo that's why I take some time yeah\nAnd you don't trust your eyes no\nNo because everybody's eyesight is a little different right and so what I see as a particular color you'll look at it and say well it's a slightly different color to me\nSo the the the software and hardware what he does is harder like attached to the screen no it it it's a meter it's sort of like I Am right screamed at the screen and the old days you'd see with computer screens people would calibrate them ... I used to call on screen soccer's they would just yeah right on the screen\nRight the the spiders ... apple yeah yeah there and there are those with a direct view screen that you just [noise] they slap\nRight onto the screen and they do and then you can have the lights on with a with a meter that you're farther away or I was going to turn off all the lights which is why we did it at night yeah because really dark yeah that studio you'd have to worry there's no there's no windows well that's true [laughter] except there's there is a port hole in the low you're\nRight in ...

I don't know why ...\n... and in the end he hung up on me you're seeing never be mean to Johnny jet [laughter] okay so what is the foliage in the Smoky Mountains really beautiful I guess it must be\nWell it's actually not it it it just the Smoky Mountains actually have developed this website oh it's I mean it's just a promotional tour for them but it's you you don't you want to use it for

okay ah ... mountains dot com slash\nFall dash foliage dash map\nThat yes [noise] um so actually and it's you know saying that New York state is really um at its peak oh man I'm ready to do any miner or but\nYou know I still think there's a little bit more time I actually be interesting to read the chat room after this to see what they think of it if it's accurate for where they live I Know you have a lot of people on the east coast all over so it's a little\nLighter on here that shows so the peak the best time is the kind of dark red and uh so yeah this is going to be the next couple of weeks are going to ...\nIt'd be the the peak time in New England so if you're planning if you want to see the leaves and it's a magical experience if you if you've never witnessed it before and I know a lot of my friends in Southern California it really has no so we don't know anything about it yeah\nJust the plug here it could just\nBe somebody needs to test it at the plug absolutely and then you know it's not expensive get electrician out and uh and it's not it's inexpensive putting even and you might ask about this whole house surge suppression\nCaught it or not there's but maybe it is there and are in their problem maybe there are little sound is coming down the line if there are whole home surged pressure protects everything in the home but I have to tell you it off the\nRails protect her strength or something\nAnd often brands surge protector ... there's not even a brand name on it you probably got it at the Home Depot you know in Iraq\nRight yeah yeah and I got to do nothing oh [laughter] hang in there and now I Know yeah\nSo if it really if you're worried about power problems what you want is a power conditioning surge suppressor\nSo not one of those little sheep basically it's an extension cable with five plugs into that one of them it's Syria does it's got a few but uh\nYou can get and they'll have it'll have a battery in it because we all do you'll be running off the battery and it will condition the power to a clean sine wave and it will catch surges it will also catch and this is also a problem for hardware low power\n[noise] yes that's okay I just some guy said he is and I'm not so big will grow rises or drops but it could be in here you know so I have a great day he's gone to jail\nBy the way a good one if you plug it in [noise] maybe get one they're now they're not cheap they're gonna be a couple of hundred bucks but you've spent some money on that I ...\nYeah my time and I mean the amount of time span yeah just switching stuff from one ... to the other is in Seoul\nYeah so I think it probably will ... yeah it's probably worth getting that condition or um I like trip flight ... like just lights one ape PCC is another\nI'm Stacy and the one I most recently a God that I'm I really liking I put my um [noise] ... network attach storage on it\nBecause uh right because it is a you know that I really\nDon't want to lose that and I got one that I really like from site it's called cyber power [noise] cyber power cyber power and I'll just tell you what's the model number is because uh I don't remember off the top of my head but because I Believe I bought it on Amazon I should be able to find it fairly quickly yes here's you know from\nThe cyber power a it is a ... now what you gotta do is figure out how much ... why did you need because the batteries to protect that but this thing wasn't too expensive is a hundred bucks the CPA twenty five a VR LCD intelligent LCD UPS system\nNow this isn't really a yeah it's not really a superpower conditioner but but it certainly will protect from surges and uh and low power a really\nClear what it is right I mean three IMAX than a month it's its power right\n[noise]\nYeah probably [laughter]\nProbably I mean it could be static as well but that would be a highly unlikely do you have yeah you have cats\nNow a rabbit hole actually rabbits don't ever let the rabbit in your office or we don't she don't get the L E they will eat how our cable trust me they either have a dead Mac or frequency rabbit\nYeah I prefer the rabbit\nGo quite [laughter] why [laughter] haven't rabbits their kids [laughter] no kidding\nOh yeah I had a we had a pet that money and I let it in my office and they love their number of rodents love a power cable and I don't know why but they'll do not\nGet shot ... how did and then I didn't I didn't know it just killed the power didn't didn't kill the money [laughter] and I confess perhaps having some bad thoughts at that point\nYes yes I Do to cyber power ... eight twenty five and is one you were like\nYou have some reason I got it is also talks to the ... and lets it no oh we've lost power is shut down and there's a lot of television but it it does\nLine that could get it on line Amazon\nYeah it's on Amazon for Ninety seven bucks it does offer a simulated sine wave output\nWhich is going to clean up your power a little bit but most importantly is going to give you a real surge protection I have to be honest with the heat is no surge suppressor that is less than a lot can really protect your stuff but in most cases they come with insurance that you know\nWhat has insurance that's why I bought it I'm not a\nWell see if you can get them to give you two to pony up\nI'm yeah I'm going to try to ensure map or make me hold but not ... not going to do this forever you know\nYeah it's it's probably at this point they'll say you know dude [laughter]\nYeah that's apple rude and use your apple care yeah I bought the apple chair\nBow that was smart you can't you know that was really that forever you know I Would check I honestly uh spend a hundred bucks on a an electrician no problem come out and check the plugs\nYeah yeah we're going to do that to be a\nProblem for other devices to if you've got a good\nYeah well I had the yet that's what's so old is the House's new no it's a condo probably twenty five years old so he went around and ask neighbors you know have they have problems nope no not that we can find out about the guy that lived here before us was an electrician so you know\nYour debit only need electricity in there [laughter] oh he was messing with it for sure something no electricity and could just sit and let the way that oh he's required at all I guarantee down and mechanics\nCar one time and that was about [laughter] sided with the well maintain yeah no it was not\nNow no what happened for sure [laughter] I said oh yeah you you bought an electrician house you got some interest in there\nSo all of them a guy out to check it inside I Would get conditioner no matter what\nYeah yeah I always I mean you got to have that that's just to get okay these things are too expensive to just let them or you know\nNobody knows that the surge protectors are you ... if nothing\nElse they're not they're not cheap ones aren't really worth anything you need something with about yeah yeah well not know

it to see if they could modify these things and get the thing back working and they could\nBut this software exists a S T too and it's only provided the apple stores and a and a few select authorized apple service providers that under under strict confidentiality in business contracts mandating what parts they use and what they charge apple says his protect you and actually\nThat's believable it's credible it is to protect you but it has the very real side effect of\nKeeping people from repairing their stuff apple\nFor instance you know there are a lot of iPhone repair companies out there aren't there\nUm but apple won't sell them parts so they have to get parts from old iPhones or third parties and their as you probably remember the the fingerprint readers\nOn iPhones if the screen was replaced it involves replacing the fingerprint reader and there was a fairly significant apple problem a bug where if that had happened\nTo the ... the phone wouldn't run anymore apple said oh no that was about we didn't mean that when they get when it happened and fixed it\nBut they really don't like third party repair shops\nThey use secret tool kits both software and hardware they make special machines it goes way back to the beginning Steve\nJobs didn't want anybody to get into a Macintosh so used proprietary torque screws you had to have a special Turks screwdriver uh unfortunately\nThat was easy to do ... and the people were able to get into their max pretty quickly but Steve didn't want to get in there I mean he really they and they got more and more\nAdamant about that and you couldn't make the case it was about security at that time they just want to they just want to keep the repairs to themselves\n[noise] so I fix it to their credit did this risk display replacement on one of the new twenty Eighteen ... pros with such bar to see if they could to\nRun it normally and after they replaces screen it did run fine so if apple has this capability seems like they do they haven't yet pushed it and the reason I bring it up\nIs not to not to do some sensationalistic things\nSaying oh apples going to keep her from prepared repairing it but just to let you know and maybe let encourage you to lead apple know that this would be a problem\nIf they did in many state legislatures I Can't remember if it was twenty states are looking at rights to repair legislation to protect your right to repair stuff you own\nTo make sure that companies offer you manuals and parts if you go to repair dot org\n... you can find that information if you Google right to repair you'll find a wired magazine article that came out last month John Deere just caused farmers\nSwindled farmers out of their right to repair it says in wired magazine a lot of companies make a lot of money on repairs\nBut shouldn't you be allowed to fix your own stuff after all you on it right\nIt's a very it's an interesting debate\nAnd ah and I I Hope that apple I would like to encourage apple to make third party repairs possible because apple often doesn't want to fix stuff you remember our caller last hour three IMAX fry on him and what apple said as well we'll have to replace the whole mother board it's six hundred dollars\nMaybe that is true or maybe there was some small part that could easily be fixed but apple doesn't want to get in their ...\nThey don't want to do that and a lot of companies nowadays that's how it works it's all modular replacement\nWhich makes it expensive and incidentally encourages you to buy a new iMac which this guy did write repaired out or if you want to learn more about the rights to repair and which states\nThere's a lot of them now wow it's almost every state wow [noise] [noise] ah have have have legislation a along these

D tech guy\nDe da da da\nDu line to line two is Paul and Lake Forest California Hello Paul\nHello Neal thanks for hanging on\nYes so what I have is a I have two devices connected hardwired to my router okay\nOne of the PC one of the laughs [noise] in a while ago it was having a problem that appeared to be connected to my VPN provider with my computer would just drop off the networks for no reason and then a suddenly be back on later for no apparent\nReason either yeah\nBut so what I was about what happened is one of them are trying to solve I swapped some cables around just to see if the other networks cable at work and now mine now is is nowhere to be found\n[laughter] well I think the new cable doesn't work for sure but I just lump\nIt back and forth and now it's like oh wow that's interesting\nDid are always works there Peter always works as a net number does as it's got a red light on the powers which that says I'm not working\nOh and so it doesn't have to do with the network it's just an ass stopped working but could be yeah the red light telling you I don't think the red light has to do with the network that sounds like it has to do with other as\nWell there are a lot of different things than the red like tell you the\nManual they need more light confined in order to know what\nIt is you have to log on to the dashboard\nOut what you can't do right can you can you connect uh let's see what can you do hear who makes the gas\nIs a WD it's there when they were there when I might\nNot my favorite a company in the world\nUm western digital but we should do is to find these terms real quickly western digital makes something called a lot of companies make these network attached storage it's basically a full computer\nBut it has some yeah national attributes mainly lots of drives and lots of store just why western digital into businesses cells drives\nBut it also lacks a computer screen or a keyboard or a mouse it but if\nYou connected to your network and then you ... you can to get on it by a logging in from some other computer on the network and usually it's used for data storage whether it's backup surfing movies and music uh but there are other things in asking do I use my asked for a lot of things and I love it yeah but I'm not that fond of the western digital how old is it\nLess than a year\nThat's really dumb that they put one light on this goes red and they say well if you want to know what it means go to the dashboard\nWell is what it means is my network interface has died [noise] yeah it's\nOne of the day that it has to either not port yeah so if you if you had a switch that could do that sort of thing you can uh loews yeah double\nCrew that's not unusual masses the exactly what you have but neither one of the health neither is working uh let me think could you direct connect it to a laptop\nI'm I'm wonder if you do as\nWell um see here\nYou might try if that if you have a laptop with the dashboard software on it\n[noise] um well only ... ... ... laptop that\nYou know that even that port on it and I had an ... you know it is it worth up or not yet\n[noise] yeah well that that that would be one thing or even a desktop and even with a long wire but I Would try and connecting directly instead of through the router\nUm yeah and if you connect and run the dashboard software I Would think it should find the western digital and maybe give you some information on on what's wrong I I Am western digital masses\nFail at a higher rate I think than than most yeah\nWell the reason I think this particular western digital 'cause it was supposedly have\nThat's bill built in trans go\nFor your server oh that's neat so as as a server it was you know highly recommend it oh yeah that's neat yeah so\nUsually network attach storage devices do have they have processors they have to they're running an operating system and everything but normally they very slow process or so it sounds like western digital said hey it'd be a good thing if we put a faster processor or maybe even a chip designated a D. S. P. chip designated to do transcribing for flex\nThe new the new it said what we bought it and so it just starts all over again\nIt's such a bond that what they called me I don't\nKnow if I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... collection is\nOkay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report\nYes absolutely and it will go on and it's still on the credit report correct\nOkay you can't forget about the collection agencies are they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or or as I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah\nThe next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports that's that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively having no credit especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years\nI've been dropping from the credit report and what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone by it's crazy all I\nAgree it's crazy yeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients\nWho had ah the issue or when these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example for non paper to Crump a credit card or any written a contract and a credit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real ...\nAgencies have called and people know there was a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years to go there is a forty year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they change the law last month it's now a ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my clients said okay just send me just give me the code just told me ... tell me the PIN number let me look it up right now\nIf I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh\nYou know that's sort of thing kind of horrible ruled out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole just I think it's going to be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit but\nIt's a it has to explode just has to explode All right Paul Paul you're up welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old in a clothing store and a quarter high on the repairs and walked up to the girl checked the items [noise] oh she checked committed something I'm not sure what she did she handed the\nGarments doctor she went and tried in common than taught them how to step device without the cover and its laughter scratch your leg\nYeah Eighteen Inches blue or anything there\nI mean is there anything there are I mean he told me about the scratch or was the was the femoral Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out there is a\nNo no I wasn't I was thinking more of a the stress and we went through we\nAll know no ... no one cares about your stress that vote\nFor an aids test we had to have her tips\nFor HP ... wait a second an aids test because one of those security devices scratched her and you did an aids test\nWell how many people how many others got scratched but how do we\nRight okay so you did the age test and of course came up negative\nYes okay now what that's why I'm asking you\nKnow no matter of fact there is not good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the AIDS or ... yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there's I mean theoretically that she go to the doctor that you get stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an ... an emotional issue when you get scratched [laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always\nInteresting is there you know I have my knee and is there anything there in you know everybody default this is America where you default to how do I get money\nThat's it how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money oh sure that's a great case\nOh why not adding is high Agnes welcome to handle on the law well if I sure\nDo I get a pop problem I have a like a fake fest I that's what they can what less than half hour and they kept me seven hundred and Ninety nine dollars I Won that that I have to and then ride the ad family and ... from\nWhat I mean how much did you pay seven how do they\nKnow how much do you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nI Would say less than half hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they fix in half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you an estimate\nThey already did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed\nAnd when did they did they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nYou know there are no nothing already than just don't pay I\nGo then well then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal\nSays I Want a eight hundred dollars and so ah and then there's the issue\nOf uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's yeah that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right the work they did\nNot know what do you think you should pay I don't know I think Martin hadn't got it\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they are going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say it's too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I had nothing to do this and that and then the ...\nWhat do you mean you have now did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't my credit card\nOkay so you have the proof that you pay them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying it's too much and you and you want your money back and they overcharge you okay and you didn't know they overcharge\nYou until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was going to be eight hundred dollars she agreed they're going to lie about it at this\nAnd you're going to go to court and tell her to a judge okay that's that's all you can do\nThat I asked them for me if I go\nOf course you ... you have to ask them first okay that's the law you have\nMake a demand you went in writing say you over charge me I checked around\nAnd by the way you do have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I I think it's only we're two hundred dollars 'cause what kind of expertise you have ... nobody cares what you think it's I've checked around and you do want to check and it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharge me I Want my six hundred dollars back\nIn fact Tuesday is patch Tuesday [noise]\nLast Tuesday Microsoft said All right they had a big event to show off new hardware new surface pros and the surface laptops studios and so forth\nAnd at the event they said and today we're proud to say\nWe will begin pushing out the new feature update they call it Eighteen own mind 'cause in the September twenty Eighteen except it's October but it's close enough so that's it you know nine last one was Eighteen of three but it came out in may so eight five but I but anybody that don't pay no attention to the numbers that's not the most important thing the most important\nThing is is it you know these they do these a couple of times a year and windows to remember they said when does tend to last version of windows were not going to a ship\nA windows eleven we're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying whoa that feature up I stole divvied Europe they believe in all my documents one guy in the Microsoft\nSupport board said\n... gigabytes of documents and my documents folders gone well\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested as as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight nine has been tested for six months work their tests and the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's the windows insider program\nYou'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't they hadn't been really testing the installer\nSo maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly high on no anyway Microsoft's at ... and they have pulled back Eighteen online\nSo um\nYou won't be able to get a teen how nine if you were all excited about it probably few people have ... the way it generally works it was assumed that they Microsoft wasn't going to start kind of\nSaying you know you know how they do that with pop ups hey there's a new version windows one installed they until Tuesday he'll patch Tuesday so that people who got it where what Microsoft calls seekers\nI Am a seeker I'm a seeker of truth of wisdom end of windows updates and I got it because if you went to windows update and actively said what's that what's new anything now it would say well yeah there's this new feature update you want it\nI installed it on at least three\nComputers my Lenovo that I have in front of me the AT T for Seventy yes last year as a laptop I installed it on a surface go the new little mini surfaced that Microsoft put out a couple of months ago I saw it on my big surface studio the on one\nNo problems as far as I Know no documents to lead [noise]\nBut to some people didn't have that problem not unknown why hope you didn't and don't worry Microsoft is pausing they say that's the word they're not pulling it back then that withdrawing pausing pausing it nothing to fear here\n[noise] ah we had the iPhone announcement that's usually the big fall announcement right in August Samsung announced the note nine very nice phone there's another shoe to drop typically in October\nGoogle announced its new stuff and yes Tuesday Google as having an event in New York City hash tag made by Google there's really no\nI think there will be no surprises here we've been looking at the Google pixels three\nLeaks have been coming out for months\nI just wrote a review of it a review of it it hasn't even announced yet apparently Hong Kong or retailer had one and sold it to an end gadget reviewer and so he's reviewed it it's pretty clearly the\nYou know the real deal ... very nicely package solid and so forth [noise] ah that's nothing to see here it's nothing surprising we also I think get\nA new chrome or west powered they're going to call it\nAll the leaks say pixels light it will be a tablet you can add a keyboard to\nA pixel book to an update to chrome cast and perhaps something people are calling the home hub home ... everybody's got a home of now\nWe live in the ... world where um [noise] if you want to automate your home you get to choose do you want Sam something to do what you what apple to do what you want Google to do with you on Amazon to do it and you pick but then once you pick or you made a choice you know\nYou're you're you're in the family you're you're one of us\nSo we'll see what Google has to offer they don't really have a hub quite yet this is their chance I get the assistant right [noise]\nEighty eight eighty eight ethically out those are the big stories of the week there's more but really I Know you care more about what's going on in your life and so do I so

I Need to extend my wife fight\nSo that I can get a fire sticks or something like that for the other team east right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or if there's a better brand or main\n[noise] yeah this is a ... am I saying are the most optimal thing would\nBe the wire the whole house by horse but who's going to do that nobody let's go on the addict yeah yeah yeah of course yeah I\nI keep I'm tempted to do that in my house and the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go into their that's even worse me addict [laughter] lighter so or or or worse\nThe cable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended\nThat this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or\nYou know there's advantages for them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more challenges cetera et cetera et cetera [noise]\nUh but of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over your going over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or ... you know YouTube TV or whatever\nThey do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be Alan ...\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stop but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get and thought I signal you get the less speed you get it's a direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has eight to ... see are you\nHere ...\nMike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or micro bites how recently a decent\nWhy it's not the FSL um [noise] it's just that uh they also have the the the lock I'm mad as well we're very rural so the only choice we\nHad oh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend it most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife five router\nI did I did do that\nYeah okay good so you ... ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disabled that or at least turn off the wife by radio\nIf you could turn off the wife by radio that'll eliminate signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we called bridge boats they let the cable modem router 'cause it's still around her in there and decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why five routers\nUm erode sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from ... gear a veil up from is that links if I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things and these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the audience and then they have some units\nTypically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might might buy more and and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than\nSo you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system\nBut what will happen is the repeaters takes half the time talking to the route the base station and the other half the time talking to you so we\nAll wife I extenders cut wife I speed in half while\nAt the nature of a wife I extend or because they can't operate in what we call full duplex smoke they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the route or talk to you so that's split in half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference have a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slowed down so the ... and this is why it's the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife five foot print\nAnd plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume an arrow in my house there lots of companies all you have to look for mash\nUm the problem is the expense because you're not only buying a base unit you're going to buy one or two or three extra extenders in the end they usually start at three hundred dollars and uh they go up usually around a hundred hundred and fifty bucks per extender\nSo you haven't no but if they ... outlook probably really solve the problem and some of them are most of them have\nAdditional features for instance zeroes or\nHave if you pay extra I think it's a hundred bucks a year you're oh plus which has filtering so it keeps your kids off of ... it has things like you could say to your echo pause a juniors why fight in his will go off", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester",
