right\nWell that's what they have a a they have like what would be an outlet but for a\nYou know and it comes in and comes into the cable modem which turns the signal on the way\nBut what what do you mean that came a mother\nWho's your ... what kind of what kind of service do you have is it is it from a phone company from a cable company who's who's the Internet service provider\nThat's what I Need help with I don't know it's off\nThe icy I don't I see so they the office the people who own the building said and we're going to include why we're gonna include Internet\nCorrect I got it okay so so they're doing it OK okay\nAnd so you don't know who they are getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is

them\nDo you provide Internet access almost certainly they don't I mean it's possible why it's pretty typical though when you read office space that that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider that his wired ... the place up in in by Internet from them\nOkay ... okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my I'm a start up company do you think you'll be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum to a building twenty miles away like\nProbably not so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away is not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have we in our building for instance the studio I'm In right now\nWe have the local cable company wired up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local a fiber optic Internet service provider called sonic that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company you want to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say\nThis one is the one I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which one of my choices if it's spectrum you couldn't added to your existing spectrum service perhaps\n[noise] usually cable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections than homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know they're usually
