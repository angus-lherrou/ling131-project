{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "To the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I in my brain doesn't work but I'm working on probably three brain cells\n[laughter] losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen to my brain so a lot to make an excuse for it\nThough you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the ... six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough they\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or is it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it\nLike okay so on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down\nBut on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that though I don't mind that at all\nOkay so it's going to depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest ways of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone\nIs locked so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out\nYou know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones you precedent hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time and that'll put you in recovery mode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacturer and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what that what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it in there you know just kind of at the same time\nThe volume up button and you have to you said volume up in power at the same yeah and you can you hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing and holding the power off button\nSo power power at all the way down then press the power in volume button together and you'll see you should see and most of these phones they used a text based menu that the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume buttons up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset\nAnd a reset will just a race the phone take it back is if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nI did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife by that I hadn't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any tray\nPerfect perfect and then now\nSome people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow\nZero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down a ... the only issue would be somebody could get access to the notebook you're writing it right but as long as people aren't going\nTo get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm\nIn the like the targets and stuff they [laughter] this is I don't know if there's a good idea but I see no books that say passwords on the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no but but\nMaybe don't have one that says pastor but there's got to know book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer and any time you set a code of past or whatever\nJust write it down okay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep updating just the apps that came with it right\nAnd they only have eight ... I'm eight ... gigabytes of hard drives space and only one giggle memory and I'm always getting low memory an out of space\nMemory every time they do an update their updates or at least twenty to thirty gigabytes it's LED lights I'm Sorry yeah and that adds up over time when you're getting a little frequently yeah so\nBut you didn't want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a U ... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as yet they've done to delete it and they'll not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost time updates don't add to this amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay [noise]\nIt does leave in downloaded folder the ... or the update that you've downloaded and you can delete that okay\nYeah it will delete it by ... automatically\nOh oh okay yeah I Know windows they always do that oh that's\nRight windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands it in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it doesn't you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to thirty two gigabytes card\nOh well that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media\nAny data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see of a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing from you point the three fifty seven the other way fuel our show they brought you by car but\nIf the premier

you know the background kind of fades away and the end and the portrait pops out so each lands has different features different attributes a lot of photographic a teacher's suggest however\nAnd you know the temptation is going to be the get the kit lands which usually the twenty wide goes wide just kind of ... somewhat telephoto twenty four to seven to your ... something like that\n[noise] um [noise]\nThat is a nice all purpose lens a lot of teachers suggests starting with a single prime lands uh Fifteen millimeter latch which approximate the guy and really teaches composition because\nInstead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it and move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting that's going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad I don't want to have\nTo do all that I just want one lens and and and then you're then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kitten lands and then the question is well what do I need any other ... yeah yeah it does it all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive the the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening can get and it's it's it's it's an inverse so the lower the F stop the wider the aperture so\nWhen you see a lens that can do F. one point eight have two F. one point I even at one point for\nThose are lenses that have a wider can go wider opening and capture more light which means are great for not using flash for for getting a natural images they're great for torture they tend to be more expensive and you'll never see assume\nWe call it a fast lands but it can do that you never see assume that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast zoom maybe two point four three point five something like that and how do I think about\nInstead of getting the kid getting a body and then getting a nice say F. one point for fifty millimeter lands I think that would be a great teaching ones but you got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting an interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon and you're going to be going candidate icon lenses forever after you know because they have custom mounts each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard right now I'm a kind of a fan of the ... ah I was a cannon shooter for years and actually I currently shoot Sony's which are mirror lists\nUh but but for her first camera maybe an icon de thirty five hundred [noise] uh this is a good ... camera it's all you know starts at five hundred bucks\nA it is the sensors size is another thing that people often talk about and\nThis is an A. P. S. C. center which is a large censor but not full framed full framed gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to want but I think this the D. thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four Seventy a lens that goes with the kid\nA it is here's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at these deep he reviewed dot com

they go for like five seven processors they're like the machines you've got a brand new but there to to you know three four years old\nIn a way with Linux you want it that way because as machines get

don't\nCare if he can hit two bands with one ... one of the reasons I like five gee you know most modern wife I routers will do the older to point forgive her span and they will do the newer five ... it's been one of the reasons I like the five gee routers is it doesn't propagate\nAs far as the higher the frequency them more easily stopped by those doors trees\nAnd so what I like one theory of this is that you instead of trying to blast your way to why five success\nYou make little pools of wife by that are only visible to you and anybody in in close proximity and you have lots of little ones is is the plume philosophy plumes one of those ... uh use and I mentioned\nAnd by having many little plumes one in each room one in the hall you can create little pools of why find the ... don't get interfered with ...\nBecause the five hurt signals from your neighbors a hundred feet away aren't really propagating through your windows and doors and and nor you interfering with them and I think it's a much more neighborly way to get very good why five five years also can be very fast\nSo that's my my standard now for a for why if I if I if at all possible or I'll make sure I get five

low sir welcome a couple of quick questions um my wife has a an from selling which is almost two years old yeah and I have a s\nE which is so about a year and a half old and we're very happy with them she's a heavy user um charters are falling constantly when she's a at a particular time or whatever I let my phone go down to you know\nThe low solo before I charge it and um because I'm not necessarily a user of hers that I couldn't go two or three days with it anyway um I Know apple is offering a twenty nine dollar lottery replacement till the end of the year\nFor these photos um capacity is eighty six percent mine is eighty nine percent is it worth the money to replace those batteries\nYeah I mean you're you're in pretty good shape so when the phone comes is delivered to your door it's a hundred percent capacity that means\nIn generally are all of the mind batteries have a certain number of charge discharge cycles they can go through generally around five hundred [noise] so uh you know and a fraction of what your wife's doing a fractional charge discharge so she's letting it go down a quarter inch charging it up a quarter\nFor those make one are you are more you know discharging fully recharging so you're going to get that five hundred times\nAs it gets closer to that five hundred point it's going to get\nLower and lower the capacity at some point it's going to get so low that really won't hold a charge anymore and you will need a new battery apple had to do this they didn't want to do this they had to do it because they\nThey started pushing out software updates and we're slowing phones down with ... with their batteries were worn because they didn't want the phone to crash if there would be high demand on that battery and sometimes that does happen they say\nA lot of people said no it doesn't happen Android doesn't do it or it's a just a ploy to get you to buy a new phone and in response apple said well All right we'll let you get a new battery if you want I think you recommend I think you're probably All right I don't you know it's that's a pretty high level\nSo I should show or ... or so but not\nA good deal [laughter] but I you know boxes thirty bucks I don't think you need it\nIf it's a world don't fix it as you know\nThe old yeah and how much how many more years you want to use that as the\nAs long as I can I Love it I don't\nIt will it will get it back up to a hundred or so maybe we'll add you know six months to the life is is that worth thirty bucks that's the decision you have to make\nRight [noise] [noise] okay also can I comment on something you said last week\nIt's actually by the way Seventy nine dollars for the S. E. oh that'll change your point of view it as it is it depends on the phone while yes go ahead\nI'm you were talking about you know taking your cameras on vacation and\nAll these all the you know a photographer you like to carry a lot of stuff with you yeah and it occurred to me when I was listening because those are the show every week thank you\nUh I'm In the sixties one of the great photo journalist street photographers on record labels saw um\nOnly used one lambs at once ... regular went anywhere man with the amazing right yeah I mean\nHe used to like three fifty long either and sometimes use the thirty five\nAre actually bought a like M three because of that and and the fifty millimeter like a lens I'm almost all the great St Louis hog and France if you're a street photographer you carry one camera and one lens because you don't want to intimidate people and you don't have time to switch around [noise] so yeah of course and I think that's fine I think\nCreatively a kind of limits you exactly\nSo anybody that you should say that because of my last trip I bought one camera and if if the millimeter lands that was it well there you go [laughter]\nAnd I was told to do that by our photo guy Chris mark already said it's a great learning experience and it was in fact to add insult to injury I was a manual focus lens so the whole point

travel and we love the carpet option that we get one loop on ice on\nThem that awesome\nIt is I Love it and uh the challenge we've got is that we have to relatively recent cars that due to the car play auction [noise] so I've been playing around trying to figure out how to um use my iPhone\nTo build a link to a wife I I'd I'd all I'm traveling\nOh what a clever idea you want to basically I'll take the eye pad as your is your car player yeah\nYeah that way my wife and I can see where the maps gone and we can do agree\nSo much more pleasant experience and um but the problem I've got is that the maps on the eye pad even though I'm I'm connected by Bluetooth or something do not keep up with the travel um it's a life I I\nYou know why that is that I can say that yeah that I pet doesn't have GPS after GPS started to work like that [noise]\nSo you're so you're dreaming the map from the phone to the I had no\nIdea hooking up the I ... I was a hot spot to my\nOffice so using the ... yes so that's exactly why so um this is this is unfortunately and it's not an issue in the phone every iPhone has GPS built in\n... I parents do not unless you get one with a cellular ship in it the sale your ship is a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT\nAnd so that's the problem precisely is it the ... the I pat I'm fact I'm kind of impressed the I've had can kind of figure out where you are it's doing that by triangulating why fi access points and if you get out in the country where there's no why fight you won't know where you are\nA little slow sometimes you missed the terms before you\nReally yeah we're really in your phone is reliable 'cause it's using GPS ... pet is not okay\nIt does it does do location is actually clever\nTrick that ah ah apple uses Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove a lot of cars around with GPS is instead I noticed when I was Fifteen feet from ... pointe a twelve feet from access point B and a hundred feet from Akron points see I'm here\nIn a mate literally made a map\nTriangulating all the Y in almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google Now do that themselves with their own cars but uh that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect\nObviously interesting self I bought an eye pad that has the GPS ... he wouldn't\nBe a lot of your trick is your next die pat and good news apples probably coming out with I had this month for 'em get one within ... chip then you don't have to be I mean you're still going to have to pay for an out to eat connection that's a pain for a but you'll have that way you won't have to pay for it to the phone for the data and you'll have GPS will be accurate [noise]\nSounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something oh I'm ... years it was\nYeah too bad it's just the way it is not a problem and the reason is Israel is right ... thanks for the call is very simple\nThe to chip that apple puts in\nProbably ... was from Qualcomm nowadays I guess it's from into a is a dual purpose chip does GPS and Internet\nOr and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're going to they're going to release I'm almost certain\nThere's lots of evidence that they're going to release new I ... this year probably knew I had pros or remember that Apple's latest phones all the phones this year have a new interface they don't have a home button they don't have a fingerprint reader they face i._d.\nAnd they have new ways of swiping and swooping in looping to control the thing because you don't have a home buttons you swipe off to go home and all that\nAh apple is going to inevitably move everything to the end of the first I think the first step there will be these new I passed it they'll release now we have an event no one knows\nThere's no consensus on this or they are also expected to release new Mac a platforms probably not the new ... crow but I Know you know we're looking for frankly a\nMac book air in a ... book replacement of some kind and uh that would also probably come out new air pots\nThat's that's there's some evidence that they're they're going to upgrade the air pods yeah a partly because they've been deeply discounted by a lotta merchants about apple but others that usually means rather clearing them out for the new ones\nSo it's enough new stuff they could have an event but I in my gut is there not", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "08"}
