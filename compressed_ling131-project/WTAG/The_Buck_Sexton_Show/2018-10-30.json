hold on let\nEvil lurks in the hearts of men that [laughter] and it does and what Trump has tapped into is evil or and eventually will overcome that because of the Republicans are always about the past\nAnd they're always have that fear of the future and the Democrats are made plenty of mistakes that they are about the future and idealism and making America a better place I think in the end hope wins over evil but it takes a long time and it works but\nIs it is this a star wars trilogy hope when the dog side hope when's over evil\nWhen it gets better both of those working humankind and that's what this struggle about from that this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nDid you hear that I'll just do one more time to make sure you got to about\nGood versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nThat'll bring us together right because half of the people in this country voted for him and support him so that'll bring us together right\nTrump is tearing us apart or Adam Schiff democratic congressmen said this over the weekend\nHonestly I think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us uh he gets up in the morning with a new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year you saying things to bring us a into conflict with each other\nThe wait a minute wait a minute women women so Donald Trump\nThe man the president to finally make good on the promise to recognize Jerusalem as the capital

what the problem is down and he went on to talk about it it's on our college getting the real anti Semitism in America is is not\nAnd the Klan it's not what the white nationalist it's on college campuses to divest movement a boycott movement from from Israel\nOr he told the story about a student he knew who was going to do a semester abroad in Israel and needed a recommendation from a

want the destruction of Israel because they want the destruction of the Jews how many times do I have to say this\nHow many ... and now or what do you hear this one this is a good one [noise]\nHeadlines out there the Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh said Trump is not welcome to visit the synagogue were eleven people were shot I said my God really I mean they don't want to visit from the president well you got to read deep into the story\nAnd you find out that it's the Pittsburgh chapter of a progressive and radical left wing Jewish group called the bend the arc\nThe arc arc as an arc of the covenant is a very left to I mean they're left of Bernie radical left Jewish group well they're Pittsburgh chapter and I I guess\nThere's twelve people in their Pittsburgh chapter wrote a letter to the president saying we don't want you here oh well wait a minute you've got to denounce white nationalism\nSo wait a minute are these actually the people who represent the Jewish community in Pittsburgh or is this just a radical group and their local chapter\nAnd why would you say you don't want the president there then you get the mayor of Pittsburgh seeing guns are not the solution to solving this problem wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute hold on hold on if I'm going into a synagogue\nThis weekend and I've been in many synagogues\nI I'm I'm going to look around for security what's the security here\nAnd and if you don't have security why don't you\nYou know you're a target did you know the homeland security was in this Pittsburgh synagogue within the past year training them an active shooter situations\nI mean that's how bad it is in this country that homeland security has to go to synagogues and teach them about active she I mean I Know we have to do it in our schools\nBut here's the thing if you know people are coming in with guns and frankly I was surprised and this isn't victims shaming I was actually surprised that this Pittsburgh synagogue didn't have\nGo to New York city on a Saturday morning and walk by synagogues and see what you see what the security is we're talking people in swat uniforms and we'll swap weapons\nAnd and it's unfortunately it's necessary and a good friend of mine who was a who is Jewish show wrote to me earlier this morning and said yeah I I I I don't understand what\nThis is all about um\nLondon synagogue armed guards public schools in Israel armed guards or by the way no shootings at London synagogues or Israeli schools Alan Dershowitz went on to say I have to go\nThrough a metal detector to go to temple\nAnd they're armed guards there yeah unfortunately it has to be that way so the mayor of Pittsburgh what are you talking about or that synagogue this weekend that have armed guards ready to stop anyone their Second Amendment Jewish groups\nWho are slamming the media\nFor saying that well you don't need guns they're\nRabbis who carry guns rightfully so\nWhat did Hitler due to the Jews took away their guns first go to the go to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC\nAnd look at the relics they have their of guns of those who had guns in the Warsaw Ghetto ... and we're trying to fight\nBack against the Nazis\nOf course you would have guns and again we're not\nBlaming the Pittsburgh synagogue but many other synagogues they're they're they're protected and should be\nBecause

saying maybe an armed guard would have been able to save lives in that horrible shooting at the synagogue in\nPittsburgh we got somebody who's got strong opinions on the matter of having somebody who is armed and trained on premises as a general matter a Jesse Kelly is with us now he is of course the host\nOf the Jesse Kelly show he is a fan favorite here in the freedom that you can ... on our

I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the leftist to resist out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nYes for justice\nThis first step forward and that's because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place the target of or potential target\nAs an armed guard side of it or close by that cold security that's the norm that's the real world but even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place that generally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting a sterile it depends where you are I I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever arms uh and I I don't know or or another congregants I shouldn't say remember arm\nUm but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are\nBut the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological lot of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd you know that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement\nThe last off it ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic to you both because you are CIA and do you have comments that you do you acknowledge the way the world really is\nBut I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of anytime dar for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one ever been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nAnd do I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also were a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there\nBut you know you you look at at the the cultural differences\nIn the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp as an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts\nI mean they think this is crazy sounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarities with guns all that's a big part of it\nThey've also been raised to think or they'd they'd been led to believe by their peers in those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad thing really I mean that's really the belief and also by the way Jessie the people who are part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and at worst a threat\nYeah my kids are not they've both shot fires before real gun not just Bebe gun shot guns they're familiar with them they have had gun safety drilled into their heads\nBecause she comes from a damaged political brand out but you can't help herself\nHillary Clinton as I have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there was nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views herself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive causes politically speaking\nYou know she stood beside bill she allowed so many people to uh bash are all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her\nIn her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice is done is if she becomes president United States and I\nI've been saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record year\nWhat happens is that the Democrats if they take their house marchers right into fights over impeachment that\nThe whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months\nAnd then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but the only way to set it right would be to make Hillary president finally to break\nThat LA and finally\nPut her in a position where she gets to be the president of the United states I'm I'm not the only one who's thinking this Hillary yourself you could tell it's like well I mean I'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that\nI really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified than I Am I mean this is this is a kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed to walk\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it that's where we are with us she she has not given up\nOne bit she still thinks that this is the way that it's all going to go and and what of what a a a a crazy story and her mind it's got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you could tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do in her\n... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess\nThat that Trump created and oh by the way you own this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much so in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next year's or this coming Tuesday may now yeah next Tuesday that's next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin\nA next Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats I think by the way you're going to have a huge field of candidates on the Democratic side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters\nNot totally convinced that ... he still thinks that are doesn't still think that he's going to Ron I'm I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really be to anybody who's living in the real world\nI Would not be surprised if you did in fact\nHave an ... candidacy I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the others out there Elizabeth Warren probably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump\nAll that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how\nHumiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupt\n... Clinton's that was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years\nAnd the next election is going to be socialism\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a Seventy percent tax\nRate kind of redistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs a massive government intervention the healthcare markets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals\nA ... that's going to be with the next elections all about\nA and what's with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know they they've gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred\nAnd I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about it because he's such a weirdo and is Joe in significant\nIn terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only influence you have to get us into wars that were or at least in one case\nVery bad idea [noise] um but you know he'll just slander Trump with stuff like the ten\nFox News on that crowd Breitbart and enforcing the Daily Caller Republican congressman there have been vilified George Soros for years and basically because George Soros is a rich through and so when they talk about Soros start talking about\nA rich Jew who's in control of everything or when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump's other Kobus rightwing extremist here germs this is those repugnant dog whistling which has gone assaults and you're right it's not just ... a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks that Fox News they really everything that he's saying is a vision narrow\nSmear by the way everything people don't refer to anti Semitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor that's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global list it's some kind of dog was global is is a term that's been used in international relations\nAre for decades and has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter\nA global is I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at him referred you historically that were for Jews and as globalism nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism um\nBooth realizes that if you're going to go to the other team but not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despised Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from a left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends and allies\nI don't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with a known now and and ideologically in line with\nAnd later to turn around because it was convenient for me and call\nThem all [noise] what a creature this ...

V. and that's a very crowded space right now is you know that's not an easy thing to be number one it\nAnd the drama they bring to the table I mean they did a nice I mean imagine if you look so miserable they've noticed that when they're on air how miserable are not happy they look yeah well you know generally like to go through life bucking sorry\nGenerally being double home Rutgers is a bad start to things\nI'm just putting a a very good just putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know that's not good that's not a good thing that I'm not a\nWhat's the word bad karma yes bad karma of speaking of um I have no good transition here but you know see because I was like wait NBC CBS they're both networks other than that\nAnd they're both full lives but CBS ... had this uh this segment about hate speech and taking down hate speech and this has been one of the issues that as you know I've been talking about for a long time here\nWhere we you know you have this chorus particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line um and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservative stature shock\nNo one out but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite soft line that can't get ISIS and these other groups\nAre to be taken out of their\nTheir the cyberspace but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts the activated but here's part of this a discussion and I have a slightly different view of this in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be ...\nYou can be radical online radicalized online has already been supported by our government that we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to\nISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize the F ... isolated individual as we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated in different contexts in a particular case of powers yeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle\nIt's very difficult to identify what ... what is not hate speech and to set from Paul is on that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be a situation where\nConservatives are the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're in force against the left at all and ... and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that\nLouis Farrakhan still has lots of social media are still is able to view his hatred intolerance\nThis is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's effort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all\nAnd you know here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets to pose in photos with rock Obama when he's running for the presidency remember that oh that's right journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there\nAre but Farrah Khan is still treated as somebody by the media who should have and does have a voice he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlets but here's the kind of stuff that minister Farrakhan says play fourteen and one\nWhere you recognize the\nOne where you see the panic zoo\nAnd the synagogue of Satan which had many races in it [noise]\nBecause they need to see the whole world\nThink about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd come clean\nWhenever you read it\nHas told the Jews to hear an old ... and they say I hear and I did they\nThe disobeying God\n\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the St panic Jew Farrah Khan says\nAnd he's still somebody that prominent Democrats\nCan hang out with an public Ken Ken speak with whether it's commentators were politicians\nUh you'll notice that you don't have Democrat presidential contenders asked the way that the way the Republicans were asked about David Duke loser that nobody cares about nobody gives a you know what to hear from\nAll Republicans have to be asked in every presidential cycle will do ... do you just about David ... why is it every Democrat after you disavow do you disavow Louis Farrakhan\nWhy wasn't Brock Obama asked you you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Hillary Clinton asked do you disavow\nCirca\nOh that's right you mean the media is dishonest and their activists and there are so sensitive about an hour because we now all are figuring out the\nTruth yeah that's right that's what I thought you know it's not smart\nJust sort of post and stuff on the Web and you've got a job opening and hoping that someone who is great sees it you know it's not smart spending a ton of time trying to track down all the different places on line you posted because you don't even remember 'cause you don't know what the best one was you know what is\nGoing to zip recruiter dot com slash book to hire the right person ...\nDoesn't depend

were diverted think about this you're you're flying from you know Chicago to a Miami let's say\nAnd all of this would be a pretty bad route you know ... you know you had bad weather on the way to Miami so they divert your flight to New York\nAnd now you're there and you have a hand gun that you checked legally which in Chicago it'd be hard enough as it is but let's just assume you checked it legally with the airline you unchecked because now you got to get another flight the next day when you go back to check in with your next flight they've arrested people for that\nFor not having a premise permit for New York city and having a firearm in in New York\nThey've arrested and they know that that's why that's why they had to go so I'm just saying that they they look to penalize people I mean there is a an aggressive attitude about gun owners that some law enforcement agencies and I think ATF has very high on that list\nThat some law enforcement agencies or adopt in a way that is I think it puts them attention with the constitution and and it's really problematic but even with the hog and these others about the ... it just gets so boring after a while\nThey they know that they're not really going to get this ban on fires\nThe guy spoke today from ATF I remember his name doesn't really matter he wants his delusions the gun problem is to have all semi automatic rifles all semi automatic rifles cause as you said\nA rifle that can kill a deer can kill human so that's what he said all semi automatic rifles need to be licensed at the same level that a fully automatic rifle is right now that's his new solutions so you might be hearing that\nMore and more and I said oh do you really think that I could get a fully I I live in DC do you think that I could even get a fully automatic weapon here no matter what I tried to do no matter what my background is and he didn't know the answer\nI said the answer's no dude\nI was just kind of shocked has got to work the eight year for twenty five years and seems like he doesn't know the gun laws that well which was surprising except for the fact that he's obviously an anti gun sell it\nBut that's the truth\nAnd you know this is what you're going to see people who\nAre not particularly well versed in and what's real and what's not with these issues to orange a very strong on the second amendment will pretend to
