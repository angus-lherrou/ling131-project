{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "These you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least\nAnd for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up realizing that you don't really want to eat candy all the time you know you you don't really want to be in a position where you're just\nConstantly ... on racist pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces you will find yourself\nAt some point to have eaten all the ... you know ... the most uh most popular candy in the world that's right I mean that's number one\nIt was a random aside I almost\nA started working when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a I forget which I don't remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy I'm pretty sure it was the Mars account which is a ... so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you read all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reaches level where you're like I've I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore and uh\nSo you learn that as a kid and that but that as an adult as a guy you\nKnow you you get to be a rather than women tend to dress some women somewhere that a lot of your like buck I dress like a\nUm I dress like a witch and not a naughty which put a scary one or whatever that's that's cool but some college age and and ... and older young women tend to dress in\nMore provocative fashions events August worried about this it also is a reminder for me to cultural appropriation which has gotten all this attention right now or the or the holiday season cultural appropriation is not a thing\nOr it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to any one or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are John ... a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution and the only way that culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only\nBe part of the general cultural odds most is like that pulled out of fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged it as well but now I also remember some of my\nMy best and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume that you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nThey'll be showing don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAs an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I oh I see how it is\nI see your call me out and see what's up there is producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse right now are sea within earshot of the microphone I think he's talking to a naughty secretary over somewhere that that sounds that sounds about right or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike is he's out getting phone numbers\nUm but I and I could tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC\nI found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party\nAnd I I uh theater supply store and they let me rents because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money got rent it\nAnd I rented a full on theatrical production costume slash kind of uniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... to ... and a pipe\nAnd the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way tend to lose be surprised how much attention to the ladies gave to a guy walks around wearing\nWearing the pen to lose so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year or with the kind of a you know the seventies style tennis\nOut fix I just basically shrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band then enter wouldn't tennis racket so that worked out\nSo I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who is is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend appropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it\nThis is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpikes a candy corn pumpkin juice do ... candy corn roster cheat as your ... you know this site and somebody might finally appears some ask somebody what ... what is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember\nI was never a huge Halloween guy I mean I can I add the loved it but I thought I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friends did a group thing and we did the ah\nAddams family and uh I was ... Adams I'm\nAnd that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individually people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got altogether it was like you guys are awesome\nSo that was a sort of on a\nNice ... Halloween parties\nThat ... I Know I'm more right\nA fair enough you know\nAnd I will eat the candy and I will give out the candy but uh what is the best Halloween candy good question\nI mean I I'm a I have a huge sweet to so I don't ... I couldn't\nResist visas for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think Greece's pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular\nConsidered I'm a ... we actually got into this conversation ... I'd like to freeze some of my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion\nYeah I I had not thought about that I Do know that are on chip for all those listening\nIf you ever like make brownies you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer and then you want to put them in the microwave the you'd do maintain freshness baked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah I didn't learn until like a couple of years ago and apparently they didn't they didn't teach us that CIA school\n[laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer Mike the giants were going to come back we got a buddy Benny Johnston in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHamel kind of like a double dose of the Daily Caller this product on the show\nAnd you know before I actually did a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the podcast today with Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that I oh by the way I Will be on a brief show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth about wild stuff [noise]\nAnd uh I'll be back in just ... [noise]\nThe FBI calls home titles that's one of the fastest growing crimes my French British yourselves if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for when the Steelers your homes title everything's online these days including your homes titled domestic and international thieves\nHunt American homeowners because we have equity in our homes and the bad guys are stealing it they take you off your homes title an add an alias than they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice\nIdentity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome title walk safeguards your homes title from cyber thieves and hackers by putting it on line perimeter around your homes title\nAnd he was political views and make comments about transgender Z and things like that um he went bankrupt with this company and screw the state of Rhode Island probably part of the reason why ... got the paw socks 'cause Rhode Island was reluctant to give money to a private entity again\nBut he the guy had the bloody sock\nYou can't take any of that away from him you know it's one thing they say well you can't have Pete Rose there he ... he ... he was placing bets on the sport okay Curt Schilling hasn't really hasn't done anything to\nHurt the integrity of baseball and he was an integral part of the two thousand four World Series championship after eighty six dry years for the red Sox\nI say a Curt Schilling sympathizer I Am not yeah me uh but uh he kind of put it best when he said never once as one of his teammates come out and called him a racist or homophobic and you've never had an issue with his teammates yeah he may have his police that he kind of kept\nTo himself during his playing days yeah since then he's kind of come out and let people know how he feels yeah he definitely should have been there\nYeah he gets screwed by John Henry and the politically correct Red Sox which now on the bottom you know he owns the Boston Globe I mean this is all what virtue signaling huh Steve what's your thought on this well I mean I'll\nTake sort of Curt Schilling out of it for the moment this is an organization who literally\nLove is these pregame ceremony is loves then this is like there they like the pregame ceremony more than the actual game have things like organized down to a tea and then they come to this one they're like oh yeah well we were just winging it\nYou know I we told anybody who wants to come from the fourteen they can come wait wait what your first world series in eighty six years yeah celebrating that team and then you're just sort of like we see anybody can come if they want to yeah bowl I don't believe that what a bunch of water bunch\nYeah what about the ... yeah the guards Churchill and got the sort of scrutiny is he really did not a sympathizer either for that guy at all no but I Know that like I said yeah I I'm I'm not either oh of course for me to be fired by ESPN is kind of a badge of courage\nUh as far as I'm concerned but you know the the folks from the red Sox talk about talk about backpedaling I mean man it's like they're going there they're going backwards for a pop up fly into into the center field wall that's uh that's how much they're back pedaling\nThe ... originally they said oh we just invited to players\nAnd then you know other people called and said hey that like can be part of it than you know I never got around to Curt Schilling\nCome on\nYou know what you know what it really does it really bothers me because the red Sox around the cost of a of a World Series championship right now\nAnd to just pull this crap you know changed the name of Iraqi way by the globe make it even more or less the radical ... and and this kind of stuff\nAnd it just it really it's like you know what ... trying to make me not like you\nAre you really trying to make me not like you I understand\nProtecting your product and and the Boston Red Sox are a product just like the show is\nBut come on\n... what did they think we're going to happen people are gonna boo Curt Schilling is that is that what they were worried about save that would be working in a blue courage yelling or we don't we didn't want to be associated with his ...\nWe have we don't want to we are right we we don't really agree with what he stands for and so that's why we're we're not which is again putting yourself ahead of\nLove and suppliers everybody involved and the thing it's it's all about the red Sox you know that they put their own personal politics and priorities ahead of everything else that's going on which is annoying to because yeah it's very annoying\nI mean look at the place the guy deserves in history of course you know as Johnny Damon would say what was in the middle for we're just a bunch of what was it idiots idiot idiot yeah we're just a bunch of idiots but Curt Schilling went out there and yeah the bloody sock and even though what did he sell it after that or something you know I Can't remember\nBut he went out there and he had a bloody sock that was a real\nThat was up a a a such a a representation if you want to know what that year was like for the Sox like a bloody sock and he still pitch and what was it what did they done staple some tendon back together and his ankle\nYeah they had some suitors and staples down and then he thought that goes to the game it didn't hold\nAnd they ripped and he's playing any still you know he still throwing rockets over the plate come on [noise]\nKnow it's interesting to look at it like you know everybody gets the NFL such a hard time for putting the politics ... into it and I\nI think this might be a little bit different in terms of this has nothing to do with the players\nIf you're thinking to yourself I don't want to watch the red Sox anymore 'cause their owner is you know X Y and Z that's fine but\nI Will say that I don't think this has anything to do with a ... and David Price and Chris Sale and all the other you know on a team that have gotten them to this point you know so it is to me important to separate the two and you know you can still tell John Henry I feel about him but still be able to watch the game and oh no\nNo no no no right right I'm not I'm not turning away from the game this is not this is about actually the owners and hey don't get me wrong I I'm Upset with the ... NFL not saying hey guess what guys stand up you know ... and ... and then do a little too little too late over the summer\nThey put the new rule in but no this is what John Henry like this is the kind of anger that people had with um\n[noise] uh you know the Yankees organization under George Steinbrenner [noise] no but no kidding aside no but I mean really like they love their Yankees but they would be mad at Steinbrenner for the things he would do right\nHow come you have like you to Cal zone right in his office no how 'bout how come you traded your view [laughter] get\nTogether and I'm like you don't want that how you doing [laughter] [noise]\nThat's a Seinfeld folks but no but that kind of stopped for a member when George\nWas being interviewed for the job of the Yankees any insulted Steinbrenner how he said you have taken our our beloved Yankees and made them into a laughing stock you know offer the glorification of your massive EEO\n[noise] yeah you know there were a threat of course we have her you know who you know but\nWhen when the election or a ... vote for her I'm going to have your enemy nuclear war or were you know Russia you got to be or were\nUh Iran or North Korea not to have her who wore home got everybody making 'em for here at\nHome right right and it's it's we know it's not true we know it's not a ... that's not what's happening I'm really it takes away\nThe responsibility for the twisted individual\nWho is responsible it it's just like the the guy who shot Steve ... I mean it was a Bernie supporter I don't think that anything to do with it but you didn't hear Republicans say that maybe they should you know sometimes they say you\nYou you got to fight fire with fire and that's the way the Dems fight I don't know I don't know speaking of fighting fire with fire just got a great media advisory from community action people helping people about Jim McGovern\nJim McGovern touts important some headstart\nSix hundred thousand dollars in federal funds and twenty thousand from Berkshire Bank newly committed for a double you see a sea Webster project\nCongressman James McGovern toured worst or community action councils headstart renovation project located in one sixteen school street in Webster today and announced his success and securing six hundred thousand dollars for the federal administration of children and families to support the project\nListening to uh the quote from him\nThis is a big deal head start is one of the best programs we have for breaking the cycle of poverty that prevents far too many students from living up to their God given potential\nFor every dollar we invest in head start our country realizes nine dollars in benefits through increased earnings and decreased reliance on safety net programs this grant together with a half a million dollars we secured and two twenty seven team\nIs a huge investment and the children and families in Worcester county I'm proud of my advocacy to secure this vital funding and thankful to our team of local state federal and nonprofit partners who brought this vision to life OK let's just quickly go through what's wrong completely wrong with everything he said there\n'cause I'll use his own logic to against them okay for every dollar we invest in head start our country realizes nine dollars in benefits through increased earnings and decrease reliance on safety net programs well if that's true\nAnd we can get a nine hundred percent return on our investment\nCan we put a trillion dollars into head start\nI mean if I came to you and said I've got an investment here and you ... you're going to get you're going to make nine hundred percent on your money when you'd be a fool not to invest or well wait a minute [laughter]\nWho would be the fool because when you say a gym that doesn't make any sense how am I going to make nine hundred percent on this\nHe's saying just like man this is the common refrain Nancy Pelosi said remember when she talked about food stamps and welfare\nHow much economic for every dollar spent on food stamps I don't know what the government gets like three to four or five dollars back\nReally that doesn't make any sense how can you hear something like that and then say oh that's great that's like in Nineteen eighty four of the the the story Nineteen eighty four by George Orwell tell people that and tell them that it's great and you just don't use any logic to think about it one other thing is is\nThat the typical McGovern typical Richie Neal um he says head start\nIs one of the best programs we have for breaking the cycle of poverty\nNo it isn't\nNo no see it is not you know what to head start is\nHead start is this\nYou created the welfare state with the great society with Johnson\nAnd so you made families less and less responsible for their own children you even send devised\nFathers to be absentee gonna break up the family\nAnd now this is your fix for it right [noise]\nAnd let's talk about breaking the cycle of poverty Jim McGovern you opposed\nThe program at the worst or housing authority developed by re Mariano a fellow Democrat someone who grew up in public housing you opposed his program that was voluntary that help to get people out of public housing\nThat\nAs long as they went to work and their kids went to school they could stay in public housing and money would be saved for them but if they didn't do that they were out new said I Can't participate in the program that tosses people out of public housing well then watch the incentive to leave public housing\nSo don't put out a press release with your friends from the community action council and talking about how this is a this is going to break the cycle of poverty where all that this does this contributes to what perpetuates the cycle of poverty [noise]\nYou're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space from the double

G. W. H. one sixty nine million dollars a year\nI'm a I'm going to start making some uh I'm going to start making some jokes about people were in blackface right know hey joining us the good old trend Massachusetts zone national correspondent Michael by our good morning my go\nGo off you\nAre good I haven't lost it even though you're in the big times now like a like Megan Kelly making the big money having lost Massachusetts roots I'm not at all my my idol that well if\nYou remember and just not too long ago she was going to be the future face of NBC\nBe the person they were going through on this yeah she had this whole new vibe that she was going to be taking on his persona she wanted to do all these different kinds of projects and now today according to a person with direct knowledge on the matter Meghan Kelly and this is a quote is never coming back\nQuote she's now I'm going to say this um ... you know knew what she said this kind of like Meghan did you really think that through like wearing black faces okay however\nI learned a long time ago from someone that if you if you know a person wants to be chew don't hand them the stick NBC wanted out with her yesterday two days after she started they want out like they they said this is a a bad deal for us she just handed them the stick\nIt and that and that's another part of this too because of what we're hearing is that for weeks\nPrior to this like literally the last three weeks up to this black face incident deal there were discussions going on about how she and NBC wanted to end or run with the show part of her show and how they were going to move to a more newsy portion of NBC on some level you know I mean it brought her in\nAs a very talented individual he wanted to see her as the face of NBC News they gave for that show that was up against sixty minutes and nobody goes up and wins against sixty after the NFL it\nDone that unless you then I felt good point\nYeah and so with that that automatically people oh well we can't figure out what to do with are there so let's move her over here to an audience in the morning at nine AM\nOh that is filled with women that have never watched on Fox News is acceptable and overwhelmingly powerfully successful she was on Fox new tire really different audiences that no exposure to her\nNine AM in the morning on the today show so they haven't really found comfort spot for them with her to get to a place where she could be successful the ratings had been lackluster at best you know they were having these discussions to move around and then this comes up and it just kind of forces everybody\nTenure now hearing from other executive that network that she's too toxic to handle because this now throws out there's five of\nWell she had racist statements at Fox and now this we're not sure we can handle her right now\nYeah we're talking with Michael by our our national correspondent Michael the thing that gets me though is the hypocrisy and NBC you know there are other people when I went through this with Danny earlier I mean Jimmy Fallon performed in blackface ... did I did a comedy bit in blackface um let's see who else are like\nThat I bring up on that I think of is is a major thing version of that if you saw Tropic Thunder the Albert Downey junior an African American character full on pay the whole thing you\nKnow the whole areas and that and he never received any flack for those\nNames I Know and a a a Jimmy Kimble used to ... who did he use called Malone Carl Malone he used to do and mock Carl Malone ... you know look like you stupid he was in blackface\nOr his old girlfriend us our Silverman she did a thing not too long ago in blackface actual the blackface not not like make me look like an African American life like Kimball did and uh know\nBlackface like algae Olson war the black like a shoe polish with the white around the lips you know ...\nI think we're at a place now and maybe I'm wrong in this but I feel like in the way they were handling society now it's all about getting something taking out of context and putting it on social media to cause outraged really with the five second we quickly can get literally discussion when she was having with other others on the panel discussion\nAbout what isn't isn't okay for Halloween costumes and what the cost and police are pulling people take that off put on socially it looks like she's saying something totally different\nAnd it is true and and I'm not a big Megan Kelly fan and I agree with you\nThat was not the place to put her it would be like putting me on Access Hollywood tomorrow I Can't I Can't do it it's not my it's not my forte now before we go let me ask you this question how much of the sixty nine million do you think she walks out of there with [noise]\nI think there's going to be a good portion of it that she's going to walk away and I wouldn't be honestly surprised she leaves with a full sixty nine million she gets fifty million of it or anything less than that I Would think that they just aren't making a good deal that they know something else going on but I'd say someplace between fifty and sixty nine she'll be walking away with which\nCould bite or a little bit of time at home with the kids and kind of figure out what her next move is going to be well everything else dies down\nYeah absolutely and Sunday she gonna end up

Florida Man could spend decades in prison authorities say he's the one responsible he raised a package bombs tent around the country man with\nOr not the best ... we're not in the end\nOf the\nMajor cheerleader ... uh you have people at CNN or making sure that ah his name is trying to move down and the DNC a presidential candidate with a he is a criminal as I said maybe it's time for us to rethink like an eye as being the frontrunner\n\nNow I I also going to have you been ... Halloween Halloween is a holiday that some of us think of as\nUm you know for kids where do you come down on this issue\nOr it's not only for kids\nIs it a holiday for kids or should adults dress up I'm going to getting into a whole sexy costume conversation coming up here a few minutes and I don't even know where you come down on this issue should adults we dressing up for Halloween\n[laughter] uh I mean Jeff I there's been a major issues in the new flight problematic costumes I think Megan Kelly had a call this week about a essentially defending\nIt must be defending classmates I don't want to do but she just doesn't have a job anymore she has ... million dollars or a bank account so that's great you're fired me my guess would be fired by NBC and to get Seventy million dollars or so um but yeah\nI I don't remember the problem I get to dress up as Brett Kavanaugh her all the way you know I'm going to wear a I've got your outfit and I'm Out of gas or and I'm not a sign around my neck and says I like your\nAnd and that's going to be like I I don't I don't really understand why or what would be you know what would be problematic for this ah advocate or an adult\nNow on them and Kelly thing ... did you should do or show back in the day at Fox I feel like you probably\nWere in the mix for that I'm the first person that ever ... ever put me on prime time at\nFox oh I said yesterday that I feel like I have some\nYou know as I have a certain fondness for American but then again I think she made ... incredibly bad decisions when it comes to leave it how she let Fox wins you a box where she went from Fox but to me it could be any more obvious they just wanted to get rid of her I mean this was really the ... what you said really wasn't like viral offense\nWell no offense I mean this is sort of what happens in media is I think that NBC looking for an excuse to\nGet rid of backing Kelly rabies are taking a she wasn't getting into the network and I think they are the number one opportunity I say there was a major major conflict\n... ... is is that the network but kept Matt Lauer around for decades and they're saying that work I wouldn't want Ronan Farrow to argue one scene on our website so it's a huge double standard\nYeah and and I got to say this is where we'll also see the one of one of my maxim says that the less takes care of its own where you can get\nTerminated or on the left unless you were actually unknown predator or something really terrible you know you're actually doing something that border line up to and including they'd be criminal or you can have a second acting you've already seen who's the guy who ah the comedian Louis de caves coming back these other people\nI think men Kelly done I I don't think that you know ... maybe she'll be a you know selling slow cooker is only the home shopping network or something but I don't think any major networks are going to give her another shock because there's only one place where to go and she left\nThe Megan Kelly in a like infomercial for a U.S to read steak cookers would be amazing yes ah yeah that would that'd be that'd be absolutely but you're exactly right I mean we've got to figure out I\nI have no idea I I I just ... on fire all her credentials with conservatives and the concern was really loved her over opted not all around and be state\nThen the people that we see the left at NBC they didn't like her and the first place so they ... both sides on fire so where does she go from here\nAnd she's not going back to Fox ah and I you know and I don't think anyone else is going to see the investment studying million dollars a really being a meaningful or worthwhile investment because she didn't never delivered on reading\nAnd and and what universe issue or Seventy million dollars by the way I mean the idea we had\nI don't know that we're ... interview remember that that was the big break out she went and interviewed ... ... and\nIt doesn't even speak English how much of an interview that really be let's get serious ... second she can't even communicate with him\n[noise] everyone criticized driving up and down for what you are for firing her the fix and feel her everything uh it just didn't work out the whole time Kelly that'd be the was an eye on mitigated disaster I think leading Fox was a huge huge issue and people that are conservative\nMedia you just got to know that there are a long night for you wherever you go\nYup it is true ...
