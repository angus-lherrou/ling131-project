Thursday puppy son he was in the mid seventies you can get your forecast anytime a W ... dot com key word whether\nTaking aim at the accuser\n... news President Trump better valley in Mississippi mocking the testimony of Christine ... toward the moon accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a sexual assault when they were in high school\nThat's what he would say it would of course be a cave it would be a concession it would be Kavanaugh taking a rather flake taking a position on cabin all that's all about self interest and we'll talk more about this so I Do worry that\nAfter all said and done and any reasonable person would look at this extension and the additional facts that have come out in the new ... I Know they're talking to mark judge now the FBI is going to go interview mark judge marketed and tell them exactly what he's already written down into sworn statement\nI don't know this woman I don't know what she's talking about just didn't happen cabinet never did this she's like basically that's what you can say about Ford remember you afford Ramirez\nSweat Nick ... is the one who says that maybe maybe he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask them what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of events is it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some room mate or doesn't like look you could find people in college didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they'd probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever the trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college there's they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you're a conservative everybody\nLoves to bash on conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think ... realizes that she's done in the Senate if she boats now she's done that's my impression that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more\nTransactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concern and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch reflect you see they can't get Kevin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person in the cabinet was above gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence for any of this because there is no weapons\n\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there's the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight he lived out in the late ... and ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations and for its really are about how he behaves is drunk\nSo that is very relevant and trail\nOf himself as actively choir boy or is there much contradicted by his ... for example in college as long as people in and and I still why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from one for like ... ...\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that senator wrote I was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\nWe need an FBI investigation of capital because you might have thrown ice in someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher nope you're up in our ...\nTotally missile total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that have Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe in the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four whenever it was\nNo that's not serious New York times during a peace right now on how he was part of a like party planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that base whoa oh gosh and he was a\nCollege kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times it's been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights on short too of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nBook by creating the storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flick and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree both flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented part as an assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them and the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale is costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing all that\nFlake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yeah I still receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger it's not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really\nFrom people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know big big big publishing house\nThat's that's what flakes game last year or so that's why I I'm concerned I don't know how the votes will go I'm not I have zero confidence and the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from\nBut because it is salacious\nThat you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it did\nI I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man or their things in there essentially telling you the sweat Nick is a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman\nIs crazy\nThat's that's the bottom line or and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard this line you know how many women have to be assaulted before you believe women\nThis is a\nThis is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're eight eight collective\nVersion of justice or a collective is to approach to justice that's at the heart of all this I Want to address that when we come back and then we'll talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our going

November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the center now and not in the house\nRepublican wave ... isn't that interesting\nRepublican wave is it possible folks that just as we saw on twenty sixteen the geo pie in the era of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations in this upcoming election\nI don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening to this to be fired up and be mad\nMad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on they're likely or to show up and vote people that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo\nThey figure out things are good things will stay good well what you said in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power and you can't have these people in charge you can't do it\nHave\nTo stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that it\nCould go either way and we're over a month out from election right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day Senate ... this is wherever and start saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics\nBob well Jill it all comes down to turn out you know blah blah blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundit is not telling the same things people keep asking me I mean I certainly hope they're probably gonna win but and you know what they're\nProbably gonna do it it's not like I think the world is going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and\nA way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for all of us right but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is the problem of the Democrats love the show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and all that stuff I mean I I Am wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me\nOr you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm given a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me I think the geo peas doing a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job it's not perfect not not\nBeyond reproach but you know there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's one point I wanted to make your in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact on it it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said\nAnd that means preventing Democrats from taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight\nThat's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they're going to be all agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats than women will turn out in huge numbers of cabinet gets on the Supreme Court I think the only woman who really believe that Kavanaugh is a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized voters a result of it have Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and metal decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find Sunday we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all a charade it's

do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do because that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for just like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just to vote\nFor a half an hour to get them out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with that that wasn't gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of courage that is called cowardice but notice how this is free\nThey're trying to you and this is very all top are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who are the ones who stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's seductive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life you'd be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concern with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing he would be in tremendous hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was a step beyond ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a chef\nSo what's it like do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a store rose funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day like is a self interest in power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's doing is just created additional risk for\nA man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been swine if you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper\nDoesn't understand apparently that's what Jake Tapper does know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to be able to go and get a contributor ship at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nA what the process here of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage ... chapters got an entirely wrong
