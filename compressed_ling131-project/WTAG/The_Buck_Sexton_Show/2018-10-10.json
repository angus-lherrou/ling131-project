not mean your half this does not mean that the senators account was hacked and the you know the generic sense of the word so the thing to do with these is just ignores them okay it's\nJust like you receive a spam email of fishing that tends to be either a\n... you know or the type of messages email\nAnd I'm going to be talking more about those on the Web and our today 'cause I'm doing those three free training weapon ours on a small business security if you haven't signed up and make sure you go to ... meters on dot com there's a sign up right on the home page\nBut according to the FBI Jim if you look at this message OK yeah and\nIt's a hoax and a lot of people recognize the grammar is kind of poor and wait a minute this looks weird\nBut according to the FBI for Fifteen billion dollars that's been stolen from small businesses because of that type of thing and I mean dollars from bank accounts not fourteen billion dollars worth of law were fourteen billion dollars stolen from

they and how do you do it\nWell and good timing him because of course as we just said you know passwords right yup on baseball I'm\nHearing the trick for years and years the advice has ... make sure you use are complicated password and change\nIt every Ninety Days like upper case lower case number ... um special characters and all this other stuff right that's what you're supposed to have done however and by the way that he'll what the hip offender say and that's\nStill what others Sanders this thing for the federal government has not caught up who ... of standards and technology who years ago they came up with his\nBottom line use a few were strung together so have a phrase three or four words that don't normally go together is a good way to do it for pay for rent kind of random ... were\nYou know and there's your password ticket that sure number or something in between them that\nIs the most your password that that is out right now show that the old advice so you know forcing people to change their passwords using round them letters and everything else those standards have now been proven to make passwords less secure\n... it's used for\nWork together you're going to string together like a I hard him than uh you know Craig\nBenny and under new password right yeah and and that that\nIs overriding decade of old advice if I'm full it's easy to remember which is important and it's almost impossible for computers the gas because there are so many characters evolve just you just think of that one particular string it's gotta be twenty thirty characters\nWow so that's the best kind of password yes ... ... that makes sense that makes that makes a lot of sense words that don't go together or the heights and stuff like that those symbols and how often do you\nChange that password though is that he said how often did you change the password\nOh well the beauty is it a good password and you don't have to write it down that you can get away with that password for a very long time we were talking about a year or two years even three years as long as you don't use it on any others that\nOkay this is this is general passport advice right there if that's the yeah you're right one of my FBI compatriots there are different than say right but for the normal\nAverage interests and\nYeah yeah exactly home user that the best possible advice that I think you'd get anywhere\nWell this is a great session Craig Craig beat her son are checked grew everybody okay so what you do if you want to get this kind of information on a regular basis and

Fox News category three hurricane Michael packing more than a hundred and twenty miles per hour winds and the potential for Thirteen foot storm surge is expected to make landfall tomorrow it'd be\nSo ah the reality of the U.S ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference why people are so focused on it now\nIs that Nikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has\nA ... you know people think of her as a minority female she is a minority females or you know she has\nMinority female or in her background or rather she is by background of minority female\nUm she's also liked by the establishment people think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump Administration officials who are not surprises Judy the beltway swamp types right I mean there's there's ... there's Nikki Haley\nUm there's\nTrying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the rules are in now in any administration that's going to the game you can Play Doh Kelly is chief of staff I mean there there are some people but\nCertainly are well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have 'em but the Trump Administration is non traditional\nAnd that is included a lot of nontraditional appointment but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be\nEstablishment approved a and so when she left initially when she announced her resignation there was\nA moment of oh my gosh what does this mean and as I said I don't think it means very much at all I think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks oh I was gonna say pumped but I\nI don't think pump pale would've been secretary of state in another minister ration but he's a former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I think ... great but you know he's somewhat of an established needs a Tea Party congressman I Know but still\nUh but I don't think ... this matters all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and\nAnd and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being very Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump using is increasingly\nI've always thought it was a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted that means is kicking button taking names so\nWhy also they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh ...\nBecause there's thought in the GOP that Nikki Haley is is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee\nNow let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here uh does anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six\nAnswers now you got no idea I Am I absolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do just come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation ... filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation is easy and cheap\nAnd so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on the Spitzer oh I think so and so it was going to run on ... part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying and Nikki Haley may run\nI'll be honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she's necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling a Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish in a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side\nWho achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be\nA lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh\nThat she was a a a gender traitor which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise] um\nBut I I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into political twelfth\nOut on the end of the airlines ... is that we make sure that everything is white and African fair to come and in fact in ... and the and I'm proud and part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour or six years and we got like a hurricane thousand year friday sitting bull hitting of some kind\nOf an ironic ... it's been a cat [laughter] I'm I'm a believer in her mind I think you have to be software for not for now when you\nFound in someone else to do the job [laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah there you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the British ration\nThat's why she's leaving folks I I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or stories and that and if if there is all certainly that you know but\nFor now it is what it is Nikki Haley's hadn't out doesn't really matter\nWho cares [laughter] that's my analysis of it I Know all book no wonder you're doing a but I I Do want to spend a little time with you on the\nMidterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now kind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and\nCreating permanent stability in and ... would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in in a war zones and overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset that is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the less going into these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment [noise]\n\nOut as one never missed a customer again when customers called text or

again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nCivility folks Hillary Clinton one of the leaders of the lives is out there telling people that\nFor civility to Richard in our politics Chavez holiday\nFor that to happen Democrats has to win\nThis is the problem we have right now with the political exchange between the two sides they are delusional\nThis reminds me of an of an editorial that I had been meaning to bring up to you or earlier in the week I Am so excited to talk to you on Monday could have been a few days than a skip right past us but the editor in chief of Politico\nWho I I don't I'm not even really familiar with I Know what political ... which is a political side left wing people a dozen bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a\nBut he wrote a piece about how maybe more or less it's time to to take the gloves off a about how ... maybe now is the time for Democrats to stop playing nice stop playing nice\nThey were accusing cabinet of being a gang rape is during Senate hearings these people are completely\nInsane they're completely nuts\nHow do you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do when people call you a Nazi because you're pro Second Amendment I said\nThere's nothing you can do don't engage 'cause you're talking you might as well be talking to the person who's pushing around the shopping cart with you know John three sixteen written on a piece of cardboard hanging out of it I mean that's\nThat's what we're up against now\nAnd this is unfortunately the end result of a massive media echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking\nSome form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on here\nPeople think that this is a normal way to approach their problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side should just go completely scorched earth insane\nAnd then they to borrow from the left the Democrats have normal lives they're crazy and it is they're crazy tactics and so what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a\nA nother network oh somebody friends with another network was saying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurant that's\nNot a mom I I'm Sorry that's them up if we can't agree and this was at\nCNN and I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm gonna let it\nJust uh 'cause 'cause I I like the I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it at some level if we can't agree\nThat the people that are changing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are\nPublic officials were laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for a ... if if they're going to laugh about that if they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens\nSent meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces everything else\nIf they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal we have no choice but to own the lips are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know how else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it that is the ... that is the only option there is no other option you know people who think that\nA gathering of angry loud ... gathering of angry loud activists in a restaurant yelling at somebody and you know in front of his or you know his wife or her husband or whatever is not a mob if we don't use the term up for that we have no basis for discussion\nThese these are just the basic laws of human nature and power the left does not believe in these things and they'll say oh but look at what about the equality in in Sweden first of all they think that equality just means having a large welfare state\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries of the left points to a there's not a huge emphasis on\nThis state enforcing the same outcome was for all people right I mean some people do better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes some people there's only so much the state is able to do\nIt unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful that you no longer have any individual rights you have whatever the state Dane to leave you um but I suppose I'm getting\nToo deep into this rabbit hole a here's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more so so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser Tucson loser for president never really done anything impressive in her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP the Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nSo a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listen to the show ...\nMany of you saw that very very early on I have not just come around to it now I I consider myself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way\nOf doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you win or bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nUh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time that CNN sits down the ... pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said her name's obviously I Know her name\nI just don't like to say that because it's ... ah not Christine it's ... and she told a friend of mine was a but they'll call he'll call Hillary out he doesn't sit there and and just allow or to get away with allies and the nonsense\nBut on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this me to moment\nAnd everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nI'm a porous Hillary about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to brass tacks place that\nHe said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the U.S who obviously you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband have a pet to answer this question I have a pet ... for them and how do you see that\nSo many different from what President Trump is being accused of cabin on others today\nWell there's a very significant difference I\nAnd that is the intense [noise]\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted\nIn the nineties [noise] if I'm On\nThe other Republicans starting with President Trump on down I Want to a comparison they should welcome such an investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician oh\nThere's a big difference alright between\nWhat happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or in the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with who did know him worth seeing him there\nThere's no question about where they were or do you ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that we never get answers for Ford\nBill Clinton\nWas accused of rape by Juanita broader Roderick by he was accused of sexual salvo Gennifer Flowers and these women came forward and said that he was a\nPredator a predator and\nSure enough Hillary not only didn't divorce him didn't you know you\nSay that those women should be believed she went on often against those women\nThe difference is not the investigation between cabin all and Clinton the difference\nIs that one of them actually is a predator and the author or the Democrats tried to sue me or as a predator that's the difference but Hillary is show dishonest in so disgraceful that she thinks she can get away with well one was a long investigation and the other you know there wasn't\nOne of them was being investigated for what he did while president while governor of Arkansas the other was being and being accused of stuff when he was a Seventeen year old kids thirty six years ago\nBut Hillary still thinks she can hit hit back at Trump for quote demeaning women play\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally\nIt further undermined the image and integrity of the court [noise] um and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because I ... and ... has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitutional government so\nI don't know how people are going to react to it I think given our divides it will pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against\nWhat the president's been true to form he has insulted attacked demeaned women um throughout the campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign and he's continued to do that or inside the White House\nYou know who else has has demeaned in insulted women folks Hillary Clinton\nWhen it suited her\nAnd you know what else is true and also said here on this show ... gonna be in trouble as long as the feminist left in this country embraces Hillary Clinton the feminist left cannot credibly there's that word claim to really be about empowering women [noise]\nEvery day I have the incredible honor and privilege upbringing you my thoughts you're on this program but I

little bit of research you find that these devices are programs\nBy Silicon Valley to be addictive you know they are studying behavioral science and behavioral psychology\nAnd breaking down ways for how many times we need to know how many times that we need to create something in this game so that it creates you know a ... for people to be addicted and how many times do we need to do X Y and Z to get people addicted to streaks and we're a bunch of puppet\nSo being a personal responsibility girl that I Am it was like oh I Want the free market to shut this down it was hey wait a minute just because you're designing these things to get us addicted doesn't mean that we actually have to to use them that way\nYou know what you're saying all this stuff it it just makes me think\nOf some of the uncomfortable recognitions about myself but I've had it's in the last year maybe year and a half\nWhere I realized things like I get a little ... and I don't know if the only ones I talked with some friends about it I mean I talked about on the show\nI feel anxious if I don't have my if I don't have my smartphone within reach\nI feel like I'm going to Mr Cole I'm going to miss an email something's going to happen I doesn't mean I have to look at it all the time although I Do look at it too much it means though that you start to have this I Need to be able to physically touch my phone or if there's something wrong I Know I'm not the only one\nRight and that and as you know if anybody who's done it the talks with food you know how you you go you're doing a juice fast for five days at first\nYou feel kind of sick you feel even more nervous because now you're you're pulling all this stuff out of your body that's bad that happens initially initially you have more anxiety 'cause you're like wait a minute what am I missing and might not plugged in I remember losing my phone and a taxi cab and I tell a lot of really\nEmbarrassing crazy personal stories in this book and one of them is that I lost it and a cat it was like I had lost the child or a dog or something that was alive I was completely untethered that was a sign that I hadn't I coined that phrase oh the the\nThe obsessive compulsive disorder people laugh but it's really really true and and and the thing is to you you and I around the same age back I think I'm a little older than you I don't know why it has brought that up maybe the audience can forget I just said that but\nThese are ... times and I look twenty five so for all intents and purposes she is twenty five go ahead my friend\nBut we come from a time where we grew up and we didn't have all this intrusion we didn't have all the social media we weren't setting staring at the cell phones\nWhat drove me crazy is thinking about kids getting into dating for the first time and they're doing it all on these phones\nParents should be worried that their kids are not learning basic skills I wrote an article for bus all this week saying you know I remember my middle school dance and the way that you know the boy had to kind of get the courage up across the middle school dance floor and asked me out and face the potential rejection and you know learn how to handle those face to\nFace conversations for the first time\nThese were the things that turn boys and girls and women and men and now you have kids hiding behind these devices they're they're not they're spread it completely than among a bunch of people things like intimacy and personal conversation or getting lost in those first relationship people have in college and and slightly beyond young kids don't they don't know how to have\nIn their personal relationships they don't know how to communicate anymore because they're doing everything by tax all the time so it's multi faceted the problem I'm having been a teacher for years I Can't tell you how many phones we confiscated and the bullying that goes on and social media\nHow people look at social media and they think it's we'll but\nIt's not if if I call it the perception deception like you think that somebody's real life but it's not it's what they chose to show you so I really go through all these ideas in a book and it's it's a reminder to you know if you yourself find yourself\nToo focused on these devices and fitting in between your your interest with friends or your relationships whatsoever you're dating or your phone conversations you're on the phone and there you are scrolling through your phone you know your your second phone or your your on your iPad\nOr you have kids and you're worried like what is just doing it on my kids don't buy outside my kids don't know how to talk to people anymore they don't know how to write properly because everything has gone through these tax this is a book for you to kind of grow discover and and maybe take some some of my depth and if not and that might hit and\nThen just having awareness that just because a product that rises doesn't mean you have to use it and B doesn't mean you have to use it the way they want you to use it it's really a self empowering talk\nIf you could get everyone listening as right now ... everyone should check out do not disturb ... new book out right now about how you can take back of your wife from these tech devices that are meant to overtake her life as she pointed out that they're actively trying to do that I mean the people designing them but if there's one rule I mean my my ... that I've been\nPretty successful implementing is no phones at the dinner table unless there's an emergency book do you do you have a rover folks were a couple of rules\n[noise] I mean the the main goal I Would say is that when you're spending quality time with people that I don't if it's in part than if it's added dinner if you go to your your your daughter's dance recital\nTurn those notifications off putting your phone away and if you have to take photos that this is another excuse people say all the time which I understand that they will I I Need my phone that's how I take photos\nCharting the other feature off learn to use the airplane not function on your phone I understand you want to have your own

try to divide us up based on the color of skin the country we were born in our religion our sexual orientation our general who tried to divide us up in every way possible\nAt the set off each against each other\nWe must do the same and create an international\nProgressive community that stands for social economic racial and religious justice for all\nThat's right Bernie Sanders\nWe're gonna come back we're going to come together will get a call for the wall border of progress but there's been\nA Bernie Sanders I I wanted to get away from the whole un climate change topic goes there's there are so foolish but there are so devoted to it\nNot just because of what they've been brainwashed into thinking about the threat to the planet I I wanted to know that that's there there's a whole nother component of this discussion which is that they think that climate change that pushing climate change hysteria is a way to get\nCloser to a one world government and and I know that's that sounds like crazy talk but there's also why ... why do liberals have such an affinity for the United nations the United nations has\nProven itself ineffectual so many times over at its core missions\nUh it it has not prevented genocide despite UN Mandate to do so it has not prevented armed conflict despite you know un efforts to do so and it often give some of the worst\nMost offensive an odious regimes on the planet cover for their activities because you know Libya will be on the human rights council or whatever\nYou know that they they have this fall the notion that all nations should be treated as somewhat equal when the truth\nIs that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there there's some crap hole governments and then there are some pretty good governments or at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good oh and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity and solidarity\nThat goes beyond any one nations sovereignty\nThe now now you're getting further along into what the progressive and state he is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nI that's why it's all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word among the less because\nThey think that a democracy is an idealized state of all people being equal in all ways\nWhich of course interesting to me is somebody who is a it has an interest in ancient history and and western civilization is if you go back to the ... the earliest democracy or ancient Athens in Greece\nOr they only had a very small percentage of the population that could vote you had to be a landowner you can be a slave there was a whole\nI had to be male obviously going to be ... you had to be a land owning\nA resident of all would essentially be the upper middle class to the upper class to be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority are ... by whatever the majority\nSays that is not really anything that will be a good government system you can imagine that extrapolating ... even further to what Bernie Sanders and others one of your which is all the countries of the world gets a vote on things\nAnd then we are held accountable to what all the countries of the world want I don't I don't want to be responsible for what it in any way I don't I don't care what European nations think about\nWhat my rights should be I I don't I certainly don't care what Muslim nations think my rights should be I don't care what the nations of East Asia think my rights should you know I just got on the list I don't care\nI Am not in any way bound\nTo their notions of uh my protections in in my citizenship under the law a fats and this is where the left starts to they they feel very differently about this they they think of themselves as citizens of the world they think of themselves as as a",
