{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Joining me now is the Republican who is running for that seat that Donald bash um held for many years ... senior has since died\nAnd now it's a race between the Republican Marie ... leads\nA and a Cheryl Coakley Rivera the Democrat joining me now is Marie good morning Murray thank you very I said your name right ... right\nThat's correct Murray shame on me as a you know not not getting this right to shame on me every time I said I said differently [noise]\nReally I find it at all the time there's a lot\nSo Murray let's get into this because Anthony I'm Ari the Republican he was running for secretary of the commonwealth came out to east long meadow and said hey this is ridiculous bill Galvin\nIf signatures on a sheet are obviously forged a written by the same person\n... this this this nomination she should be thrown out\n[noise] my understanding is that the first line of defense or the county clerks and Kamkar had to say we got the tenth on paper and they have to be a competitor Hitler to how we think it sure was registered [noise]\nA lot when we look at the paper trail I that was the same handwriting thing and ... or ...\nOr a whole new had on down the wrong address kind that led to other people made it clear or a guy on a farm bill that way and ...\nAll right let me let me explain this to folks are you gonna run for office the nomination sheets and I'm sure you've been to the supermarket and you walk up to the supermarket somebody says they ah would you sign the nomination she for Jim believe he's running for dog catcher\nAre you a registered Democrat or are you are registered Republican or whatever and then that she and and\nThe registry DJ need what Maria thousand signatures of thousand and say you went out and got them\nYes it's not an easy process\nNo that's not it's not that's why some candidates pay people actually to do it may be they paid for companies to go out and get the signatures from them like a quarter a signature so\nThey there were there's supposed to the town clerk's office was supposed to match the signature on the voter registration card to the signature on the\nForum on the nomination for him and miss obviously did mapping the Republican as a newspaper has looked into this they agree and you set it and bill gallons offices sector states that how you supposed to bring those challenges three days after they're certified\nRoom when we discovered that about a week ago that it was wrong at the time but we still felt that the important to burn up because it goes the heart of the discussion of qualifications for a job and also I thought the voters had the right to know about that\nWas a little shocked that Cheryl Cole glee Rivera who's been in politics going around the block a million times would have sloppy nomination forums like this\n[laughter] I was not expecting that are in fact we didn't challenge them way back in the gym because uh she was actually in the primary with a Mr Donald ...\nSenior and I'm sure yes yeah the senior he was actually still do that ... that's\nRight he has a way I'm Sorry\nYour he when he was very popular and um I imagine that they would I Would be than facing who would be the final candidate in September so we were a lot that deadline pass\nAnd it wasn't until a campaign um volunteer picked up the paper and said hold that there's a serious problem here and we looked at it and say this is quite we made it back a discussion\nWell who's so let me ask you right out and this is Marie and Julie she's Republican running for registered deeds and him and county are you saying that there was fraud or that the city elections office is incompetent in reviewing these forms which is\nActually two issues here one there was there were forgeries on it and we picked up the papers and first thing we did was call people we knew who think that you're obviously did not it was all nothing handwriting and they all said yes I did not sign those papers\nSo they can issue a fraud the other issue in regards to the process and a town clerk's were told that they were exposed to or even though things look strange that the rest of us to certify them and move on to the secretary of state's office\nSo the question is when is that decision made that the papers are can quickly filled out a way to do to you know\nCandidate planes weren't completed on one side at towns were complaining about I thought all these things wrap requirement and a whole page could be lost\nIf that were cross out so uh I Wonder if that I thought I had to all our weren't the rule that I guess are in play right now so I think that all has to be clear that so that's two different issues\nBut the main reason I brought it up now before the election is thicker than water when it comes to registering gates office following\nTo the letter is really important so even though we're halfway through early voting absentee ballots have already voted on I at this as a political thought I thought it was important issue or I Can't let fraud and portrayed by by without it being brought to light\nWhere Murray so [noise] I guess what I'm getting at here is\nThe Republican has said has given examples\nThat would be fraud if if they're true like the doctor from long ago I mean that looks to me like fraud what do you think\nOh definitely they said they signatures were there for traits on the paper\nThe issue with uh I Do know where the investigation going to go they right now the investigation has to go and get a handle the secretary of state we're both from the air\nA would be depended on who has standing in regards to following up with uh the ... century which could either be the secretary eighth office or the people who think they were actually um I went out for ... ... again\nBut we are hand in all of this over to the secretary of state's office and asking for a complete investigation\nOkay now what about the offices that didn't catch this the clerk's office is that didn't catch this\nWay were specifically told not to uh you know not to go ahead and certify any names as long as the address and the name of spell correctly\nAnd in fact some of them were not a certified because they actually had incorrect spelling of the names or the addresses a about that or the direction that they receive from the secretary say right\nNow um my concern is we're we're going to have him or requesting watcher Springfield Ross requesting uh besides the papers were coming out a failed rats infantry all of the register of voters\nAre and the reason we're entering that off with a conflict there and let the right to start was the former aide to a state representative shark lived there and we just feel it would be clean air to complete the election process are asking her to step aside and they had the fake companies keep an eye on the call\nIs there a debate or coming up soon as they are on a friday night is there a debate\nYes we have a debate friday with requests and debate and candidate forums for out this\nWhole election period and she has said too busy for them but we do have one friday twelve thirty probably the very last debate that will be hurt on channel twenty two and I'm looking forward to being able to ask questions of the other candidate\nWill will be looking for that to Marie ah and ... Murray where can people\nGet more information on your a campaign for registry deeds\nA website or Facebook and Marie and they are I eat the number four games B. E. T. S. dot com\nAll right Marie thank you very much thank you take care you're listening to the gym plead ocean you're safe space\nOpportunities present themselves every day\nIn your home either\nIn the air force reserve\nThis is rich car host of the financial freedom show nine AM Saturday here on news radio double duty AG from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nTemperatures will be the lowest thirty for Wednesday mostly sunny with a high around sixty degrees Wednesday that the clouds coming Los dropping to the upper forties for Thursday mostly county maybe a chance of rain with high in the lower sixties you can get your forecast anytime a W Gigi dot com keyboard whether using executive\nPower I'm Lisa and the camera Fox News President Trump considering ending a policy where children born in the west to parents who are illegal immigrants are automatically us citizens Democrats slamming to plant\nWell you're not going to bring the temperature of the rhetoric down you're not going to lessen the outrage in our discourse by just being\nMore angry more destructive in more hateful than ever that that that's pretty self evident media figure that out they were on the one hand say Trump needs to stop being so political in his speech\nAnd then the other said Trump is Trump has blood on his hands and these are media organizations you don't even pundits really there's a whole whole new up and they'll say Trump has blood on his hands because of this or that terrible thing\nBut it gets even worse um I I saw this yesterday and I rarely do I have a ... do I have a wild moment watching CNN or MSNBC these is rarely made it happens but I'm sure you do them\nSmearing the president so used to just that everything is race is everything is white nationalist average you know this is ... at a at a certain\nLevel it's also just so boring and repetitive you know they're not even creative anymore and the way that they hate the president it it's just they're all repeating each other and then they're all just trying to outdo each other\nWith the the worst and nasty stuff they can think of to say and this has become a this to become its own little industry who can think of the most outrageously anti Trump thing to say on national TV but I think ... I think we've got a winner\nIn Julie or your father or your coffee\nWho I did not know this or had been fired from Politico for a tweet suggesting that the president commits incest and she was very coarse language not just as the thoughts disgusting but the president commits incest with his own daughter\nThat's that's who political head on staff yeah she got fired because I guess even for the live media there are some limits to how protest they can be and still be quote unquote journalists but Jake Tapper owes so famous fake tapper\nOh show serious tapper who just can't stop chin wagging about how he's the most uh you know down the middle you know Ernest gum shoe journalist ever\nOh and oh by the way you know how much you love charity and the troops let them tell you a hundred times a day it was just you know enough Jake we we get it\nOr you know this is a guy though who is ... Ito will get very gets very aggressive with conservatives on a regular basis gets very aggressive with other people around the president calls them alcohol them for being liars and all this he has ... on a show and does not stop her\nOr challenged her at all when she says the following yesterday play quip one\nYou know that's passed that at one of the things that ... where they launched his presidential run on as talking about Islamic rattle radicalization of\nThis president has radicalized sell many more people than ISIS Africa I mean the way he talks the way say the way that is that's just it it it's a hot the way the way I see a allows the way he was ...\nYeah that's right presidents radicalized more people than ISIS now now I I Know that there's there's some people who might say hold on a second book you know if you're if you think that being a conservative as radical and they tried to rationalize isn't some way but none of what she just did there\nWas to compare the president and therefore his supporters who she says had been radicalized goes\nSo far there's only been one radical that we know of who's actually been violent who's a Trump supporter one out of sixty three million that voted for Trump never mind those who didn't vote for him but think he's great it was a lot of those do\nYou got one that we know of we don't have people run around in the streets like we do with anti fall in large numbers causing mayhem and the name of Trump you know that's all on the left we don't have anybody who's actually harmed and come very close to assassinate\nAs being a a member of the opposing party as we do with these Steve ... shooter Don Lemon treated out today that he can't even imagine a Democrat being violent\nSteve ... retreated that just with with these eyes looking up at the sky like are you kidding me Don Lemon multimillionaire newsman image also Trump's right he's just not don't let me just not very smart and he's very insecure about that because he's just not just not very smart\nBut\nYou know you look at the way that this conversation happens and and and the way that the left tries to frame it and you know you off a decides that ... whatever she decides that the way to get attention here and she succeeded in that regard it should just go even crazier than everybody else\nThe Islamic state ran a totalitarian caliphate for a few years that in slave millions of people that engaged in massive kidnapping torture and rape operations as a function of of war and policy like they did that systematically\nA murder or at least tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people if you were to really kind of a mass graves horrific televised torture executions\nAnd she thinks it's she thinks that it's in any way rational and reasonable to compare Trump and his radicalized supporters to the Islamic state in in any context\nNow the only defense that I can come up with for free yeah your coffee here\nAnd she's indefensible but I mean the only way that you could really try to explain this as well there are so many people in the left that casually compare Trump to Hitler at this point casually compare\nTrump to you know the third Reich and uh and and and say that there's all this this rise of white nationalism and Nazis and that's occurred under Trump\nMother you know I remember when Brock Obama was president and there were all these all these stories\nFrom the uh you know the Southern Poverty Law Center on these other groups all others is terrible rise of white nationalist groups because of Obama\nAnd nothing happened for eight years in the white nationalist there's like fifty losers no one pays attention to really or just pathetic and want it and want attention you know the white nationalist are really the equivalent of like the Westboro Baptist church but the media makes it out to\nBe oh it's discouraged are coming for us that are going to take over everything and\nThey're just delusional ... well it's not even that the visual they're they're really cynical because this serves their interest their interest is to make the white nationalist seem like\nThey're much bigger than they are much more menacing than they are because that's a means of of attacking Trump [noise] but yeah you off he came back after that break and said that you know she got a little to eat ... Jake Tapper\nMust have in the ... control and make sure gotten as you're in the city and you can't\nIt's much cancer that with the President's Day and we and we're going to keep pretending remember this isn't even on a quote opinion show trapper runs [laughter] it's laughable but to ever runs a a straight news show which is a joke and it's just a total joke\nUm but you know if you were honest about what you'll notice how much less go after\n... O'Donnell and you know I even I even had a a you know a pretty ... I wouldn't say friendly but a pretty um well behaved debate with\n... we're on on rising recently you know I'll engage with people were honest about what they are I just don't like frauds and CNN oh I'm just a nonpartisan journalist brigade there are a bunch of frauds tappers leader of the pack I mean Cooper's right there with them but just frogs and what they do every day uh and uh you offer\nObviously it's just a symptom of a larger problem is you know which is that they're not honest about what they are and what they're doing I just wish they'd stop lie that maybe people will listen to the president was [noise]\n\nHow does one never missed a customer again when customers call or email expressed to me automatically engages them with your digital content\nSimple tax flyers

office that attracted him point today's workforce once in office has no an accurate down day standing desk solution between them\nA you know to be essentially a utility instead of a publisher and this is where the big distinction comes in at least in that environment you could have conservatives do reasonably well because concert or do very well in the case of places like Facebook or because it's all a market based right what if people want what do people want to see and watching\nAnd who they want to engage with them what do they want to say\nAnd you know the Internet used to be this place where we increasing the thought of it as the most open marketplace of ideas that had been and could ever be devised\nAnd now we're seeing as well no actually they're very few relatively speaking very very few sites where a vast majority of Internet activities occurring and if you control those notes of activity and the way that speech you shared all those places Facebook Google Twitter\nThen you have an enormous amount of control of conversation I mean it's really like we've gone back to\nYou know the Nineteen sixties the Nineteen seventies when there were only a handful of channels in the broadcast news networks were the only news and whatever they decided was was what people thought reality was\nUm but this idea that that Silicon Valley or it has has these people who remember Google's model used to be don't be evil which is I've always thought I always thought that was very telling because if that has to be your\nMotto there's something there's something going on but when I when I look at this this current trend and obviously we have a a great sponsor on the show that started a new social media platform that that explicitly says we are not engaging the left wing censorship\nPeople understand that you know if you can get together with you know fifty a hundred thousand you know other conservatives in one place and share ideas is that may be much\nMore fruitful place to\nGo and share ideas than to be in this massive multi billion person ecosystem where you don't really know what you're getting and where it's coming from and who's in charge of determining what you see which may be dot com by the ways that site that's that that's the uh the platform that sponsor here on the show and they're they're a new social media network\nBut the need for this is very ...\nAnd ... vt age when he says that we shouldn't interest Silicon Valley with this stuff ah he's completely right I mean there's there's just no way this ends in anything other than conservatives that he massive disadvantages or a you know Trump's twenty twenty campaign manager\nA heat earlier today Brad par scholar looks\nLike a a a Brooklyn barber slash arches cocktail maker a you know he talked about the Palo Alto mafia and the censorship a concert as you're talking to this on on CBS this morning\nThese are real things that are happening and it ... it reminds me of how at a place like CBS or NBC back in the day they didn't think they were biased\nAnd that was the really the the main underlined pointed Bernie Goldberg would work at CBS for a long time then became more of a Fox News stable and a conservative\nBut you know the the part of this that liberals didn't understand was that they thought that they were being objective they were so biased as to be in capable of understanding and accepting the degree of biased in their journalism which is a whole level right it's it's one it's all level beyond\nIt's one thing just say I know that I'm actively pushing for one side or the other and I'm making a conscious decision\nIt's even more pernicious when you push for one side and the debate over the other and you don't even realize you're doing it\nLike yeah you know I'm just I'm just just the facts you know this is this is Apple's not bananas are the bananas not apples whatever it is over it and CNN [noise] so I I I Do think this is a the finally this is the time and we understand that we're going to have to find workarounds or at least have greater understanding\nOf what's going on at these places because think about it this way if if a small I ate really infinitesimal amount of money spent on Facebook ads by ... by some Russian a troll farmers if that\nCan be thought to sway an election what do you think Google and Facebook can do and by the way do entirely legally that's much better than in many ways in in ... contribution to one side of the other\nThe answer is they can sway an election\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] that was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw\nSome getting twenty five and thirty thousand people to these rallies nobody's ever seen that has never been an official bragging that has never been anything like what's happening I went to Illinois ... only seven forty said this massive hangar pack\nAnd that is a second here for the overflow nobody's singing and always look what happened for Ted Cruz is doing great how we left to send these linguist\nThat's right it's not\nHi can you tell them I get is McGill is just all over the place how's it looking for the midterms is the Trump\nEffect is going to carry the day is the cabinet wave still assessing answering these questions and more we have with us now Betty Johnson reporter at the Daily Caller Mr Johnson good to have you back\nPay but thank you so much for having me on so\nDo you think that they're going to be a lot of lives eating Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream or on election night in order to to do all the hurt and and deal with all the tears or they go in the house or how we look in right now\nYes Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream actually comes with a warning label on the back that says it does taste better if you're\nCrying liberal tears into it and you mix it up and the extra salty any extra sweet\nIt goes together beautifully that's good my and I think there's gonna be a lot of that election night but there are trending polls upward for Republicans nationwide you have a lot of races\nAre particularly after the calving off the Kavanaugh fact you mentioned earlier a lot of races that were toss up a swinging right a lot of races that worse steady down that have swung to toss up a\nLot of races that Republicans seemed doom and Democrats seem to be able to cling onto his seat that has now won um massively in that direction of the pie as\nWe were elected a these polls are tightening ... races like in Tennessee races I'm like in Missouri but it really is trending upward for the ...\nYou think that a Ted Cruz is gonna from an electoral perspective kicked the skateboard\nOut from under ... and tell them the Sylvie heavy stuff in the lab\n[laughter] there's actually a viral clip from Ted Cruz yesterday the republic on the Daily Caller or where he where he told or where he told a a a reporter who asked him about Texas getting their first Latino senator uh what is there a shortage is there a shortage of Irish men in the U.S Senate\nBecause beta of courses are actually Robert Francis O'Rourke is very very Irish and Ted Cruz's halfway between\n... and married to a billionaire by the way how does that not really ever get reported until now I've been reading about this guy for months I just found out that he's married to a billionaire families and tends to with his own financial interests are at stake side with the plutocrats over the people but he was shocked about ... Cho\nBook what a shock I mean what else have you done this a billionaire who's very tall billionaire versus federal how could but the millionaires and billionaires from his campaign practice with\nBlue I didn't know if you remember the count like count Dracula thing there that was Bernie first I'm Glad we figured out it was it was Bernie but I Do feel like I Do feel like Bernie I'd rather\nBe Joe or got got kind of a pass for being incredibly wealthy comes up every time I see this guy he's got the rolled up sleeves and he's been described as Kennedy asking I'm like oh so he's a silver spoon or\nWho's running around with a nickname for the culture that is not his own okay that's interesting\n[noise] yeah well correct at least as these on a skateboard there's less of a chance for him to hit someone while drunk driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them and\nThen he could still flee the scene on a skateboard my friend do think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but the police report it was alive remember that but it was a lie\nThere you go to ... always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWhere we are expecting Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for your ... who do you really care about seeing gets a W on election night was only a few days away but I mean who who is you get W by their names are you going to say it's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta now what that is is just\nPosition recorded twenty that was the candidate a liberal journalist right now are writing the state law but he actually won right shout out to the journal is right now that are that are already have that piece prepared because they do is down by double digits in Texas\nOr this just isn't going to happen for him also the president of course is who is monster campaign or an Israeli actually moving the needle her a lot of close races the president's going to do a ten day I attend a campaign stop blitz or the next seven days up to election day\nIt has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years as helpful meant that\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nDirectly I got the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national audience daily say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the pay for rent this bio climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresidents opposite racist these other to demagogue he out of the condos anti Semitism stokes a national thing this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and\nWhat they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to change any of our tactics they're not trying to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement\nThey're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail why would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to any of this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know state paid for healthcare and state paid for\nCollege which means you pay for the question of how much and who\nAnd then let the may ... of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this\nThey did this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election\nOr they were\nAnticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans and they're so terrible on a show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough I think to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case 'cause there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high five to well if you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class had no\nIdea what's happening and so basically an editor already occurred on election day right so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not but you're obviously not going to change your mind based on what they said no matter what no matter what right um because you see the result\nBut I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election and a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house has has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not on that side of the most important election of our lifetime that it's not true okay that'd be ... then it stopped with that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election it'll probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty sixteen\nSo it's one I Want to go probably the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this midterm shakes out and and that's why I just think it's so noticeable that Democrats aren't even at the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good\nCandidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues as like the Joe mansion effect how is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes to unions\nI you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are pretending to be\nA more centrist than they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be\nOr what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about how protecting\nProtecting preexisting conditions on Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from the left his trumpet trumpet as a racist these terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop so that's why whatever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if Trump would want what stopped being Trump's and you'll like him this is nonsense there's ways of everybody's time oh am I mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my lifetime uh I like the trumpet it say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that it\n[noise] so far I like 'em all\nI don't see anybody right now and I should shut down and\nI like to send me very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth is nobody right now that Trump looks at across the aisle thinks\nOh wow I don't know if I could ... I think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThis is nobody there's nobody that's even close I the only one who you think maybe it's enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national\nLevel the west are going to like him so that's a pretty big vulnerability but you know you're burning coal to you talk to me ... ... but when you find out you're gonna have to pay Seventy percent of your income in taxes I I don't think you're going to want to feel the burn quite the way he does [noise]\nSecurity breaches happen all the time now you may be thinking well it's usually is a big company and\nWho knows if the

it's the priest gets prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're telling me\n... it's it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained illegally and being made illegally so\n... is is that an accurate reader of what's going on here because it is being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not\nBeing filtered through Pfizer

you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with ... with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing\nBut what what happened was as soon as those\nIssues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in Dr stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own till they're owned pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pill so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da ... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\n... look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an ex it looks like a Xanax that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real Xanax it's not a real purpose that it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking notes for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive and two lives lost\nBut when you see it come talented with the enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure but you you hear about this all the time but sat in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose in die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt of that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example in April this year in Nebraska and state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds at that and all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcased\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcased in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcase that they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close up this theater right now and they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know without on the streets we have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happen before we lose a generation\nAnd of our kids and we have to face it and we have to be honest about it [noise]\n[noise] serve this this documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people that have been affected by this and in any respect it's ... it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before\nWhat what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in at it\nIn all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child as a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing goes right away so we can save lives\nAnd that people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriate at the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic\nThat there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the bass array of of our of our money pet but that it's actually working\nThat we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that at this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in Dane\nB. E. I. N. nodded gain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's gains and into our children's game and we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua's Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nOrganization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives\nOf millions of people and we have to start treating it that way\nWhether that putting up the wall building the wall\nOr enforcing laws on international laws and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I\nCan't tell you about how many parents I Know that have no idea that this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that these pills are manufactured in trailers that that our kids are purchasing step\nThat the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical or prescriptions a that what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home that it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nFor conservatives to live under right I mean do do we have mutually assured destruction to end PC or\nDo we act like adults and say you know we're just not going to do that and they all need to just you know everyone just needs to come down I'll be honest with you I go back and forth on this one I have some days rom like you know what if they're going to force us to wallow in the PC nonsense we gotta we gotta pull them right in there with us\nA but then I buy the days when I'm like oh I just I don't know if the way to fight lives is to become showed trigger a bowl so easily triggered like like lives are all the time I don't know I I can I'm convinced ... either way on this one I can be convinced of of either\nFeel like it's getting it's convincing below word Brandon what was I made up of great word the other day on the air and akin or ... or a instead of derogatory I liked that one ... does not sound like a fancy word though it's French\nYeah they've got to read may we'd be able to but I I I feel like\nHonestly it convinced ... should be a word if it's not so I I should check that one out it's just like decide or you know I got to have some ... and those will be word that I come up with that I say you know cooked and we do know the dictionary but they should be\nA and I think invincible should be is is one of them for sure about\nIt is in the dictionary I think\nThat exactly this will get about it if that's going to be the dictionary\nDocuments will should be in the dictionary so where where where we got all this Oh yes that's right Hillary we all know that she's probably going to run again but this is where we get into you know one of the one of the big asset\nThat the the left has whenever they're running for office or their somebody in public life you know the public persona\nIs when there's something get treated as a joke versus when is it treated\nSeriously and and when it's someone given the benefit of the doubt\nBy the media you know the narrative the conversation that people have based on what they're reading what they're being told what they're hearing when's that benefited out given to somebody versus when are they to be made an example of which is the obviously the opposite of the opposite effect of all that\nAnd the truth is it's a\nIt's still very much the case that lives pretty much across the board get the benefit of the doubt and then some and conservatives just get crushed and I find that frustrating and this this reminds me of a Lindsey Graham is saying well the only way to get lifted\nChange is to\nDrive them from their villages and here the limitations of their women so to speak ah here's what he here's what Lindsey says about this like looked at\nThe American people have had it with this I've had with it\nKavanaugh the care of that and blaming Trump for everything under the side if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're gonna changes for them to lose ... cabin on the main anything and if you don't want anymore Kavanaugh character assassination\nOr then you need to reject what they did and hand them that the state they deserve they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them and the only way they'll get it as for the American thankful send out loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their tax they've had blaming every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement\nIt really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning really is a political strategy and I noticed that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle mentally it just got the left to say oh great we're winning\nScrew the other guys from comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect\nIt's not going to be pretty but if we want them to change we've got to win Lindsey Graham is saying that too and you know what Lindsey Graham two point oh is correct [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for so long and never saw [noise] there's a big controversy is no doubt about it\nThere are some issues that get way more attention than they probably should and the media just latches onto them for any number of reasons the controversy over candy corn is something that people are now really weighing in on this dishes turn newest thing by the way ... Brennan candy corn delicious are disgusting\nI actually am a big fan of it\nYou'd like candy corn ... see I always think that candy corn is a declaration that you have in your candy bag at a trick or treat her for all the candy that you actually want to eat right John Candy corn for me it was always almost like\nThe ornaments on a Christmas tree there not edible they're just there to look pretty uh but some people apparently eat candy corn and you are you are among them which I find I Can't say shocking\nBut sorry I've disappointed ...\nIt's okay it's okay you know I mean I I have my own you know I ... you know that there's this video going around that shows the reason I call candy corn is because if you build it into a circle it looks like a corn on the cob did you know that I've seen that yeah yeah it is do we agree that that's why it is called that I don't I don't know if anyone's ever given up an official ruling on it\nFor those who were curious the first ever candy corn was made in the uh according to the national confectionery association candy corn was invented the Eighteen eighties and Americans obviously have been into it ever since and it it's just sugar\nIsn't it it's kinda like it's it's a sugar that's been a little bit\nUm you know\nSugar flavor and I don't know I don't even know what you'd say about it it takes a\nWeek sugar it's just and nice in Chile I I I don't understand the hate to be on someone called the ...\nEar wax and it got a lot of that got a lot of attention on on Twitter or I I Would just say this you know we were having a discussion today on my um we're having a discussion say on rising about scariest scary movies and I said number one for me is The Exorcist you know obviously we've\nGot Halloween tomorrow and you know I don't know how much I'm really going to be able to get into any kind of Halloween stuff\nBut you know The Exorcist is a scary movie for me that I've ever seen I really I keep telling myself every year that I'm going to watch the ... and then I'm like I think I'm gonna watch a rerun of friends instead you know I just I don't really but you're probably a scary movie guy written because you're you're like you got that punk rock revive right you probably were in the Rob Zombie back of the day\nI still like Rob Zombie any make our movies I like his versions of a Halloween and out of a thousand corpses and double oh ... yeah you're\n...
