a generation now where we're supposed to understand that when somebody is a a junkie an addict\nYou have to treat them with compassion they're not responsible for their actions unless of course\nTheir seat this is what it is the last points it the right and says you're racist you how could you attack someone with mental illness how could you criticize someone who Cindy cap but all of those rules go out the window\nWhen it's their turn why are they so vicious to Kanye West this is your safe space\nESPN what life for an on demand for\nWith the original and the entire thirty for\nMade it I really feel it Sarah Fox news reports about the fate of missing Saudi journalist Yamanaka showed\nGear now multiple reports the Saudi Government is putting together an explanation to acknowledge that ... show he was killed during an interrogation that went wrong and that the real intent was to a doctor show he and bring him back to Saudi Arabia\nThe generals who are well or really well thought of by the media\nTends to be\nPeople who won cultivated a certain persona with the media and chew also are a little more shall we say willing to take a\nA point of view that would be well received by academia and the media on a\nWhole bunch of things I've noticed is before generals started to get very political and journals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon\nA vet for example\nA lot of the stuff that came out of a general Patrice\nI was not surprised by it'll cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying for his own purposes to to create this narrative of betray us as the the greatest military might have a generation I Would\nIt would just point out that before even are being brought low by an extramarital affair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't do it all the stuff that you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixed Iraq but his strategy\nOr was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work I Would note that the strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work was not working and was never going to work\nAnd he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case so while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all those credit for Iraq we also have to look and\nSee the situation in Afghanistan I understand that he's not that portrays was not this uh men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond approach period but also when it came to this rather so that's my that's my saying I Need to do a little more\nI Need you a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much\nPositive stuff about matters for so long and maybe he just rather present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to call him a Democrat I also they've kind of funny that the president\nUses calling somebody a Democrat is kind of a a little sly a you know\n... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat yeah it's like when I say in my uh my media life my guys okay it's kind of a communist\nSo Trump's today is kind of a Democrat he also said that you know that\nTrump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to\nWe need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have\nThe right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love the White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back then I say hold on a minute given what we know about\nAll the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including Republicans who are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump at all we know that there's somebody right now who roads if you if you believe in New York Times and\nI don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the non editorial as we never found out of this guy was\nThe anonymous editorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody as White House of course it would be silly to do that and that's also why I'd give more leeway than I Would then other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence\nPeople who are ... post to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become Turner coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circles I mean you're talking about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing Trump's anymore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump\nIs in I think it would be insane\nFor the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me anything it was really some of them you know telling you what I mean it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade\nOf you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better you know they're like off the record a volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so\nI guess so ah and then you know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview or had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position a since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that uh you know still the same thing they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's as well do it's the law and I don't think\nThat they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's\nThe law is to say that it's actually the Congress that does bear some of it's not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either inept or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is to find a way to adjust the law\nThat it's a bad law or to repeal it entirely is it really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration\nFor him when he felt frustrated with Congress ... articles er Cox I'm like well what am I correct\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislator branch's authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcement it's not just about enforcement when you don't enforce something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted\nBy Congress and I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the press puts aside pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be or they would be just crushed because of what had been going on at the border and I think that they miscalculated\nThat for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told that you know immigrants or do jobs or what time in legal now folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy\nAnd they would like to have some re establishment of the rule of all when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has been build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews the pro check their bail ability even book appointments online and when my wife love most is at home and visor is completely free to you go to ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nI often\nTalk to you about what's going on in the world when it comes to technology and how to live a scene happy and healthy life even though I'm not sure I Know much about any of\nThose things but our next guest who is a dear friend and media rock star can actually tell you some things that might make your life a little bit better ... isn't that nice isn't it fun just to die of below the one and only is with us now she's the author of a new book just out hashtags\nDo not disturb how she goes to her cell phone and took back her life gender diet great to have you as always\nThanks so much for having me back always great to be here isn't it ... back to the early days at the blaze you were just like we're both do it early Fox heads and now ... you know all\nOf the view as well as Fox News as well as author what what brought you to write this book\nThis was my passion project often times in this industry when people decide to write a book because editors come to them and say\nHey this would be a really great topic for you to write about you know because of what you're talking about on TV and what not this was something I actually when I realized I had an addiction to technology I went from being one of those people who loved conversations face to face\nTime you know going into the countryside and hanging out on floods\nInteracting with people face to face focused engaged to someone who was constantly distracted by cell phone I pat\nSocial media to a point where I wasn't sleeping while anymore it was getting up in the middle of the night on my bathroom breaks to check Twitter the check social media to have that tax by with an ex boyfriend to save my last piece through an email to to a colleague at work and I I was my body was suffering my mind was suffering and I decided you know what\nI Want to change this ad I Want to figure out why this is happening why are we so addicted and be I Want to take some steps to make that easier and I want to show people this does not have to be something that gets fixed through\nGovernment regulation or government involvement or oh we're going to step in and we're going to make a whole bunch of rules and laws this is something that needs to get fixed through people making a decision to change the way they use the technology that life can be itself empowered to um\nYou know make these changes that I felt that it kind of like a personal responsibility manifesto for twenty eight feet [noise]\nWow well what what happened when you started actually taken back responsibility away from the machines [noise]\nSo what I did was I started small you know everybody said oh you know how you gonna do that I started small and I turned off the notifications on my phone which was amazing you have to ... you can still go into those states that you can decide hey I Want to be active on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook but\nIf you don't have that constant stream of notifications beckoning you to those sites you have a lot more peace of mind you feel much more in control of those faces I took the phone out of the bedroom and I said you know what when I go to my bedroom I usually go in about an hour before that I hang out and now I watch either you know old\nFriends episodes or I read a book or I just kinda chill out that was a time I didn't want to be staring at the phone and what research shows actually that's really interesting is that even if you are not on the phone if the phone is by you even if it off and there's no notifications coming through nothing you are\nPerturbed you are distracted because you are compelled to want touched that phone to want to look at that divide so I just remove it from my face I also did something really simple when I was with friends I said you know what\nI'm going to try something for these three hours I'm just going to put the phone in my bag and I'm not going to worry about it I'm going to take an actual break I'm not going to run on my bathroom break you know while we're waiting for dinner to calm and check every possible feature on the phone I'm just going to get my mind a chance to arrest and when I started\nTo see the impact that I really said wow there's something she was\nFrom the double duty AG whether sitter here's the latest forecast\nShows like the receiving losing the mid forties for Tuesday's Sony with ... these Tuesday mostly ... around forty degrees for Wednesday mostly sunny ... the mid fifties you can get your forecast anytime a WTO gee dot com key word whether [noise]\n\n\nBack when you know because when it comes to the fight for so long [noise] never saw\nSomething really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're going to have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment\nWhat happened you journalist ... ... the\nEntire world seems absolutely shed on trying to get an answer to that question\nWhat what what happened to this man how how was it that he was able to uh disappear from the Turkish consulate\nIn in in ... were other for me it constantly Saudi conflict in ...\nAnd now we have this very real looming international relations crisis on our hands or how did we how did we get to this point how do we find ourselves in a situation where we have to deal with\nYou know the the president has raised the possibility of rogue killers 'cause the presidents\nI'm sure he said that he spoke to a king Solomon behind the scenes keep in mind the king of Saudi Arabia is a pretty uh what's the word in from old\nMen at this point it's really a NBS Mohammed bin Solomon who is the thirty three year old crown prince he's the guy who runs stuff and he's the one who has done this whole charm offensive in this country in big business in big media and big government all being buddy buddy with and the ... so that's\nWhy this is such a shockwave through the elite communities the the Davos set is little oh my gosh we do know we can we can have the Saudis funding trips for us anymore\nUh and and there's there's the reality of what this tells us of Saudi Arabia which is interesting and I'll get to that um and and there's also the pending\nProbably will be the case at some point when you watch the ... when you listen I'll watch when you listen to the show I Will have confirmation of it but as of right now it sounds like they are planning to say that this was a rogue elements within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nOn the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus I've also seen early reports that it may be a it may be the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went over the line\nUm but the Saudis can hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that's that's the latest on that so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep the assembling on is that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a jam here um as I should be the Saudi regime is\nA terrible and ah and disgusting government but we're not really often told that because they have a tremendous amount of sway even our own media they own a lot of shares a lot of very important media companies but\nHere's what you see the ... the payment that's going to happen it's already started to happen because you have this issue of a repressive fatalities Harry in\nMuslim how often do you hear about that a Muslim majority nation not just the Muslim majority nation entirely Muslim nation the most Muslim country by percentage I Believe in the world I mean maybe Somalia I mean there are a couple of other countries that are right up there but the Saudis do not allow non Muslims\nJew beep you know citizens of the peninsula I mean the Saudis are did they do not allow Christian worship or ceremonies were houses of worship to be a Jew can be built on on Saudi led so this is a a hyper Islamist\nGovernment which you don't ever hear hyper Islamist regime and I talked to a little bit about that\nHoly but unholy alliance between the ... hobbies or the Salafis fundamentalist Islam and is Bedouin tribe\nA house of Saud that as the Saudi regime Saudi royal family so you know there's all this complexity on the issue but but here's what what's happening right now\nThis is going to quickly become a crisis that ... that is much more about what Trump does for our media than what it really means I'm already hearing you know\nBecause Trump ... up with dictators that's why this happens this is the line you're there's all the time Trump is so is coddled dictators here here's what I Want to say to anybody in response to that cause you'll hear this all over the place the media next few days I don't think it's possible to call dictators\nMore than Obama did I I think it'd be very hard you'd have to work really hard to do so because Obama made some very clear errors in dealing with authoritarians in strongly for one is his word didn't mean anything\nWhen it came to consequences the erasing of the red line in Syria led to a free\n[laughter] have you tried to mention education activities in your ... and take the planes run\nFor more information on how you can celebrate mended than we gee [noise]\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct none no now we're all in retrospect do you think [noise]\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you that where's the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations had been made and what shape dismisses denies and ridicules [laughter]\nThat's what she had nothing to do with anything you see\nIt was only her husband who was a serial abuser of women who was credibly accused of sexual assaults by women on the record with full facts and the stories ready to go\nMedia didn't want to cover that you see this is where I I I just I I take a moment because I Want to step back and make sure we all around the same page when it comes to the narrative of the moment here she the narrative\nOf the moments in the left is that oh what Bill Clinton did then she would never be able to do now you see it's different because of this me too movement it's different now Bill Clinton's\nOr what will be called the ... what what is left to call them his his personal failings very ... way of saying Bill Clinton being a predator\n... myself when I was just you know I mean on Okonjo showed a curse word the oval office but all too much much worse stuff in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace\nOr it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... he's a hundred million dollar men now at ABC\nNews anchor that has to be ... who decides to pay that much money it's it's a it's an astonishing thing really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows are platforms wherever they putting these roles is going to get a certain amount of\nViewership but he seems to get a excused from being a part of the country machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I Want it back I mean Hillary just\nWas finally told you don't get to have a security clearance anymore for cereal and flagrant violations of national security protocol for anybody who has a clearance she was just told that now she still hasn't\nRaised show has been achieved even a modicum of honesty you could say to bar from Obama not a smidgen smoking um honesty she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar\nAnd she knows that she well she still thinks that she has a a political future and it would be a problem for her to\nThe left has gone show all in on this whole me too movement they've made this such a a prominent\nPart of what the left and for now it's the ... movement of the moment right we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different\nA political\n... revolutionary leftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in some time just just wait for it\nBut in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring\nBack on them they don't want to score and their own goals here with me too movement and that the enablers and\nI've always felt that the enablers in this whole process we're getting off far too easy you know the people men and women around someone like Harvey Weinstein and the people men and women around someone like a Les Moonves you know those who were\nNecessary in this whole\nProcess are ... they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and\nHillary was the ultimate in that not only did she stand by her man of course as we know for the most obvious and a self interested political reasons imaginable bushy went on the attack against these women and whenever I hear people say things like don't they have a right to be believed\nI was wondering respond well\nTo the women that Hillary demeaned I mean did the women that were completely attack verbally and the media down to their very character they were all considered to be fighters for the call\nWhat was at the time and there has been no accountability for that whatsoever and there's no accountability to stay for Hillary when when she held accountable for the fact that she was essential in her husband's not just denials but continued book flagrant violations of the\nPublic trust and ... I mean Bill Clinton was accused of rape folks\nRape not just your ... and I really don't like this happens you know this usage of the term sexual assault and sexual harassment being conflated with sexual assault and all of a sudden people are like well you know both sides have their problems you've got Clarence Thomas on one side Bill Clinton on the other no\nClarence Thomas was accused and I don't think particularly credibly accused of saying some inappropriate stuff in the office I mean a worst case basis Clarence Thomas should have been pulled aside by age aren't told hey you know knock that off or there's going to be professional consequences that if he did it I think he did it\nBill Clinton could have spent decades in prison for what he did the allegations against Bill Clinton were up of rape by force and that\nThat's going to send you to prison for very long time in your life is essentially over\nAnd he went on to be the president of the states for eight years so yes Hillary coming out now and saying that she wasn't a part of any this she lies now with such fluidity and so shamelessly I Would tell you all if you if you want to have a a quick and fun read go back and read\nChristopher Hitchens no one left alive [noise] Hitchens was one of these he was a leftist in the nineties and was still a really is a socialist kind of a reform socialist all the way to the very end is clearly an atheist [noise] but he was somebody who just couldn't stomach the lives of the Clintons and the big lives I mean the very obvious\nIn your face self interested lying up the Clintons and he wrote a book called no one left ally do and he just goes through how the Clintons were just lie about stuff [noise]\nMaybe\nDot com friends remember that name visiting new social media sites where you\nCan post you can write you can follow me you can follow each other\nExchange information do whatever you can do on your run of the mill social media site except\n... dot com does not have any of the left wing conversational how nonsense going on okay there's no bias there was no effort to try and do you have a conversation one direction if you are sick of shadow banning if you're sick of things not popping off\nIn your feet on Facebook or wherever you want to try sniffy dot com it's also plays by the way where conservatives can have a real voice and grow their movement and not have to worry about getting crash by the left wing administrators Snoopy dot com that as an I.\nWants to hear that and so they are giving their audience what they want which is that's maybe the biggest part of ... you could argue this either way and the other is that they really believe that this president is so racist and it's such a bad guy is so disreputable on so disgraceful\nThat they find it completely within the realm of of not just possibility but they find it likely that the president noted states would just go off and start praising a Confederate leader as he as they're saying he did in this ah Ohio rally over the weekend\nOr and then it took them two days I mean this was not a trick them two days October twelve the correction posted in October fourteen here's the NBC News correction and earlier tweet missed identified the general President Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio\nIt was general Ulysses Grant not Robert elite and attach to video clip lacked the full context for Trump's remark\nYears the full clip now\nIs where you have to start playing the game probability is it likely that all of these major media corrections could be due to good faith error in covering the president\nOr is it more likely that what we see happening here is a trumped arrangement syndrome as it plays out in the media in front of all of us all the time\nWhich of those things is the more likely scenario I mean I I think you really do have to ask the question and the answer is obvious the press is dare I say on a jihad\nAgainst the president United States they will take any opportunity to try to tear him down\nAnd try to add one more data point into the narrative that he is racist that he's evil that he's a bad guy and this is also compounded by the incentive structure that we have in in the media in general right now\nWhere the initial lie get twenty thousand retreats or you know a hundred thousand ... and then the correction gets two hundred\nAnd so you get the benefit of of all that traffic of all that attention because now in the digital Arab media you really are measuring it down very precisely how many people read this how many people are going to your site and if people saw this you get all the upside and your audience gets what they want\nAnd then if you have to correct it OK well turns out you know that was amiss fire but your audience is never mad at you for bashing from when the correct I mean this audience would be but\nIf you're NBC if you're MSNBC or CNN if you're any of those networks audience doesn't turn on you for that they understand what you're trying to do they know that you have bigger things\nIn mind they know that you have a you know\nOther things that you're trying to do trying to take down the price of the United states that's going to be a difficult thing difficult things to do it and you're gonna you're going to have some Mrs if you're doing that so\nThat's that's just it just the more the media malpractice that we keep seeing and that's why when the president calls them fake news when he says things like you know they they are fake news and they get so upset if they want him to stop calling them fake news maybe they should stop being fake news\nYou know if they would like the president of the states to no longer a push back on them for the obvious partisan smears in their partners in campaigns\nWell then my recommendation to them would be that ah you know we shouldn't\nThey shouldn't act in this way ... you know do you think of them will will apologize when ... loses by ten or eleven points which is going to or do you think any of the pollsters in any of the people that a month ago or something it's going to be a really close race with Pedro and Ted Cruz they're going to come out and say ... I don't think so\nBecause their their activists once you understand that their activists then you realize that there's none of this is even a little bit surprising anymore none of this this is a shock and and then you know then you could at least\nThe anticipate there next week if I were the I\nMean the Leslie stall interview uh was was great because first of all I I find her whole\nHer whole demeanor she's just so serious and so much ... toss missed prostitute I'm doing this very professional interview right I mean you know at a certain point you think yourself can you ask a question like a normal person\nDo you have to do this very affected sixty minutes\nI'm showing depth here oh I'm just going show in depth on the issue\nI mean I loved it when he said Leslie it's okay in the meantime I'm the president and you're not they're not used to this most presidents\nAre certainly all Republican presidents stretching back for my whole lifetime\nUh we're in a position where they felt they had to suck up the meat you maybe you only exception was Reagan but the rest of them felt like they had to suck up to the media or else they're presidency would really suffer because the media had so much power and so much ability to sway public opinion instead Trump is like you know what do you think you're going to push me around is going to push back\nAnd he did he did a fantastic job in that Lesley Stahl interview but they still can't leg loving 'em in the media is coming up with everything they've got the lie about him they do publish fake news they say fake news they do all kinds of things\nYeah and the day the president's just got just got too many skills they can't handle\nIf you've ever found yourself when sing at\nThat week taste of coffee from one of those ... corporate brands you probably thought\nI Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased training bathroom policy reform and things that defy common sense and more time on their coffee that's why you need to start every day with black rifle coffee\nI find black rifle absolutely delicious and not only is a fantastic coffee I liked that I'm supporting a company founded by veterans of special operations community guys who loves country love what they do for their fellow veterans and are all about delicious small batch roast or coffee\nEverybody listen to this should make black rifle coffee their coffee brand no reason not to folks got a black rifle coffee dot com slash book received Fifteen Percent off your order black rifle coffee dot com slash blockbuster use that code black rifle coffee dot com slash book\n[noise]\n\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud with retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nIt will be ... a lauded as heroes on the left we will be considering we the Senate Democrats you know I Am Spartacus Cory Booker and Feinstein and the rest of the\nSwamp dwelling swamp creatures they would all be viewed as going to the mat for righteous cause they would all be viewed as having done the right thing even if they hadn't come out of course in the end and\nNow we see is well yeah sure the left is excited about this but the left wing base already hated Kavanaugh they already hated Trump they already were going to do anything that they could to vote for Democrats\nWhat they didn't anticipate was that normal Americans yes dare I say even some undecided independents saw the way the Democrats were acting in that whole process and they came away from it thinking\nI don't think we should have hand over power to crazy I don't think we should hand over power to crazy I don't think that makes sense it's a bad idea and if you're not going to hand over power crazy that means you got to keep the the Republicans in charge\nA that means that all of the media is efforts to create this Russia collusion narrative and all these other stories about Trump and the twenty twenty Fifth Amendment in all of that will have been for not\nAnd we'll have been for naught because instead of just understanding that it was a do or die political issue for the Republicans Republicans do not cave when it came to Capitol\nOr they thought if they were willing to take the gloves off and agree to take the gloves off and do anything they would of course come out the victors and yet that was the that was the assumption that uh they were making and it was a very bad assumption as we see now\nBut I just think it's interesting they are you at it and MSNBC host thinks you know wow it's like you mean like there people are like upset about the Kavanaugh thing and I think the Democrats but of course what they want to say Democrats weren't effective\nWhich is really a almost a version of well you know communism is just not implemented well enough right it's not the with the Democrats\nDid with Kavanaugh was on its face in its essence at its foundation a complete in a completely immoral disgraced it was but that's not what they were taking away from this but they're taking away as oh I guess Democrats didn't play there and play their hand well enough\nI guess maybe they didn't you know strategize this thoroughly enough force cheesy\nAs Bush would've said search injury and decider are great words that are that Bush gave us\nA so I I Would note that this is this is a very real sentiment folks ... houses and play Santa's going to be Republican were good to go where you and I are going to be high fiving on November sex when the Senate results come in the Senate good to go so we're clear which also means that the president is in no danger whatsoever\nOf being removed I mean not that he really was anyway but\nYou know and you have a Republican majority never mind getting two thirds you wanna get fifty one to get the president out um but on the house side of things we have been led to believe all along\nThat there was a ... almost no chance the Republicans would keep the house now we see hold on a second not only is the overstating the case thing true when it comes to ... the Irish men pretending to be a Hispanic guy\nAnd they may have overstated their advantage and their case when it comes to a whole lot of other stuff like the entire house of representatives [noise]\n\n\n\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nShows like this evening lose ... mid forties for Tuesday's Sony with high low or fifties Tuesday mostly ... around forty degrees from Wednesday mostly sunny with how is the mid fifties you can get your forecast anytime a double UTA gee dot com key word whether a jeep [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bucks back then is that\nMaybe I'm particularly attuned to this right now because of the madness that we have seen just just today a with regard to this Elizabeth Warren DNA fiasco this this self\nInflicted wound that uh that Elizabeth Warren now has and and it reminds me though that that's the left\nReally is increasingly a just just\nLosing its mind I mean there's nothing that you can really\nSay any more of that is an extension of their previous beliefs there's there's nothing that you can really say\nAnd think well there's no way they'd ever make that you know ... ... if I'm trying to make a point about the extremes of what they believe in what they think they wouldn't go that far well it it turns out that we're running out\nOf areas where that is still true it it turns out that there are very few things that we can point to and say oh they would never\nThey would never allow that thing to happen anymore because those examples that we used to use are increasingly now the reality on the left right so this is that this is the perfect example\nYou have the daily call here with a piece that a biological male\nWho identifies or they transgender woman\nWon a woman's world championships likely event on Sunday you know Rachel McKinnon a professor at the College of Charleston won the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine age bracket at the twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championship in Los Angeles\nSo we have somebody who is the first transgender woman world champion\nAnd we're supposed to celebrate this do they really expect us to celebrate this\nThis is supposed to be treated like it is in some way a victory a victory for whom I victory for transgender rights certainly not a victory for women the reason that we have sex segregated sports is not because of sexism and maybe this is where progressive\nJust can't follow the logic training or maybe they just are unable to understand this but the reason we have sex segregated sports is because men are overwhelmingly and invariably biologically larger heavier stronger and faster\nThan women as a function of hormones and genetics that's just that's the truth I mean I I used to occasionally with some friends of mine a scrimmage with some of the women's varsity teams when I was in college and then I could tell you that I a reasonably athletic\nCollege male would probably be a three sport superstar for most female programs if he had had some of the of the same skills by playing let's say on a high school team I mean that that's just the truth\nBut that's why we have sex segregated sports but the leftist show devoted to this idea of transgender rights entrenched and to raise them as something that must be celebrated river I've told you the the way that the progressive\nApproach these issues is it starts with just just tolerant be tolerant and then it's you know be inclusive and then it's\nCelebrated and then it's you know\n... or accept this or else which is basically a version of celebrate it but they they always have this sliding scale and it will start just with oh just tolerate it that's the first thing\nAnd and then you have to you know later you off from it and then it'll be told the celebrated that's I skipped affirmed to celebrate their before but here we have it I mean if I told you five years ago that we would see pieces about how men could compete in female sporting events because they say they're transgender", "year": "2018",
