do\nSeriously I remember that but I remember that big time\nTo go to the last time I went trick or treating yeah I was a wrestler and at the time there was a wrestler who literally just for a white T shirt and a a sweater vest\nWho is that a lot ah I don't know they were like uh they were like a tag team the duo from they're supposed to be like a preppy prep each part of shame a man's posse\n... so I I wore a sweater vest and a white T shirt was like get trick or treat give me I remember ... ... ... was the much to me because that took time and effort and Downey and makeup and all those other a lot of cocaine and steroids\nRight you underwrite I gave you only have a right let's go to Dennis most er about Halloween good morning Dennis\nAnd are you I'm good how are you\nBut I just I think three day you but it shows that are very clear in my mind one is the outer limit oh wait a minute [laughter] oh no no no hold on\nA rover listen\nThere's nothing wrong with your income you're right [noise] [noise]\nIf we we we will bring up about\nIf we [noise]\nWe [noise] we will control\nCan\nWe can change\nA while and then we will control home to see him [noise] maybe there is nothing wrong with your TV [noise] more about the rate than\nYou are about to experience the fall and mystery which reaches from the mine too [noise] the [noise]\nI used to scare the heck out of me the ... will start yeah I saw the re runs of that crap you pull that off so quickly\nBono I haven't been on my ... year with all my other Halloween stuff\nOkay so if one more that the teachers\nFantastic creatures\nNo fantastic teachers teachers with an F.\nThen there's also what I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all [noise]\nYeah I Know is not running anymore but you'd think that for all the time it's been a concern circles and here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again neither am I but I seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan\nA but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is a very clear political and yes part is an issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play it\nYou cannot in Tucson ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... and following the plain text of the constitution I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously out only agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\nA\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a foreign ... if a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction is he really subjective I mean you know this is where he started to get it okay well hold on a second\nAnd and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay more American taxes would you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French stroll French French joy on French soil or I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen\nI sew jurisdiction is not just about geography\nAnd that's where this gets more that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen right in the case of\nThe sons of a insult us diplomats who were born here they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship so that's\nA place where there's no clarity it off in the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs and has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long\nAnd for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ...\nTo the geo piece side I got to say I was I was pleased that at least at least Trump was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are here you go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on all the new majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about\nNew Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul right look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay\nIn maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels whatever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not with Walter but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party dare I say and and that brings it back to how I don't accept this\nSeparation of party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party it's eight other bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe\nDonnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the U.S senator other Joe Donnelly\nHere's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side\nAnd on the Senate side are state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nIs this guy said I\nCould you imagine if a Republican said that I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right well gosh cruiser my cigarette break\nUp a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're oh you're oh you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't sound like much of a government does it bread banks I think\nI mean brand and you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like her\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get this is this is the Democrats the best and brightest both the Democrat Party senator\nJoe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up at the Republican did it that would probably be the end\n[noise]\n\nWith all the recent

saying that is ridiculous I I Can't even keep a straight face as I'm saying to you when the when the Democrats if the Democrats heaven forbid bug bite your tongue if the Democrats take a majority in the house of representatives\nThey are going to go scorched earth against this president because that is the only prayer that the left thinks they have to get the presidency back\nIn twenty twenty it's going to be a two prong election struggle right it's going to be one defame destroyed Trump in every way you can with whatever you can and to replay\nThe twenty sixteen election redo the twenty sixteen election go back\nA third term of of Obama that's the only thing that left really has up their sleeve here are those are the ways that you're going to see this play out and I I just think it's all part of the PLO see that's the classic Democrat reaching you see it as long as Democrats in red states too\nYou know that's what you have Democrats who say oh yeah I'm a I like gun rights oh yeah you know I\nI'm a you know not not\nFor all all of the uh you know on a roll pro Choice America ...\n... slaughter of the unborn I mean you know there there are some Democrats will play this game of them the moderate blue dog Democrat and a gun toting Democrat and all this stuff\nBut they are today they disappoint because they're really it's a much more left wing party than they're willing to say say openly and honestly the Democrats are now led by\nPeople on the left I mean when I say let it all just me and her leadership in elected office I just mean the ideology of the modern Democratic Party has gone much further to the left then people are in the Democratic party are are willing to be honest about 'em and that's why I think we have such a\nSo much just\nNot disagreement at this point but it's like we see the world and he's completely different terms what's because\nFrom dealing with a bunch of clause economies who don't pay any attention to history and think capitalism is bad I think that the government's always good the bigger the government the better and you know white males or an oppressive terrible force in the world the need to be brought to heal if that's who I'm dealing with it's really tough to be like yeah let's find a middle ground so just remember\nPollution and the Democrats lie about being moderate and unfortunately Republicans lie about being conservative [noise] that's\nThe way the way [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise]\nSo we have more in that position in the first places because Democrats have failed to come to the table that failed to work with this president and pass legislation that helps protect our country that helps protect the citizens of America\nBecause they did not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order a country that the reason that we're in this predicament if the Democrats in Congress has failed to do their jobs and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find\nA legally unconstitutionally that to make sure that we're doing everything we can\nListen in a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seem to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax on the rafters tend to go the other way in court to view clauses misses having meaning they don't just this past them you can make a disease can certainly make a good faith arguments and it limits birth racism birthright citizenship\nYeah you can viewpoints you first\nOf all that Sarah Huckabee Sanders I'm with her or the Democrats they can't have it both ways that can't be the law's the law and then be well but we're not going to do in jury enforce ban and let's not being mean and what's not separate families and all the rest of it right you can have if you go both ways and they went out to both ways with immigration all the time\nThey want to say they want a strong for her but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border they say they want an orderly immigration system bought that I Want to do interior enforcement is that there should be consequences roiling the law but they don't want to know when they get prosecuted ... at home or anything else\nRight so yeah this is classic and then with the constitutional aspect you would have to say\nThe only thing that amuses me more than media lives discovering the constitution is what media lips discover the Bible\nYou know and you know that's when all of a sudden you hear Corinthians to to [laughter] you're like wait what\nWhat are they talking about\nUh so I I Love the I Love the\nFor songs I'm going to read you now from the book of poems\nThey say in the media uh yeah so this is where you see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that they're they're trying to Institute here\nBecause they're ... they're very literally just in a interpretation\nOf this clause let's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where liberals\nOr do the right to bear arms you\nCould have ... million in Brussels that's why we said arms yes\nAt the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was ... but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then we're arms are now ah and that's why the press the press has any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press\nAnd the jurisdiction narrow okay well what does that exactly\nMean what does that mean based upon the understanding at the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment remedies that the Obama administration um\nFirst of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and\nHere's a here's a great example um of of that you have Harry Reid okay this is even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently didn't know what he had to say about illegal aliens play quibbling\nKept making any money to be an illegal alien is now\nOffering a reward for being linked\nYou know same country went to the\nIf you break our law\nWith US citizenship\nThat's right we do\nThis was like okay you know if if I Rob a bank I'll get in trouble but my kid who didn't do anything wrong you know my my baby when he grows up she gets the trust fund I made with the money from robbing the bank\nDishes ill gotten gains they could try to think of it any other way they want they try to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth and Internet now you have this debate over the fourteenth the habit of the fourteenth amendment let's just get right to it right now uh it's all about\nMaking sure that after the civil war is written in sixty six after the civil war\nThere was no question as a matter of law that African Americans would be granted or or had would even be granted we had\nA full citizenship and all the rights and protections that that\nThose who

these individuals in the caravan forcing them out walking they have helped us uh in New ways to slow this down to write this up and keep it from moving as aggressively towards the United states\nTruth is these caravans though are being driven by leftist organizations in Central America [noise]\nThey are by human traffickers who you need to know have no regard for human life\nYou know we're the more information we're getting\nOn all of this the more information we have on this caravan more obvious it becomes that ah yeah that's right there are people behind this\nThere are people who are involved in organizing and funding and and pushing this whole thing forward a literally and figuratively 'em and you know what\nAm I been saying all along that there's this talking points\nAre there are thousands of miles away and now they're dying hundred and Ninety nine miles away you know\nThis was ridiculous because\nWhat we're already seeing now is according to NBC News an hour ago\nOh that's right now that they've assembled and gotten all this attention they're not planning on walking the whole way they've advanced two hundred and fifty miles into Mexico and you have them asking quote for buses\nWeary Margaret caravan residents of Mexico asks for buses that's right\nYou got about four thousand four thousand people saying that you know they want buses and organizers\nOh that's right it's not an organized event my friends but they are organized or somehow they got organizers who are uh are trying to get all these buses to materialize and get this whole thing going\nAnd we're supposed to believe that there's that this is just all spontaneous this just came together because there's really there's really nothing in it beyond that there's only two of beyond that\nIs just nuts it's just nuts and there's such nastiness out\nThere right now about Trump's sending more troops to the border again they're saying oh it's political theater it's political theater\nWell and in the military is not going to engage in a military sense or the military just as they would use you know when we send National Guard or when we when we have military that assist\nIn a natural disaster zone no one stupid enough to suit or what what they're going to do ... new houses that have been blown down like know\nObviously our military is there to help to assist in whatever way they can because the interests of the nation and and it's people or the interest of the United states military\nAnd ... this is the commander in chief taken it upon himself to try and a sister border patrol and it's also a show of seriousness\nIt's also meant to say hey you know whatever we can do we will do and we want border patrol to feel like they have the full backing in support of the federal government which by the way it not only do they not have under the Obama administration did not have one of the Bush administration\nThe Bush is are bad on the border you heard it here if you've never heard of before you probably heard me say it though but the bushes were battling border issues I mean George W was he was he was really a McCain conservative in many ways I mean he was a squishy\nOn on some of these very weak on border issues and an immigration issues but we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know how the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism going on\nUm but I I think that the president is from a purely political perspective\nMaking the right choice is here to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between\nThe Democrats and Republicans and Democrats don't want to they want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be enforced they don't want a system that privileges\nOf those who will bring special skills and be a more easily able to contribute to the economy in a net positive what they don't want any of that they want as many unskilled\nA limited education non English speaking workers\nAs possible or even non workers but what's going on over there was maybe it was possible as quickly as possible because this is how the left as it gets crazier and crazier and more and more socialist thinks that they can turn America into a one party state\nA one party ... a democratic socialist state run by the Democratic party immigration is is central to that plan do not forget it\n[noise] there's a revolt that has been brewing for some time among conservatives because we understand that social media giants out there have they left word too and we're sick of it we don't want our conversations to be clipped to be steered in other directions or just to be entirely shutdown\nThat's why there are places to go now where you could actually share your thoughts and ideas\nWithout worrying about bias and all this other nonsense coming into the equation no agenda know hidden tools that sniffy dot com ... dot com it's a new social media sites where you can post engage with others share your thoughts\nAnd just have the conversation role naturally you don't have to worry about them using your information ways you don't like you don't have to worry about them

I was a media and their maniacs can support and you know anyone in anything\nAnd I mean we hear very little about the family Research Council shooter for example but he was all about you know the MSNBC talking points and and wanted to wanted to kill people who were\nPro life and I'm pro traditional family or you know how a lot of you're probably the clock when even talking about if you go and do a you know do a quick Google Search on that you'll be like wow this guy was a left wing terrorist\nBut no one ever refers to them that way he was that's what he was he was he left for any and he actually ...\nSo it wasn't it wasn't just an attempted something or it wasn't just sending in threats he actually took the talent the Bernie Sanders shooter who didn't try to show up at a baseball field but got caught on my way or something got there in shock people and almost killed them very nearly killed the ... so\nBut Stewart understands this this dynamic and now now look I Am a big\nCritic of the whole John Stewart clown nose on clown nose off thing it's like you know like ... like I'm Down to it I'm all funny honk honk and then oh well now let me lecture you all on the constitution and my Christiana mom poor impression voice it's like no\nIf you want to engage in political issues you have to be willing to and you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have\nI just have fake puppets going into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest and Stuart's done lots of that you know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha\nAnd that was what he did I mean he really just took what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you read the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there is reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this but the live idea always\nComes out on top and that's the ... with those outlets do to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is\nIs winning but the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your ideas they said this is just reality this\nIs just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example launder Z liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe in the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead of liars they're liars tapper liar\nBlitzer liar I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis Cooper all all of them I mean Don Lemon and like all other that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about this George right about the narcissism point and it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think the steward has come upon some bit of brilliance here yeah the ... is what the narcissism is what the\nTrump taps into of because look he understands\nPeople with big egos Trump is a very very big ego we I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that\nBecause even if something else is kind of like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believed could happen\nSo I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have a bit of a you know you gotta earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember and then\nYou know be humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a for drop but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing that they can come up with\nAs an answer because it's so once you

amber Avi is with us she is a a writer at the Daily Caller she's the media and breaking news editor ever are going to have you on the show\nThank you so much for having me\nAll right let's first talk 'cause I I Know you spoke at American University so you went into the campus gauntlet recently and had to deal with all all that craziness and there was even a little bit of backlash after you spoke about before we get to that just something a little bit about some of the\nThe hateful rhetoric that used against Trump in your piece definitely\nSo I decided to take a look into this because the media has of course\nAnd blaming Trump's rhetoric for the recent on scores of hate crimes including the hype on such a democratic official and then on the anti Semitic attack on synagogue in Pittsburgh and I thought to myself I've been covering the media for about a year and a half now\nAnd I can let things off the top of my head that they've set about Trump better just hateful and\nIn some cases even violent so on this list you'll find things like uh Nicole walls that MSNB he's saying that he wants you're wearing White House press secretary air enters its neck\nYou how to an end gas a jet yesterday\nSaying that he believes Trump has I'm radicalized more people than ISIS which is a literal terror group that has a hundred thousand numbers uh and just the list goes on and on Rick Wilson threatened to got a panelist on CNN like a fish\nSo my belief in the knee as if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric for insight that they need to take a look in the near and think about the things that you're saying is well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon tubes scene in the last couple of weeks and I we've been talking about it a lot on the show\nThat there's a there's kind of a brain hum dealing when it comes to media that you know they basically just saying the conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat exactly right they they I don't want and I think was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side I'm On Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people\nAnd then immediately demonize people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in the country in the literal St brat\nSo these people they talk about respecting the other side and rafting down its course and being respectful but they're often the worst offenders\nNow tell me about your foray into a into a campus speech here in the swamp area recently it got quite a bit of bugs\nYeah it got pretty sloppy so I spoke at American University and I was talking about due process on specifically in the air as neat you and of course the Kavanaugh hearing that took place several weeks ago\nWhere he was accused of
