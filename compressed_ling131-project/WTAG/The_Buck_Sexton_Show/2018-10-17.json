I think really good tips here it's going to be lost like shirts secure and make sure that data on a secure same trick for your laptop\nYeah make sure that it's that way All right Craig that was very very helpful very very helpful so so if you want to get this kind of stuff\nAnd you want more and you don't want to be bothered and be tried to to be sold something or you don't want to worry about getting act is very simple all the you do is taxed mine named to this number\nEight five five three eight five fifty five fifty three but eight five five three eight five fifty five fifty three\nThat's right standard data and tax rates will apply but you're going to love all of the information that you get crank that was great segment with you really appreciate it will talk to you next week\nThey thanks Jim by by\nYou deserve a better way to watch the sports you love ESPN wants to live for and onto the show for\nWith the original and the entire thirty percent\nAnd he's doing whatever he can to get that done and that's his legacy as a conservative you know ... you know he said what you will about\nMitch and the swamp and all that stuff he has\nBeen a warrior for conservative judges getting on the bench\nGetting the highest courts as we know with cabin on elsewhere that's at stake here if the Democrats were to take control the Senate you could say goodbye to getting any good judges through\nIf the Democrats take control the Senate it's going to be a complete stoppage on federal judges in less you put forward America Garland type and anyone who you think might be kind of a centrist according to the way the media describes him trust me that judges are leftist\nSo you might get somebody like America Arlen do come through and uh\nBut overall they'll they'll bring it to a screeching halt so so at ... at some level there's there's a judge\nIssue at stake here or judges are at stake with the midterms I think we're good on that in the Senate side but then you go to the house side of the equation you realize that\nWe will be subjected to ... a\nStoppage of Trump's most important policy agenda items if the Democrats take the house it will be over\nYou know maybe they'll play a little poodle foot\nSea with our side when it comes to an infrastructure bill\nBut it it's over in terms of getting a wall immigration reform well that that's\nNot going to happen and we're going to be in a two year long grinding battle where all the media is going to want to\nDo is try to exact revenge on Trump and all of his supporters for the humiliation that they've and your at the media's in Georgia for the last couple of years you'll be treated you the most politicized and nonsensical investigations imaginable\nAnd you will see sure enough that yeah they're going to make this about about impeachment even if they know they can't remove the president they want to impeach him just to put a stain on his presidency that they can then you should try to run someone at twenty twenty now the good news for us\nIs that the Democrats so far have nobody\nRealistic that they can run against Trump twenty twenty I mean it's this list that that I saw earlier this week than CNN had the polling on on who could be who could be up again strawberry you at at the top list Joe\nBiden come on guys by didn't that the best you can do\nBelow by new had boring I don't think she's exactly going to be a threat I don't think I don't think Warren's got it\nOr you had some other names on there you know ... Kamala Harris why cause she checks them boxes that the left likes not nothing that you've ever seen her do legislatively or otherwise I was impressive\nAnd I've I've heard from people that it was someone on her staff I don't know this but the rumor that and I'm reporting on a rumor I Know you can yell at me later rumor was that was somewhat on her staff not Feinstein staff that actually that information I don't have proof of that I'm not naming anybody obviously because I don't have proof of it but that was what I heard and that wouldn't surprise me\nWe have that other staffer a ... a congressional staffer who was leaking the personal information of Republican senators a dachshund them straight abducted he's facing real time in prison he should go\nBut I I Hope the GOP has had a wakeup call here and that's really what I'm folks and I hope that\nRepublicans that every person who voted for Trump understands that all the good things that are happening\nCome to effectively come

later\n[noise] so I I like everything with Lindsey Graham who say they're still the very end I don't uh I like he he was\nHe didn't meet it the way that it's out it I could say that I he just misspoke a you know he didn't mean that he\nJust met her Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact Iranians up and many Iranian friends throughout my life and ah it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms of the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole ... running chair anyway\nI Love the other stuff you were saying about I was going to take a DNA test every Lindsey Graham is he's very much a very much a man struck by a kind of knew swagger\nBecause I I think that he really understands\nUh he he really understands that you got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean Lindsey in a sense kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months\nYou know what as much as as much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to this show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they are willing to\nUh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them we got to crush the ideas I don't crush people but I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as a kid say we might have to own the lives a little bit\nUh so what does your grandma I liked that he's been ... is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also\nThink that you know on on immigration he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more a hard\nLine on this stuff ... here's what he said click with eight\nEleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning poor countries what do we do with them I Want a merit based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans\nAnd together ... control who gets the job for legal immigration moved to merit based immigration you can ignore the eleven men they'll never be a deal right with the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven million her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think he gets around this when you have folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little a little too squishy on the issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University ... nerds for backing me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is not a loving it is twenty million at a minimum\nWhich is a vast number of people\nFrom a a generally speaking from one country from Mexico I mean that the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically where there was an enormous border\nAnd you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really doesn't know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you\nThat when you have a population that has a that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that Porter we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over the border\nAnd then you have a population that maintains a tremendous and kitchen and tremendously powerful and continuing ties to the the what's considered the homeland of the mother country\nA ... you have a a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically minimum de stabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is\nA you know what he needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is might look I give him a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as\nI'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're going to get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security well see what happens with this request for a wall and that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo eat unless you're talking a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean excuse me five being in the Senate has been a half\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that six hundred and Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go\nTrump's going to win in court he can repeal talk of the day he was in court what do we do with these young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for ...\nFor funding for DACA that ...\nThat are I think I think you could sell that to the republic ... if it was for fun you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still or it's not a\nA but it can't be it can be citizenship and it can't be permanent just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the nine eleven but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years and if you by the way I understand that the\nPolitical sway that the Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border a ... that will skew the entire debate and discussion going forward\nAnd all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a you know a an afterthought\nThey will they will be able to turn America into a one party state that's the game the Democrats are flying Republicans keep thinking about this like well you know maybe we can deal with some of the Democrats are looking at the immigration issue is how do we make the

I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote that description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty\nToward toward the president [noise] so I'm you know I I had thought that the president this is before he was the president I thought that maybe he and I hadn't strayed from his Myrtle vowed here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action\nIn their lives um bad especially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrats but there is also\nPart of the things well you know maybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the present referring to a woman as horse face\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week and this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say but that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know he is and it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo ... that's a part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect\nWhich we all know he is a and I think that we should be able to have that chalk are among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still be want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's\nYeah that's a little that's a little bit beneath where where our presidents or B that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect it's pretty darn good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's\nI I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know it's not perfect who's pretty darn good it really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nI looked at me Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I said let me tell you why I say that instead of just saving and I let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why I give Trump a lot of leeway why I cut this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe we're just going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked all the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was as a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year you making plenty of money she's got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that\nFalse miss all that fall so that she's out they're peddling to people would really go on challenged in a meaningful way and the worst of all if she were to win the presidency against a Romney like figure you when I when I have a harder time putting food on the table paying our mortgages or in my case rent you\nKnow paying bills taking care of family taking care of medical bills would all be harder because of Elizabeth Warren because she has wrong ideas because she's self involves because she doesn't\nUnderstand the way the world really works and because she's benefited from this system\nThe system in place that the left holds up at all costs of some people you know get a get special privileges some people will get pushed through now and and others are told well you have some form of privilege so you have to just suffer in silence I'm Sorry\nAt Trump has saved us from yet another progressive destruction machine this case would've been Elizabeth Warren's while I'm laughing about the whole thing he's also don't the nation a great service by making sure that Elizabeth Warren focus hunters does not become president\n[noise]\nOh there's been a bipartisan ... good taco entitlement changes because of what popularity of low show programs hopefully some Puerto Rico or go sure is about the ... you\nWere from a car or walk of regrets re look I say it would love is Mitch Mitch is Abbas Mich got it done Mitch held the line for Kavanaugh there are some people now that are you know I Will always have a soft spot for a and because of that Kavanaugh fight which was one of the nastiest\nPolitical fights of my lifetime okay and Mitch McConnell God Bless man when it counted you were there when a counter shield was high or you know I\nThere was all the Lindsey Graham I wasn't a use Lindsey fan in the past but first of all Lindsey Graham's Gallo saucy lately too he's really letting the less habit\nI like Lindsey unleash you know he's doing his thing but another one who's in that category and and I take a much\nMuch softer tone on Jeff Flake too he he could have been ... himself to the ah MSNBC crowd but instead he did the right thing and then he made a mistake he could have caused us the whole thing so I'm not saying he's not the same category as McConnell and John Graham for the special\nSpecial folks were the anyway I just wanted to say\nUh the deficit is the highest it's been six years books\nAnd I came into this business of conservative media\nRight at the height of the Tea Party's power in this country and she party as a movement\nAnd I went to work for Glenn Beck and Glenn was very tied in with the Tea Party and you know I I saw this this wave of a just a restoration of concern\nOr the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many\nUm so many things all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right and and also restoration of the American founding as as a topic of conversation I I'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress I'm Sorry what was the Senate\nAnd White House now for almost two years and we haven't taken action\nAnd I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is June going to become one of these issues where are we all talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this but at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that\nWe got to spend less Republicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fun but the truth is we've got to spend less and that means we gotta spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel like they paid in and so it's not an entitlement at the government\nYeah making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security that's pretty much true we just you change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and your great grandkids\nAre going to be paying the financial price for the care that people take it out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational fast and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collected record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so you know we're always told oh there's not enough there's not enough ah revenues there's not revenue which there's too much ... more than a revenue there's too much spending\nGovernment has got to rein it in and in less where you know we're either going to have a\nSerious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth [noise]\nSo I I'm a I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters but I I won't hormone or too much talked to Ron Paul but it's a little bit that was interesting Easter was a big lead ... [noise] and we'll be right back\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nThis evening lose will be around forty degrees from Wednesday Sony in the morning and probably starting in the afternoon hides me up or fifties Wednesday night mostly clear those dropping to the lowest thirties every Thursday sunny much cooler with high in the lower ... you can get your forecast anytime a WTO ... dot com keyword whether [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex is back\nWhat am I got a cloud Mm she's very aware of what's going on and Atlantic got her ... fell a different kinds of conversations hadn't my daughter and my twelve year old and an active ... active and she ... she ... her little girl her age ...\nThat she wasn't at ... am I dial it down [laughter]\nYeah you know at a you know she came home and cry when I went oh wow this is a is specifically liberal\nProblem and and I I\nI never liked to be mean or even to silly lips and I don't like to marketing with family and I certainly would never mock a twelve year old girl or twelve year old boy twelve year old anybody\nUm that's not cool that's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old as somebody with strong opinions and who goes home from school and cries about them that's that's not of any interest to me whatsoever would ism interest to me is that that was a clip\nOf Maggie Gyllenhaal all the actress on the view and she seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an act of asked\nKids should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child\nWould feel the need to come home and cry\nBecause that young girl met another girl who did not self described as a feminist is because the parents are engaging in a really relentless\nPropaganda campaign toward their own children now parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that\nI think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by ... really instilling in um a radical leftist belief\nAnd not letting them keep an open minded and develop their their own beliefs but I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues that they have no ability", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Worcester", "day": "17"}
