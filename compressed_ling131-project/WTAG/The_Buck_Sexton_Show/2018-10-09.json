four hour notice harm so we're we have no idea and hit the audacity my daughter my mother the mother of the bride I got a text message through to the owner of the company had a Clinton girl that I Am\n[laughter] I'm In fact have you know you're going to go to help her that the\nRight people to pick up and tell them that you're right back to her only God in a moral obligation\nOr when you're you know I used to be a DJ way back when and I used to do weddings and I hated doing weddings because you know what I'm doing a company office party or retirement party just any party\nSo it's a party when you do in a way you make one single mistake and one's wedding day like they say every wedding has the story don't ... don't be the story\nAnd that's why I go out of my way or\nThe ... to the wedding you know I Am when I ... yeah I mean\nWe're going to have it on our office now or ... or I Want to hear about a million dollars was wedding which is right down the middle\nDid it really matter that Lindsey Graham\nJumped him when he did the answers abs so ... is ... ... and also this this storyline is pathetic more ironic story line about how Kavanaugh was ... and his response and so he's not he's not judge like\nEven though he's been a judge for like over a decade and the D.C court of appeals he wasn't being a judge when he was in front of the Senate he was being accused of of being a a predator\nAnd he was on the defense stand okay he was being treated like a a criminal even though it's a non criminal proceeding he wasn't being a judge you would be treated like a criminal\nThe reason they were so upset though and that they would switch that narrative is that they thought they had him on the ropes they thought they were going to finish them off and Lindsey Graham along with Kavanaugh rallied but this was close and I think that that gets lost and all this and it also was\nNot without consequences I had the opportunity to speak to our buddy to ...\nOn rising and that interview will be appearing tomorrow morning if you want to see it you go to heal the TV but I was able to speak about this little bit and he made some important points I'm One that it's\nNot like there are not consequences for cabin all that came from this Harvard said that he's no longer allowed to teach because they they will once again at the academy they caved to the leftist mob dishes how they do things their place Thirteen\nTime particularly outraged at my colleagues and students at Harvard law school\nThose of them who have made it impossible for Kavanaugh to continue to teach their it's rampant McCarthyism at its worst reminiscent of what I experienced what I was a student at Brooklyn College in the fifties where professors were fired\nBecause it was suspected that they went Seventeen or Twenty years old they might have been a members or fellow travelers are the Communist Party which you have to put an end to that\nThat's right this has to stop\nGoes ditches corrosive to politics this degrades and your roads political discourse and as for the for the last two have ever been the ones trying to shame conservatives over Trump and his and his erasing of norms ... the hypocrisy here is insane factors also spoke about that\nSpecifically about how how one of the primary things you see going on here with the way the left try to take down capital just how hypocritical thing it's way twelve\nTo ... run rampant the constitution would not permit\nImpeachment of sitting justice for actions he took while a private citizen thirty five years ago a nor I think what it for ... using the laws of perjury which are very tough to have to be about a material facts that has to have been a deliberate life not forgetful is not a motion not an exaggeration\nBut a willful deliberate lie about a material facts\nI think that the Democrats are shooting themselves as a foot we ought to be moving forward let's judge justice Kevin off on his um performance as a justice of the Supreme Court\nThat's right\nLet's actually ... Jersey which doesn't even like Kavanaugh the judge theirs was disagrees with his jurisprudence disagrees with a he disagrees with McConnell who\nBy the way is like a boss\nGotta give credit where it's due McConnell gets too big high fives ... there was disagrees with holding the Senate or are they holding the Americans set out to be the Merrick Garland seat open\nWhich I Would not want to Gorsuch is not this isn't even this isn't even the Garland see but people still talk about that like they're keeping some kind of a scoreboard tally\nYou want to keep a scoreboard you don't you got to keep in mind the only reason Republicans were able to get through the justice is they they do right now is because Harry Reid figured hey I'll I'll Obama's going to be president forever man so let's just pack the court with left wing activists pretending to be judges and let's get rid of the filibuster\nWell Harry Reid started that battle started that fight Republicans now set to finish it at least for the time being\nA but this is this is where you see that the\nDamage that has been done to I I think too that the whole Senate confirmation process I think they should just get rid of it I mean they should do it but it should be a very pro forma\nYou know okay this guy presents no witnesses nor grandstanding for the senators no more asking questions that are really just disguise speeches not returning to okay this is the\nThis justice gets to make a statement and then the Senate votes that's it that's advising they know is background they know his or her background and case a case as they've been involved and that's it\nNo 'cause otherwise you just open up to this and we're going to using this character assassination ever was bad\nJust wait until Ruth Bader Ginsburg is no longer the Supreme Court and they try to replace her with Amy Coney Barrett liberal heads will exclude\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase more simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk\nYour being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile or Internet provider not only can they record you're browsing history they often sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information that's why I decided to take my privacy back by using express VPN\nExpressed VPN has easy use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phone and tablet turning on expressed VPN protection takes only one click you can protect yourself and express UPN at less than seven dollars a month\nTo have you ever used public why fight and you want to keep hackers and spy some senior stuff expressed VPN is the solution protect your online activity today and find out how you can get three months free and express V.

here's my theory on this because I spoke to president about this week's ago during that interview I've told you all about a bunch I I think that they're holding this for another week or two 'cause they know that when people see it when they finally see and this is look they're holding the truth and they're well within\nTheir rights to do it ... and they're also doing what the other side as

written about this just today there were doctors are clearly CYA\nOr see why be put it that way for cover your but\nThere were ... to the information we have from Des OJ an FBI about the Russia collusion investigation are meant to protect the bureaucratic but\nOf those involved that's what's been redacted so far and there's no reason that I can see to continue to withhold this stuff unless they they're I think there's just a desperation on the left\nTo keep it out of the public light as long as possible that they don't know they don't have a better alternative than just delayed delayed the legs look we'll look at a drive with capital even if they had to lake out of the chances are of the dumps\nTaking the Senate were pretty slim no matter what but their main game was delayed delayed delay just try to wait for better times you know you never know what can happen you never know that was the idea\nOnce it's information comes out and we see the ... off two main conclusions from it defies information and I'd like to see the full\nScope of the ... thinking about that we have not being told we the American people has not been told what has gone into the smaller probe in terms of what was authorized for investigation we've gotten a a version of it but not the full version the full version of it still classified\nIn fact so classified that when Mueller's team went in front of a federal judge I Believe was Emmett Sullivan they initially tried to hold information back from the federal judge like we can't tell you that he said I'm cleared for whatever you're going to tell me that so we have so much we don't know when we finally get that information what\nWill see is that this\nWas that the rejection they've been lying to us which will even further damage the credibility of the FBI the deejay as non political organizations they were very politicized ... it's a legacy of the Obama administration would Eric Holder for heaven sakes running to the OJ legacy of the Obama administration\nThat this kind of behavior um went all the way that it did you know it's not surprising at all when you look at it in that context\nOr we're going to find that it's highly that was all about covering up for for their mistakes and and for the politicization and that's why the hell and then you're also going to see that there was a they manufacture the pretext for this investigation to which I think will be the single most damaging thing once we have that in plain language in black and white in front of her since\nYou're beautiful [noise] ah I really hope the American people hold

I think ... hey maybe I'm an Indian\nIsn't it ridiculous books I mean the left\nWants to lecture us about Trump and his decorum and his tweets and I'm hearing more and more for my swamp sources that there to plan really is\nAs much as I'm hoping it's Hillary may kill him as much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be Warren for twenty twenty\nMaybe Warren and then a a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career we're not for racial fraud racial fraud you know if you lie about the assets\nYou have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that you\nGet an awful lot of trouble if you lie about your race in order to get into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university really at Harvard\nOr Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to excuse the whole thing I mean it it should it seem it's embarrassing and there's a ... Warren has here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things\nBut here's what I won't let go she has never owned up to this she has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with our racial spoils system\nI did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this has ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough that technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend that somebody who went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers may become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nI didn't less you have something to help you through and she's never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL kneeling thing\nYou know Trump is incredible at picking means areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less\nJust get so fired up an energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winter for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and and these different players who obviously we're dealing with the media narrative around this was oh the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling and Trump\nKept poking at this ... you know you guys better stand shoulder because Trump understands that at the end of the day a vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown some slack Moore show them that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that\nHe understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas\nHe knows that the left is going to jump in all my gosh he's being a racist white Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there uh I was very does and I'm somebody who really like the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King I beauty and the beast a great movie\nThe original or will he gets on radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox it's a great it's a great cartoon of your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's\nA the cartoons that are making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he calls born Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised they jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilized left is what we hear is why are they\nWhy are they defending Elizabeth Warren being called the ... you know she's not a Native American right we all understand this so why do they act like this is some big slide against Native Americans the point is she's a fake she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nAbout the Iraq coordination and how it was a matriarchal society and how they were the basis for our U.S Constitution\nAnd who are there some really interesting were vision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how bad technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist we're taking much of\nTheir political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the war in thing are we calling her Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice day one of the themes we're hitting on in the show\nThe left deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they're taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked in ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on the in these positions on these areas because satire is a\nVery powerful tool it's very powerful a there's a reason why we still know the names of people like Samuel Clemens AKA Mark Twain why we know the names like volt care because of their stuff it was theirs to cure a cold\nPowers right in in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was was born must be going to point out the hypocrisy of the left has here and that that she's even being considered that she's being talked about by any one of the possible [noise] twenty twenty contender is just mind blowing [noise]\nIf your windows are hard to open and close our draftee or difficult to see out of\nThen it's time to call me nobody under some for your free window diagnosis I met Mr and during

getting your way traumatized as you if not having your politics reflected back to you constantly from the president I'd states is something that you have emotional difficulty dealing with\nHe's in a fair to say that you're not very emotionally well adjusted\nIsn't it straight forward then to just point out that you got some grown up to do and you got some ... you got some fish as the kids would say to work through\n'em so I just want to know the core Ocasio Cortez who was a darling of the left now refers to leftists in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump I I'm not reaching what I point that out I'm not just basing it on their behavior\nIn trying to mock them all that's fun to hash tag on the lips it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ... now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump\nOr but that wasn't even the silliest or or weirdest thing she said I got to tell you\nI've always there are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live\nYou know we'll do it live I mean you know and you can say that to somebody and they know exactly you can say those words will do it live and everybody knows exactly we're talking about I mean that clip is it's timeless truly great\nUh there's also the maps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa like such as that young woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in it and it was the Miss America pageant or think or miss team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and and now I'm excusing the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm excusing whatever um but I Know I caught myself\nBut Ocasio Cortez had a moment that reminds me of that I just want to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider at a moment watching people like for watching what happened today and want to start at the gate and you're going to actually do that was a well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well I think\nA lot of changing our strategy around with that now that a lot of baseball and its inside the beltway that term thrown around that\nThere are very ... organizers little Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy and what it is really about Oregon I vote\n[laughter] at work organizing south on some level of strategic ally ... can gather a strategy\nPressure on the shoulders of only focus on the show is fine but that's really interesting thoughts [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting group they jumped into your ... [laughter] what are your router that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook but I quit because he was like\nThank you very much ms Tennessee likes to lead to dislike deep voice announcer man thing after like such as Matt Ocasio Cortez\nThat was John can you jumped in the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing can you do that because I I don't wanna hear the whole thing again I just want to hear the\nOh okay well close enough\nYeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organize and like outside the box and you know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational and there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair I mean that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point as very astute analysis I mean she she comes out and you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to kind of borrow from the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing\nYou know agitation at public agitation in pursuit of personal political\nUh goals right it's not just whipping people up into in a ... style mob there's something more to it than that but then she just gets lost\nAnd she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchies of patriarchy and ... and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo\nAnd these phrases that come with it and she's looking for ... you know she's looking to lock into that but she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what she's saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton does this resists we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez had his uh R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nWe should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nThat was one of my favorites uh anyway yeah OK rather court says this is the the great the great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidates who are pushing for ...\nOpenly advocating for socialism kiss you define socialism now but like she has an economics degree or can you define Marxism know\nCould you tell you much about marks or angles no but she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the rights group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of deference and and that's what you see happening here uh I I Would just note that my fear\nAnd I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawn this way in advance and you're like ... come on counties great unbelievable job\nNumbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's because of Trump because the Republicans that are in charge now ... and H I think it's gonna keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock these socialist and these leftist in the Democratic party because they sound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind or they will\nIt was dominant intermediate discourse for a long time\nThat's faded away now it's no no you're gonna make fun of us we're going to make fun of you know you're going there ... they made fun of Bush and said his eyes were too close together and he could use a Monica ones that have glasses and he's in ... and all this stuff they did that for years and years\nPushing ever really hit back nobody in the UP really hit back McCain didn't really hit back Ronnie didn't really hit back\nWe actually need somebody who when we're when we see what the opposition is willing to do will will fight fire with fire these people or clowns polo seat and Booker and Feinstein and\nBlumenthal and just go to these people are jokers only it's not funny because they're really doing harm to the country and they're willing to destroy people and do very dishonest things in the process\nYou know and they're delusional they deserve to be mocked they need to be ridiculed\nThey want to step in a public life not just conservatives then you just sit there and take it and deal with this any more and that this is important my friend okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed in the progressive left\nIs not just a little sweetener the Trump throws in their free speech is we need more of this we medium to own the lives\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nThis guy does he mean temperatures will be in the mid fifties for Tuesday mostly cloudy in the morning and clearing in the afternoon I was in the mid seventies Tuesday night mostly cloudy Lewis drop in the mid sixties and from Wednesday so many times in the upper seventies you can get your forecast anytime a WTO ... dot com key word whether\n\nThe courage to face up to things like volatile markets in Wall Street money ... if you're worried shore to lose sleep about your money do something about it tuned into the financial for Saturday's at eleven AM on news radio five eighty and Ninety nine point nine and a G\nOn the line with higher dot com\nOr of the mighty Colorado River Hoover Dam begin sending electricity over transmission lines fanning two hundred and sixty six miles of mountains and desert to run the lights radios and so's of Los Angeles\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six New York Yankees right hander Don Larsen pitches the first no hitter in the history of the world series even better [laughter] it was a perfect game that is there were no runs no heads and no errors and no batters reached first base Larson performance anchored his teens third straight went [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex is that\nI almost forgot to say and everybody [noise] half indigenous people the yeah you say\nOkay All right now now I Know this is also known as as Columbus\nDay right okay fine I I Know that people don't like to focus in on this too much because who really cares about Columbus Day and the answer is I don't know not really me I don't even know it it's not even really a holiday like John do you feel like people to even have Columbus Day off\nAnd went off and my other job so yeah oh I'm Sorry ... I mean just for\nYou to John you're the man who you're you are the rock of Gibraltar of team hot man you were always always there for us yeah you know I I think that uh it it just for me it's just\nNot a not a serious holiday you know it's not up there with the ... I Can't get that energized about it but there was a little bit of a new story here because Columbus ohio\nOh where lots of fun things happened I'm sure they are not celebrating Columbus Day so they will not so the city is named for Christopher Columbus but they will not celebrate Columbus\nDay there instead celebrating indigenous people's day so I think to be consistent or John what do you think I think they should have to call it indigenous peoples town\nRight\nThey got to rename this is like when people in Austin, Texas want to change the street names and then I go wait a second we might have to change the name of our whole sued Washington DC also has to change its name Washington D. C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm ... I I live in Washington people were always like the state or you know DC\nYou know we should just call it D.C district of Columbia shouldn't be Washington DC 'cause it gets confusing I Know that sacrilegious because our founding father blah blah but we got a state named after him and a lot of stuff named after him he's our dollar bill\nSo yeah Columbus doesn't call indigenous peoples anymore and I like to point out mostly because it upsets the left which is fun because we're we're owning lives were only lives hard these days folks freedom we embrace this because lives need to be known for their own good at this point\nThey they need people to show them that in in politics their ideology is a new level and they need to get wrecked\nNotice I'm dropping all the lingo John\nI used to know this stuff when I when I used to be playing video games I could use all the cool kids language I was about to say you sound like a game or no yeah exactly I used to I got so good at ... I got it like this special level tournaments and fever I was playing kids in\nAll the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty it the fee for anyway I was like ten years ago so Columbus Day people get all upset about because if it Columbus owned slaves and was a ...\nAnd to that I just point out or why is it that we only judge and I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this 'cause that period of in the history of the fifteenth sixteenth century as a particular interest to me you had a massive Muslims slave trade going on\nIn the America so put that aside for a moment you had a huge slave trade in the Islamic world of white Christians I Would know they were being created a slaves all over the place a lot of them a labor to to get\nWork to death or the women were putting ... you could figure out what that was all about\nA that was going on millions of people over the course of a few centuries and\nSo it's not like it was just the slave trade in in Western Europe although we're always led to believe that\nBut then you get into the Americas and you read a little bit about particularly the a Caribbean tribes or in your native tribes and the as tech and ink up people's as well as all that tributary\nGroups below them and the Aztec Empire for example was a massive empire built on slavery human sacrifice and yes there was a lot of cannibalism\nThey were eating people\nAnd when they weren't eating them they were ripping they're beating hearts out of their chest because they thought that that's what their God wanted so I Do think that there was a little bit of a need to you know a move up the the ethical civilization scale quite a bit\nSo why don't we look on that at the same time period with any horror no we'll look on on Columbus and\nAnd apply the moral standards of today to back then well if we're going to apply the standards of today here's a point that you won't hear the left me\nColumbus was morally much more advanced than these civilizations he came into contact with in the new world and a dare I say in comparison to what he came across", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "09"}
