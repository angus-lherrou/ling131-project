Fox News has the FBI investigation continues and you've got your bike Kavanaugh for allegations of sexual assault President Trump sticking by him at a rally in Tennessee in support of congresswoman Marsha Blackburn president\nI think it was maybe in the nineties they had a GPS prefers to with the first one was a you know to have to do with the song\nYou'd really have to see the movie to explain it but it was a you know you as an adult like body creek that scares me as a child yeah\nThis one there was no stopping it the police couldn't stop it it was you know it was creepy\nOkay I put it on my list I'm going to look up cheaper scrapers 'cause I'm I'm One of those people who enjoy a good scary movie it drives my wife nuts she's like what are you doing\nWhy do you want to be scared I said honey it's it's part of feeling alive and she goes okay All right now rich or you said you're up in northern Jersey you're kind of in a mixed area there are some conservatives in that part of the state and there are some a whole bunch of blue people do you blame\n'em if I'm In Sussex county whole okay\nLast conservative strongholds where just south of the border of New York Cuomo went in and and you know where the minority in the state\nWhile I hear Bob Menendez is in trouble I hear the senator from New Jersey who's up for reelection is having a tough time do you think there's a chance he could lose that seat\nI'm so I'm hoping he does I mean all the controversy with Jim and you know it's kind of obvious you know with that or Medicare fraud with his buddies and you know we have enough a corruption\nLike to hear some ... some fair the scene people in office that aren't just about grief\nWell I think the hardest thing about the politics today is any good person and scared off by what we've seen with\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and how they've taken a good man and ripped him apart over a Beijing lists allegations from three and a half decades ago so why would anyone want even go through this is Lindsey Graham said doesn't make any sense\nShow me any teenager young guy college guys is very normal you know to be attracted to girls may be remiss construed the drinking playing around\nI mean more to more normal and say like you know rumors about wonders with people like that are going on private aircraft and you know with children and things like that\nWhether it's true or not you know we'll probably never know\nWe will never know but let's just hope judge Kavanaugh gets a approved and then pass through to the Supreme Court thank you rich and New Jersey appreciate your quick check in in Memphis, Tennessee with Randy Randy welcome to the buck sects than show how are you\nHey good\nSo ah Randy you're a guy who says I got a scary movie it's it's scarier than neither the living dead\nI I've got a couple of ... is just because I thought when I was probably four or five years old premature very rational and probably nobody's heard of that one\nWell rainbow land for those that don't know it was one of the ... greatest actors in America\nAnd at the end of his career he made a lot of B movies including a one with Rosie Greer retired football player\nWhere rainbow lands head got transplanted onto Roosevelt careers body and it's one of the cheesiest horror films you'll ever see\nIf you if you haven't seen it\nYet I'll look a premature burial but you look up I think it's called the thing with two heads and its Roosevelt Greer and Raymond land and remote land also made a movie called the man with the X ray eyes which was another cheesy horror film so uh I think you would enjoy it [laughter]\nAs I was only on my list because I saw it as a child but I get a real one is and have them\nFantastically good ones I Believe I yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I still\nGo for the the kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes\nUp a [laughter]\nOh good good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks for listening to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got the just what was it six weeks left before the midterms way of work to do we have to make sure everybody we know gets out and votes\nAre checking in I have time it gets to check in with John in Delaware has a thought about a scary movie and Chuck Schumer John welcome to the program\nAnd Mike welcome back to Delaware you always seem to be in Delaware and when I'm listening to you like that\nWell I live in Delaware\nOh do ya okay great man okay cool anywhere near Dover where you at northern Delaware\nAh yeah yeah up in ah Newcastle county and I mentioned it earlier uh I enjoy time on the Delaware Bay when I can but yeah my wife and I lived in\nDelaware and the ... you live in lower slower Delaware where people have their brains and they're still conservative so I'm up in the blue part of who can say\nThat but once you get down into the robots area it starts turning a little bit below again\nYeah it ... robot this a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk or the hope at Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right man well I wanted to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nYeah there's a lot as the shining is currently leading in all voting and it's a it's a great movie behind you\nGuys I I just now started the show believe it or not I'm On the and radio and and the box accident show just started about ten minutes to go around that\nOh cool well in our\nOwn you guys so I'm just now catching I thought they show just started ... and\nNow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining is ethic\nIt it well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny we thought that Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to not have a real tragic character shift\nYou have to like the guy first he was weird from\nDid actually he came off a little bit scarier maybe a little bit psychologically stable and the stats and my correct\nYeah yeah so here here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but uh I'd ask John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer 'cause I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and they always said the Robin Hood saw in the wearing what he said today about the judge Barry said that he was a you know deeply deeply part is saying is there any ads\nThis cat or didn't notice judge from a carrot a Chuck Schumer has got a big mouth\nAnd if we don't get our little boat and we'd all you know get out there for the mid term that make things right\nAnd keep things the way they are if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're gonna have to hear his mouth for the next God only knows our long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be\nBoomer and polo sea so these are my after another one Mike you hit the nail on the head\nYeah these are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy ... nomination it is disgusting I'll get into some of that I still didn't get

the break\nI was talking about one of the sponsors of this program ... and it's a company that has a new social media platform and I think it's really important especially when we see what's going on on social media it's been weeks now\nThat one of the brighter people on social media who happens to be a conservative has been silent some talking about James Woods\nJames Woods has over a million followers and Twitter his told him he cannot come back on line unless\nShe removes something he posted he posted a comedic me him and he even said\nThis basically as a joke but they told him unless he deletes it he's not allowed back on the format and I thought wow this is a publicly traded company and and\nThen I thought well maybe just maybe they're out there making sure\nThat they apply the same kind of standards and principles to everybody who's on Twitter and I looked at and I saw the horrific\nThing the Rosie o'donald posted after Lindsey Graham went after the Democrats and the Judiciary Committee and called them out for what they were doing how they were destroying judge Kavanaugh and how they were actually make it impossible for anyone to want to be\nWell a Supreme Court justice God Knows what else will be affected by this attack on a good man but Rosie o'donald tweezers out\nAnd I have to um have to delete some of the things she said 'cause they can't say I'm On the radio she said after you you closeted idiot\nThis is the patriarchy exposed this is reality deal with it no Kavanaugh's confirmation not my president well Rosie O'Donnell put that out there and went after Lindsey Graham\nAnd she's basically here's a gay woman who's making an allegation that Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual\nHow is that allowed how is that not considered hate speech how does that not considered to be over the line by the gods of Twitter\nHow Twitter how explain I guess if you're a liberal you can say just about anything\nI guess if you're a person on the other side of the aisle it's okay to smear somebody for example a Bill Maher or did the same thing Bill Maher on his show this past weekend after Lindsey Graham gave his fiery speech supporting judge Kavanaugh\nThis was on television this weekend and appeared all over Twitter\nYou know what is bad is this process of buying [noise]\nI mean the fact that from can either find people like him or make him where I Am I thinking am I scream was stabilizing influence as the boyfriend because he is [noise]\nSo now bill Marr has smeared Lindsey Graham and he is also smeared John McCain all in in Seventeen Seconds on his show\nHow is this a loud and don't even get me started on what senator now why did attacking Kavanaugh\nSaturday Night live attacking Kavanaugh and Graham and the entire process is all about any means necessary to tear down this nominee\nBut I don't understand how one social media platform is allowed to single handedly silence conservative it's I've been shadow band if I put a post on my Twitter account at done for and if you will\nAnd I include a reference to a gun or a firearm\nIs uniformly relegated to the age of Twitter shadow banning I'm shoved off into the abyss and not given the opportunity to let my audience read it\nBut if I take out the word gun or a firearm\nAnd put in something like banana\nInstantly it's available to everybody\nI Know it sounds paranoid but it it's true so how is this a loud houses even allowed\nTo happen well I think we've lost their minds we have given every opportunity to be offensive to the left and zero to be offensive from the right\nAnd maybe it's time we all stood up and looked at some of our folks and there are alternatives to these other social media platforms\nI'm just saying oh I don't get me started on Cathy Griffin Kathy Griffin also\nWent after Lindsey Graham and called Lindsey Graham\nMs Lindsey Graham and Don Lemon over at CNN additionally said that Lindsey Graham had the vapors something usually attributed to a woman in the south so Don Lemon Kathy Griffin Rosie O'Donnell and\nBill Maher you can all make jokes that impugn a man's heterosexuality or a mock\nA man and yet you are the people living in the universe\nIt seems like the people in the universe might get a little upset too but I guess not I guess this is about any means necessary and I just don't understand\nIt or maybe I'll get a quick um movie here a
