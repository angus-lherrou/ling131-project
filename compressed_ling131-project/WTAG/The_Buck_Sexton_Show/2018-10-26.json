{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "But I I don't see it as a situation of [noise] there's some type of biased in that office if you're an African American\nAnd you have a law degree um\nYou know like you worked in that office thank God people do that's not the highest paying job for somebody who got out of law school and who has a a a lot of bills to pay and\nIf I'm an African American I graduated from law school and we know disproportionally in terms of percentage of the population of when you look at non minorities versus minorities um there's some work to be done there why am I going to take that job\nI mean I look at it as it's competitive and it's more difficult to attract\nMinority candidates into that office just like it is difficult to attract the non minority candidates into that office 'cause you got to take lower pay you got to work harder and and you don't get all the benefits of being an attorney\nJim I served as an assistant da for sixteen years so I began my career and stuff like that I for about four or five years then I went to west or for about ten years and I worked in Hampton for about two years so I have experience\nIn three different offices working under different district attorney so I speak from experience when I say that the diversity of the district attorney's office should as closely as possible mirror the diversity of the community now speaking of the worst or office\nThere are approximately one hundred lawyers in the office there are no African American attorneys there are no Hispanic attorneys as we all know was to county as a proxy twenty five percent\nMinority uh and the ... largest cities Worcester included ... outfits bird now you're up to about forty percent minority so the fact that there's less than one in Worcester in my opinion is inexcusable and what I've attributed that to\nIs the culture in the district attorney's office and let me just explain that when I got out of law school it's very difficult to get a job in the district attorney's office it's an extremely coveted job there are usually\nThousands of applications for one spot because it's it's a great in my opinion it's the best place for a lawyer to start their career\nTo oh I agree that great says it when I was giving my description I mean they worked there for a couple of years they go sell that somewhere else ... ... people learn how to be a pilot in the military and then boom all of a sudden they're working for a commercial airline\nThat's exactly how I took your comment by the way ... ... oh yeah absolutely so what I'm getting at those that's a job that\nMost lawyers us most wars graduates Moscow want whether you're white whether you're black whether you're Hispanic\nOr whether you're Asian doesn't matter it's a job that everybody wants a and they have thousands of applications so the fact that western does not have any minorities the only plausible explanation for that\nIs the culture of the office and I'm going to make a comparison Camden county where I worked as approximately sixty seven sixty seven sixty eight lawyers this seven or eight minority attorneys on that staff so that's ten eleven percent\nThat's fair not enough but it's fair you know after they're all I can get it if they were one or two or three or four gym but none I'm attributing that\nTo the culture and there's got to remember that in the office no I understand and and that's basically saying\nThere's a bias in the office yes a culture it's a culture that's created that in my opinion would\nExclude minorities and you you know where we are going with that if we say that it's a culture that excludes minority well I'm going\nTo have to be an ... an outward culture like no minorities need to apply yeah but they're not applying but they don't want to work there are sort of minority friendly office I'll give you one example one of my good friends\nHispanic attorney only working in Hampton county as the chief trial council left the ... district attorney's office and quite frankly he was forced out of that office he was treated poorly in that office and went in and this is an individual that left the Worcester office\nTo take a better job a better job in the hands in county office because he was not happy the way he was treated in Worcester\nSo that's just one example how do you lose an attorney like that\nHow do you lose a top attorney you know you lose a top attorney like that you don't treat them well so that's my opinion again I worked in an office for ten years I worked under my opponent for close to four so I speak from experience\nWhich arguably grooming an independent running for worst or county district attorney but so\nLike Roman gets elected what's the first thing I'm going to notice as a citizen that's going to be different I take it you're going to say well Jim I'm going to actively recruit and retain minority staff yes well what else am I going to say I get\nBack to it as real quickly I Would hire recruiter number one number one or I should say number one we're going to change the culture the office I'm going to make it known that our office is actively recruiting minority qualified minority attorneys attorneys and I want that actually\nMake the decision the court room and I would hire a recruiter to do that because I Want to diversify that office number two um we were focused the resources of that office on violent career criminals who continue to commit violent offenses that's probably already one and I'm not afraid to say that\nI Will take violent career criminals who committed violent offenses and I'm going to recommend\nPrison time there'll be no probation recommendations for individuals like that when I leave that office and I'll make sure each and every one of my prosecutors are putting those people that ... those types of crimes in prison and then when I say violent crimes I include\nNarcotics traffickers because those narcotics traffickers are killing people and that's about as violent as you can get German I promise you and your listeners that under my watch there will be no probation recommendation for violent career criminals who commit violent that's one of the first things I'll do\nHow do you deal with and mare dominance aren't always talking about it chief Anthony Scott nice to talk about it in Holyoke even the governor is talking about it you can make all those recommendations as the district attorney or your ADA can make it\nBut you've got a bunch of judges who aren't going to um who are going to do exactly what they want to do they have a different philosophy how to contend with that and if you start speaking out against those judges that only makes it worse\nJim as a good prosecutor you gotta learn how to sell your case you've got to give judges all the information they need and I noticed because I've been in the courtroom for sixteen years so you need to be able to give a judge all the information he or she needs to make the right decision\nQuite frankly I don't see that going on in the ... under the current administration so I see judges oftentimes making decisions that I certainly don't agree with but I see prosecutors not giving the judge the entire information that the offenders entire record the entire facts\nBringing the victim witness and to make a statement that appeals to the judges sympathy those are powerful when you bring\nA victim in to make a victim impact statements that can turn the case on his head and make sure a judge does the right thing so that's the kind of thing I don't see going on and that's the type of change that I Would make\n[noise] but where king folks get more information about your campaign\nWhile we've got two weeks left a job we vote in November sex and I certainly expect everyone to vote for Blake Ruben for district attorney you can reach out to me on my website um it's Ruben forty a dot com you can reach me I'm On Facebook I'm On Twitter\nOr where I Want people to know that the campaign is going very very well\nAt this point I'm Out there every day I just love to stand out in holding a number of beeps a number of thumbs up\nAnd I'm Talking to people every day in overall I Would tell you that I expect to win this election\nAs long as the people that say they're going to vote for me come out and vote I've got the votes the key is you know the ... yeah it's all about getting out the vote ... I'm encouraging my people obviously my supporters and there are thousands tens\nOf thousands of them throughout was to county to come out get out the vote and vote for Blake Ruben for district attorney because I\nAm going to change that office into an ethical office in an office that focuses on violent crime and just one of the thing I don't want to make sure the office doesn't\nOver prosecute I Want to make sure that people suffering from drug addiction don't go to prison and I want to focus on those people that are suffering from substance abuse disorder and get them into treatment and we're going to bring experts in our office on our staff that are going to work with us to save lives every day [noise]\nBlake Ruben everybody you've heard it the election day is two weeks from yesterday Blake thanks so much for your time\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... W E a G n double duty ADHD Worcester and I urge radio station\nClosing in on clue design ... Fox News federal and local authorities zeroing in on one state as they hunt for the person or persons responsible for tens of making bombs at the high profile Democrats and\nOther investigators are now describing Florida as a region of interest is is the FBI refined to search for the origin of some of those suspicious packages containing possible pipe bombs all intercepted in several states\nUnder penalty of perjury an ex boyfriend says she explicitly threatened to falsely accused him of rape\nAnd have him deported\nGrassley has criminally referred ... and sweat next to the deal jade FBI for three specific felonies conspiracy to defraud the United states oh barring the over broad but\nGot to show both sides live under it um\nFavorite tool of Muller but surely false statements to federal officials and deliver obstruction of a federal investigation\nWow\nOh yes this needs to happen I think ... ... is a serious and very powerful guy in the Senate\nAnd this referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this and that\nMeans folks that there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not\nA standard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records it by the way they're no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and\nI'm so I'm going to say that I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was\nA really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we ... we kept her she'll tie yes we did we held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending capital and we hear in the freedom that we were on that front lawn publicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House emails trying to get in through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo [noise] um\nThat Grassley he's not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move\nAnd this couldn't did this will mean that the deal Jay now has the ability to pull records you know\nThey they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweat making other people but you know this ... you want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're gonna sign ridiculous sworn statements with no corroboration that nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean\nThe whole thing if they can prove she lied if they can prove\nHe was part of a conspiracy for her to lie they must boost\nBe criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here if they can prove it now there is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were\nSo vague with a statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fixed but an obvious fix that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now but\nIf they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what if then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie I think about what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of a human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat Duke lacrosse team rape curbs complete fabrication a total why did you find a guy was raping her who was miles away and an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but the justice part and\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend seven to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process\nBut if we really do care about truth and decency injustice in our system if we care about due process and\nThe right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political whims of the left for their convenience\nThan people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick in scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know it now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that sweating as a liar absolutely\nAbsolutely I as I did I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't\nSay I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what would that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking much he's drinking the punch how would you spiking the punch\nHe's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking the drinks spiking an entire punishable determines drink yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she'd deranged\nI mean and that's what they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie the story will be she's not a sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was of sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coughing she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nNot oh gangs are really bad in my home town so I Want to be an American now think about what would that would mean if you expand this out how could we deny anyone in\nSyria asylum in this country how could we deny anyone in Somalia asylum in this country how can we deny anyone in go down the list\nPlenty of rough countries out there plenty of countries where people just would much rather be in America and I don't blame them for that but it doesn't make them bad people it makes them human I understand this is a great country but if we want to keep this country what it is meeting a country were ruled laws respected where we have sovereignty\nWe can't take in everyone\nAnd that's the fundamental principle that the Democrats won't accept and won't adhere to they want to pretend like we really can chicken every one and I think in their minds we should\nChicken everyone here's the problem that was what Trump is saying that how are you sending\nEight hundred additional soldiers the border of the soldiers because of policy common taught us they're not going to be doing any law enforcement activities in the U. S. interior they are US military there is providing logistic support intelligence support there helping border patrol do the job but they're not the ones affecting arrests that's customs and border well that's border patrol rather\nUm but when people in this caravan turn themselves in at these ports of entry\nThey go into the process for asylum so that means is they get to tell their story and if vote and border patrol writes it down and try to verify what they can or immigration and customs force rather write that down and verifies what they can\nAnd then those people after a pretty short attention memory can hold them longer than twenty days because of the floor as consent decree\nThose people are released into the interior of the United states\nAnd sold to come back now some of them may come back a lot of them don't but some of them may come back\nYou know how do you know what the percentages of those who have been told that they cannot stay in the country eighty five percent you know what the percentages of those who have actually been deported from the country\nLess than Fifteen Percent so\nYou know you you look at these numbers you say okay if you get into the interior of the United states you're basically free and clear doesn't matter doesn't matter if you don't actually get asylum\nAnd by the way if you get enough thousands of people going through this process from Honduras guess what you're going to even further delay the process which is I didn't really think that we're going to tell three hundred people that are living the United states\nFrom ... you know that came here from Honduras under this program and five years yeah you know what you can't get asylum and we're actually packing your bags and put you on a bus right now\nOr a plane no\nThat's not what's going to happen this is a loophole they are abusing the law\nAs it is written and we need to deal with is going to change it now I don't just want to say\nAll these bad things and not give you some sense of what could be done to fix this there are things that\nThe president can do is there are ways that we can in fact address this problem um but it will take some time going to take longer than this caravan will take to reach us\nAnd while this issue is bad for the Democrats right now I'm just wait until you have images of\nWomen and children at the border crying detained separate that they remember it looks bad right now because it's just this caravan all the march and that's what the images are but the imagery which is so important to the politics around this that imagery is going to change the imagery assumed going to be looked at these people you know the the poor to make the hungry\nAt our borders women and children\nBeing treated so terribly by Trump's evil racist government\nJust like what we saw this family separation issue there is there are a few ways really to address this I'll talk about those and then also some other stories and or I might even give you the uh [noise] ... a little bit of a a taste of the spicy a segment today from\nRising which trust me [noise] it's spicy [noise] they would [noise]\nFrom the double duty AG weather center\nHere's the latest forecast\nClerical deceiving temperatures will be in the upper twenties for friday sunny in the morning and partly sunny in the afternoon highs and the upper forties friday night mostly cloudy maybe a chance of rain lows dropping to the upper thirties for Saturday\nRain likely all day with high in the upper forties you can get your forecast anytime WPN gene dot com keyword whether [noise]\n\nExactly you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise] I find it lightly\nEntangled in and I think Pakistan Harry ... cannot have a link or I can get a country that's part of that's currently in any kind of in our country and they returned home\n\nOkay that's true but but but\nThey're being coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to ...\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American immigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get\nFlown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border and so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claims situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced the border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they are going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to your book at all what do you go to\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum is they need to change the asylum process so that you apply in your you know in your country or in the nearest country you can get two\nAt a U.S embassy and that there is a process as it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're in walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but ah as important there's something called the safe third party say third country agreement\nIs while I like to tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that it's time well spent team so the say third a third\nAttached to that at all fat white having any and I think the cat and two it's like an incredible special ... if I get to the point where\nI'm at you know on the ... again that's not right and fats but to have to I just I very much light pole\nSo okay\nI mean a bruise there Mike right I Want to bring it as it as an impartial observers here that you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth and there's nothing to do crazy there right now that's good at the conversation\nThis is exactly it's the guy's a spirit of conversation and then things get a little a little more tests like Ninety\nThere was another tweet that fad\nThat'll party is\nComprised of racists white liberal that is correct and I write the flight well let's go back I'm like ... ... ... to Atlanta for let's go back to LA part that's kinda sad about the color and the White House um why why would you ask that question\nThat has to think about like I said well why why why should I like to get to that that's why don't you ask that question because they had I had about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole crowd that young African American leader so I felt like I talk about that in fact last light levels don't realize that you put on\nTheir way out of ... ... ... ... ... ... is a place that only on how they're going to crash it that way I look I perform had any kind of social that way for how that will show fall\nAnd I find that Russia at ... I don't know if they don't let the climate skeptic ... fat and try to challenge Congress ... either way\n[noise]\nYeah I felt like I got a little I got to look at their word yelling it was civil but I felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike yeah definitely it was fun I like watching it and I like looking at the [laughter] this is\nThis is a problem whatever whatever we have a cigarette like this\nAnd I'm like well that's not really the ... the show every like puck shut up people who are fighting [laughter] I'm like well wait I thought I thought we were the trust tree I thought this was the news is that it I think we're all gonna supposed to like you know\nBlock slap each other and I'm not even ... there there's more than they were I'm like okay because the control room because they kept going beyond replay there the control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to go to break it I'm like okay we're going to break Chris was like no not done I was like damn okay here we go so uh yeah it was\nA spicy spicy one day when they will get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man my could we do that\nAbsolutely right yeah the bosses would never be the film that would be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike ... Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb it like being left living\nI'm real quiet it on assuming tell them not yeah no no he's for your do your your feisty and I know the Irish are um I'm ... I'm One one thousand Native American but I'm half I'm\nGood thanks thanks right see I I Want to make sure that we got producer Mike in with\nThe with the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of crystal even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange\nThere and um we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show what the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a\nA shall we say more more spirited discussion tomorrow of things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a a bit of debating but we've got a\nI don't we don't really have time to get to the ... ... it's a fun\nNamed to say the man that guys that guy's been treated turban certain\nSays well you know we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos we're this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it as it has come out it's been reporting here at the hill that there was exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant that you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that\nOf course is for me it's a it's a very sad it was I was impressed when John reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that uh that was not presented to the price of the court\nAnd that in my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian contacts whatsoever\nI've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy\nAs somebody who actually has no rush of contacts something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember\nWhen when it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nWith a look shaky it in his owner Papadopoulos that's how the FBI justify this investigation that that it was supposed to be Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos\nWas part of some of some crumbling back conspiracy will\nBelieve anything don't believe anything\nThis is no normal rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with thinking yeah\nThat's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nEase utterly insane totally insane there's just no rationale\nTo write all other than it it it explains for some people or gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of\nSo if\nSomeone will tell them that there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total Patsy and I don't mean that a mean way seems like a nice guy\nHe only got fourteen days in jail we've got a felony on his record now which stinks owning a firearm no voting hard to get a job you know can't leave the country probably they usually have a travel restrictions he's got and and also I I don't like that when he talks to me about this there even restrictions as part of his plea agreement about what he can say publicly\nI don't I don't like that you should be able to discuss any aspect of your case once you're once you're through the system there shouldn't be a gag order on you know once your your\nCase has you know once you've served your punishment your case is done but there was one on him [noise] so it's just that whole thing was just nuts and he was testifying today on Capitol Hill which is why we were talking about 'em there but it's the whole thing is just totally an orderly bonkers bill um\nAnd I don't know how anybody can think were they were a year ago and this would just\nQuarter period or Papadopoulos employment but no no that was ...\nTotally orderly wacko [noise] let's talk about making Kelly getting fired what happened\nThat's coming [noise] folks don't get\nCaught up in one of those Tommy corporate coffee brands okay start your day with a delicious cup of freedom\nIt's the way to get fired up and ready to take it to all the lives in your life and by the way once they try black rifle coffee they're also going to know that they've been wrong all this time they don't need to drink that pajama boy green soy macho latte nonsense they just need a delicious cup of black rifle coffee is how I started\nEvery morning and I got to tell you I distribute my black life okay cups all over the office it's a great way to make friends and bring people into the freedom revolution you need to join to go to black rifle coffee dot com slash bar you'll get Fifteen Percent off your order forget what ever coffee or drinking okay switch it up\nI mean she's making like LeBron James money to do a job that and that ten million dollar new studio they built for so she's making LeBron James Monday to do a job that a lot of other people could do quite honestly better than her for about a tenth of the money\nI in fact there were other people doing the job before that we're getting better ratings and we're making a fraction of\nHer salary people water but executives at these places these are big public companies places you know NBC and NBC Universal and they're owned by\nBig paramount or big a parent not paramount parent companies and uh\nYou know they could they can determine what the salary is right that's a good as we got shareholders public companies lots of ways to slash the money around without any cruiser Mike oh no no no I don't make a say in sixty\nNine mill none of them like I Know that for now that's her severance I'm In a year in salary that's for her full they're paying out her full contract\nThat's what that sixty nine mill is I'm I'm Talking about you know the uh\nThe year to year so we should make a lot of money but it's like a ... she really worth that the answer was no\nUm you know they some of these people get in touch with the corporate structure at these places and they get huge huge paychecks but anyway\nSo then Megan Megan a had a few bumps here and there I forget exactly what they were but she oh she brought up a Jane Fonda is plastic surgery\nWhich I didn't realize Jane Fonda would be so sensitive about but she was and it was kind of a weird thing to bring up in the interview on the circumstances and that was kind of a bomb for a you know for her to bring up in that way just wasn't wasn't smart\nAnd anyway the latest controversy which has gotten ousted got booted from NBC\nWhich you remember she gets booted right away for this folks you know\nSpecial sex dungeon door closed by button under the desk Matt Lauer guy was there for\nDecades and was the the the chosen one I mean the the face of that network twenty million dollars plus a year I think it was actually making more like Fifteen when he was twenty five million a year they're paying Lauer unbelievable sum of money\nFor a skinny balding we'd who was completely replaceable by about a hundred different people but\nAndy lack in these people at NBC make decisions they liked Matt Lauer is that's all you have to do they like you you're good you know it's not about the ratings it's not about the audience really\nWhat the what the exact thing in the in the east sweet or the C suite the corporate suite east we should be the way it's called so Megan decided in in a segment on Halloween and political correctness\nDecided to tackle the subject well that was the subject in and here's what she let's start with what she said that got her in trouble John Cleese place that clip\n[laughter] you'll get in trouble if you are a white person or a black person it puts out white away like\nA kid that was okay as long as you address another character in the country and there are places in New York with ... as she got that Diana Ross and she made her skin darker than it really is and people said that that was racist and\nCould she wants to look like hanging around for one day I\nI don't know how like that that rate Harlow\n\nSo she didn't say anything racist what she said was that\nShe doesn't think that people necessarily dressing in costume when they dark and their skin to be in costume should be considered racist now you could agree or disagree with her I Would note that a lot of you probably liked the movie Tropic Thunder I think it's a very funny movie I think the best part of the movie is\nUh what's his name Morton Downey junior right at the guy please Iron Man isn't that his name William ... what's his name again you guys leave me out here to dry well what is the name John\nYeah Robert Robert and I'm more Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey do more than ... yeah Robert Downey junior show so he uh you know he ... he was in black face in that show I mean and that's a movie he was he was driven by his protest to be a black man in blackface and they make fun of it during the movie and it works and everything's pretty much it's a funny movie\nYou know there was no picketing there are no people freaking out about it at least not really and a movie did pretty well actually\nSo there are situations in which culturally black face has not been deemed to be a insulting and racist I I just named one now I also can understand why given the history of\nSlavery and segregation in this country in the way people used to dress in black face in in in ... [noise] excuse me in mockery ah that that would be offensive to some people I I get that and I'm I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black race under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to the wolves on this one\nAnd then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology\nI'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] when they heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness at Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume fooled okay\nWell I was wrong I Am sorry\nOne of the great heights of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface playing an awful way by race in this country it is not okay for that to be part of an old costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nI could have told her making a\nCalled me up and I have a soft spot\nFor her because she used to be nice if you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future and that I was amazing when I filled\nIn for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and you know so so I have a secret soft spot and maybe not so secret anymore for Megan Kelly I'm just going to be honest about that okay I Do\nEven though I think that she turned over people and made a horrible decision by going to NBC and was on grateful for the positions you had at\nFox and all that okay fine I would've advised her because I understand\nHow this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of millions of dollars\nI mean how could Trump even comply with what they're saying here let's say Trump came out and said I won't use enemy of the people anymore for the media I won't say that any more do you think that then they'd say oh okay that's reasonable\nYeah you know Trump toning down the rhetoric I guess he's not such a bad guy after all I Know I I guess I guess we've got a letter\nYou know they wouldn't do that you know that's not what would happen that's not what they say\nThey would say oh that's not even a start to this oh he's so terrible\nThey just want to hate him they don't\nReally want him to change his behavior even if he did change its behavior wouldn't really matter to them\nWouldn't matter so I'm\nJust note that by the way you know one one little sudden I'll throw in there I've never really cooked bone and pork chop before\nAnd this\nWeekend I'm hoping to uh actually give it a try went to a butcher especially Bush or and got a couple of big thick bone in Port jobs I Want to make a little spice rubbed Fordham maritime overnight tried to sue them my cast iron I miss talking to you all about my corner adventures it's been a while so that's all and I haven't had the time to cook recently\nSo this is the I'm going to try to bring this back because one of those things that when it's done right I just think so incredible is a shared\nA shared bone and pork chop is something special as you can tell I haven't eaten yet and I'm doing this radio show\nAnd I am quite hungry\nSo that's what got me my mind my mind shifted a pork chop land because I'm starving and it's been a long day um\nBut we do have to talk about Hillary coming up your men roll call and then maybe I'll get a searing myself a\nPork chop so\nMuch more important stuff coming up so they wouldn't be doing [noise]\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nClerical this evening temperatures will be in the upper twenties for friday sunny in the morning and probably Sunday in the afternoon ... the upper forties friday night mostly cloudy maybe a chance of rain most job interview up at thirty cent for Saturday rain likely all day with high the upper forties you can get your forecast anytime WTO gee dot com key word whether\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is back [noise]\nGee what can I Do that will uh brighten up your day a little bit it's been a tough week for America right no question about it the market's been getting battered obviously we've got these ah bombs getting sent all over the country people are being nasty\nTo each other there's moms everywhere and all that stuff right what can I Do that will just bring it all home and make us remember you know what it's all going to be okay um well what if I told you that\nChelsea Clinton's thinking about running for political office\nI see what I did there that's right I got you ready for one thing and then I pulled out another part\nShe is thinking about it which means she's gonna do it\nShe's going to do it folks she was talking to the journal news at a stop on the tour for her new children's book starting now you can make a difference just\nJust try to you know she she really needs more cash she lives in a ten million dollar apartment in New York or mom's worth a hundred million her husband is a hedge fund guy but you know what what whatever kind of cash grabs you can go and that's right\nHaving children's books ghost written for her oh man oh man it's amazing\nShe Chelsea said quote I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it match my talents I'd have to think if it's the right choice for me\nShe added she doesn't have any plans to run for office but it's something I think about as I Hope every young person thinks about first of all no\nI Do not want put put aside Chelsea Clinton for a second here why put aside or Chelsea and just know that not every person not every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have the kind of a thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that feel called to serve but increasingly I think politicians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this and I think that everybody should\nI Love is where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is staying power but maybe the conversation about terminals will have to wait for another time\nI just think that the Chelsea Clinton to the notion that somebody would want to vote for this person who's never had a real job\nAre and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails were startled very poorly at the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where she was supposed to be a\nA boss and a figurehead at the same time uh she was not well regarded there are people thought that she acted kind of like the ... boss's daughter which is what she was\nAnd I you know this is one problem are going to have on the right now and I want to get too deep into this but\nWe one thing that we have given up is for for quite a while we're not going to be able to complain about nepotism we're just not not with any not without being as hypocritical as the left is so I and I'm not saying that this is the end of the world I'm not saying it's a huge deal\nBut just to understand that when they try to put forward\nChelsea Clinton and they will\nThere's cause the Clinton it's it's the Clinton named the Clinton brand is still so well known and by so many Democrats despite what they'll say about Hillary behind\nClosed doors are they still think of the Clintons at the Kennedy ask dynasty they really do and Chelsea doesn't have any of the baggage of bill or Hillary baggage on baggage or just you know likes to say hot ladies uh doesn't have any of that so they're going to trot her out\nAnd people like me will say she has no record of any accomplishment she's a brat she's never had a real job\nAnd and likes to go and give lectures what is your getting people lectures on what is she going to give speeches on\nHaving jobs that she's been given because of who are parents are no the the the struggle is real being a\nA political celebrity and incredibly you know what I mean it'd be three incredibly wealthy people throw thirty thousand dollars that you first speech when you're not even go to public speaking that's what she has I'm not trying to be me and I'm trying to just give a real assessment of the situation\nAh and I'm telling you she's going to run so if you think that we've had the end of\nTalking about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton dynasty and I know I said that this was going to this was meant to cheer you up but I I guess you could say had fake EEO because obviously this is a go to accept some of you I'm not really but it's it's a little annoying", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018",
