{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Thank you so much for your time and thank you for your service\nOr\nRented that was great I'm so sorry that I hold you up thank you day perfect\nOf course the answer is a different person to person but there was a survey done to find out what's common in the ideal for the average person and a here's here's what we found out unfortunately we only have Fifteen truly perfect days each year\nAnd you know what it's not the big days it's some of the most trivial things that make us feel the best\nWell let's find out more about this and uh she's a return gifts to the show she's really a happiness specialist up Pamela Gail Johnson good morning gamble are getting more bang for the most trivial things make us happy\nThis survey was done with two thousand people and and actually they are different than probably a normal day though that we have would be um you know and doing these things there's\nThere's two exceptions but one would be that amount of time we as we can spend doing them because most of us have jobs and apparently in a survey that people the perfect day does not include working and then they ask her is that temperature because the ideal temperature is Seventy four so that sort of\nYou know out of your control depending on where you live\nYeah Seventy or yeah yeah that'd that'd be a nice a regular yeah I think it would be an average Joe\nYeah every most most of us don't live where it's Seventy four everyday we probably can't we can't create that element basically this this this survey kind of sad people want to wake up about eight eight ten and they're going to bad about ten fifty so that means they're getting enough sleep\nSo bad that it's kind of within our control we can always get enough sleep then they want to spend four hours with their family three hours with friends three hours outside and three hours watching TV [laughter]\nThree hours watching TV while\nThat's outside\nIt was a lot so I think those are things we probably can't do those things are not exact amount of time um if where you work and have my life\nI we we really should be able to do most of the things with the exception of the Seventy four degrees we shouldn't do most of those things every day I mean we we always need to try to get enough sleep because that is a key to happiness if you're too exhausted you you're\nIt does impact your happiness and hopefully you're spending time with family and friends every day even if they're your work friends friends are key to happiness at work\nUm hopefully we do spend a little time outside every day unless you happen to live and like Texas or super hot right now every day [laughter] we've seen some time outside because nature is is that happiness this dark and wondering TV or reading a book or listening to music or wherever your idea\nAnd leisure time is you know we all need to have a little bit of that you know wind down time\nYeah we're talking with family Gil Johnson about this study that was done and by the way she that happiness specialist which is a great job I guess I mean technically as a as a happiness specialists are you happy all the time\nNo no I Am not\nDoing a pay a post about that on on friday 'cause we call it the practical happiness principles and the first one as you know happiness\nThat brings up every one so you know most of us you know do not have a\nDay in which we're not dealing with any hot unhappiness chaos stress or annoyance as one of those four things probably are going to shop and everybody's day I'm like determines our happiness I think is about how we how we deal with it and how it how do we manage them\nAll right okay so that's an honest answer and that's pretty good now when we talk about these three hours of watching television\nOut as the whole um electronic pacifier play into this and I and I'm One of the people who's guilty abusing that all the time only because of work too and I'm an information Junkie I'm talking about the smartphone device\nHow does that play into it could we substituted that for the TV Time for three hours\nTo call your leisure time I didn't find it interesting that social media wasn't you know part of that perfect day people are saying time you know on line so I thought that was kind of an interesting piece but I think again the TV it's just a\nBigger version of a bigger I'm ... for just some leisure time like when what gets you just you know what what led to decompress now if you're on your your gadget being there for ... are being annoyed by whatever you're reading that I wouldn't call that decompression time\nOkay yeah again and I\nAnd I are happy time if you're like reading in your life you know a year you know you're having ... or whatever it is you're doing or you're having fun on one of your social media sites are news sites\nThat brings you smiles and your decompress and then that's that is fleet your leisure time again and probably just sort of depends on where like if I tried for playing games or you know what what exactly it is you're doing\nOkay now what do you think was missed here you're the you're the happiness specialist and I and I've learned to I used to work in marketing but when you do a survey you don't always get every answer ... ... you know ... don't take every answer literally\nUm you're you're the person you're interviewing you may not be asking correctly what do you think is happening in special with specials was missed their good night's sleep they said that time with family time with friends\nI'm a little time doing their decompress stuff what do you think we're Smith are being outdoors what do you think we missed\nOut on a case if I'm going to answer from us decided perspective I was going to I Would say that one of the things that can help you be happier as to expand and broaden your definition of happiness\nBecause we have thirty one type of happiness so it just helps you notice more happiness we actually have that out an ad because of happiness happens month this August\nSo you can you can get that S H pay 'em in your op search but there's a counter can count the number of happy moments you had based on his thirty one has to happiness\nSo I think that's a way to expand it they are all I thought this is really had the main components meaning they said that people said they wanted to spend seven hours with friends and family [noise] so\nI think if you look at most happiness studies\nIf you really had to boil down and say what's one\nThing that makes you happy it is our relationships with other people and feeling connected me I'll be that a friend or family that your actual family be that you know we're you know wherever it is that we get those those social connections\nAnd I thought this study showed that it also showed sleep which is you know deals with your physical health yeah it should be outdoors which is a you know a good place that we know it's just the happiness recharge her\nOverall has leisure time you know like hey you gotta have your wind down time too so that they showed up pretty balanced life\n... Johnson is a happiness specialist and uh just made me happy with all the information from the study in her analysis of Pamela where folks get more information from you\nOr also add on SO H. P. A. dot com or just Google secret secret society of happy people and we should pop right on up\nSo you're not all that secret when you get right down we want to be the best known secret in the world [laughter] family deal Johnson thanks so much for your time thank you so much for inviting me I have a great day\nYou know sorry Pete envoys list\nPrice dealer price to bring out your if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms\nWhat do they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not any more until you about price from two car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season since reason vegetable you'll know if you're a true prices competitive ... shows you what other people are paying\nDue process or just basic fairness procedures oh it's not a legal process it's whatever we say it is and it's\nIt's all about what we can convince people to do because it's it's really just a battle of rumors right or just ... people say things there's no evidence there's no there's nothing to say we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the less can control\nNow impeachment is in fact a\nParallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they are gearing\nUp for so whenever we try to have the argument that\nTrump was not found guilty when it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office\nA which is essentially whatever the house of representatives decides he is guilty of\nNow they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be\nThat President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the\nRacism and massage any insects isn't all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments on policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle\nOf reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's you know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage or not\nAnd just oh he's a T don't vote for him he's ... which is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump\nAll along but there there's a development and his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work\nUh I don't want us in my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS\nTold the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday that his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify ... define ... what is that your pie him take away is pie\nDefying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition the lawyer Joshua levy toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not satisfying the first and fifth amendments of\nThe constitution are now I understand that this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness or procedural protection\nAnd there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward\nWho would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking offense but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the CIA ... who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public will win back the situation I think you do have to ask yourself\nWhat the heck is going on here\nYou never see a greater revelation of information\nFrom this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things\nIt's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambushed year and smeared they're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get to the facts and get the truth\nSo I just would note that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller knows that you know to to put more kind of\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out they're all working on drugs more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word for me for achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election let me get more information but the the Democrats are all in a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff and ... the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nHere than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a proven puppet but\nI Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues at the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I really do hope and I'm I'm holding out hope that Trump declassify those Pfizer documents on the investigation origin documents that\nThat I think he should\nDo before the election because in my opinion that could be a game changer\nIf you've ever found yourself when sitting at the weak sauce taste of coffee from one of those left leaning county corporate brands\nYou probably thought yourself I Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased trading bathroom a foreign policy and other things that defy common sense and more time on their coffee\nThat's why you need black rifle coffee I drink like rifle every

people are going to do is what they want to do so you know it it is what it is with that that really that is the attitude that you get from them or ... you know where's the core alerts you don't have the corollary or the um the\nAnalogous position on the right when it comes politicians there is no right wing version of antifa there's no right wing version of the Democrats who are saying get up and people's faces and follow them home\nThere is no right wing version of lunatic protesters who show up wearing ... on top of their heads and and screaming and shrieking at Senate committee hearings\nYou know there's there's none of that we don't do that\nAnd so I think it's important to take a moment for all of a say there this is an both sides thing this mob mentality\nThe shrieking and threatening and crazy behavior [noise]\nThis is a problem predominantly in overwhelmingly of the left\nAnd it's going to be a problem for them at the polls unless they can lie to enough Americans and act like this is a problem so we won't let that happen folks we won't let them get away\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nShowers likely to see the temperatures

was you know because when it comes to the fight for self taught never saw [noise]\nI'll bet\nIt would cost me you know I see these people say oh Trump gets rich being president [laughter] I'll bet you I lost billions of dollars it's cost me a sense of what my friend is a very wealthy friend said you know how bad it costs me two or three million dollars and it's worth every penny of it [laughter] I don't need the money\nAnd it's worth every penny because I'm doing so much for the country yes it's it's nasty\nIt's yes it's incredible the false reporting is so incredible\nBut honestly I'm doing a great job and that's why I have huge crowds these crowds are showing up of I don't do a good job they have it that when they pick up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere they getting two thousand dollars that's a lot of money to people\nI think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump\nAs I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more now that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about oh Trump the twenty Fifth Amendment we should get rid of him\nBut they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in the position now forget about don't say his tone is terrible he's a racist and oh my God you know bring up all this stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there's a feeling of optimism about the nation\nAre certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise trumping I I also think\nThat when we start to evaluate why is that we've had some of these ... there was a couple of Saddam and these are related and and I'm just really thinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been on my mind for a while teams all share with you\nYou know you have these these never Trump or types who have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which teams are that they can say they're\nNot never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they um they hate this president so much and that there are so many people\nWho come from ... not exclusively government backgrounds\nBut I I think come from backgrounds were they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one she isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management of that\nOther people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nThe you know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June presidents are Roger every president since advisory more words and you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip through it offers and\nYou know you get these guys do the whole their whole resume is this long stretch\nOf government work and and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better than somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector and the real world\nAnd hasn't made this crossed over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this I and I'm really aware of it now that I'm In the swamp in DC they really\nDon't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out I don't want that but this the insecurity of losers in a way that is very clarifying\nWhat's on her

nothing left because I just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy food is being now following hurricane being brought in a way of\nUnbelievable large amounts of water\nAnd everything that people could have won the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working on the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies [noise] ah the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most part\nThey're open enough to get the electric companies and and a lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity has already found that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration\nShowing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast\nA but one interesting side of this end of the first priority at first thought of everybody is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nOf but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks ah you had Ron descent\nIt's his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC that is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called\nHim a shady millionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and had a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people are pointing out that that this is a\nDifferent thing than what you you would usually expect remember running attack at the ... in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads specifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were\nTrying to either batten down the hatches or or or wait until they can return to their homes by what of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's there is such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with all the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these border\nRaces are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the\nSenate race 'em and they're going to try to\nExtrapolate from that for the implications for the presidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea here being the Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies that he's opposing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know ... if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be a but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American um and and that's\nWhat the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you\nKnow minority representation they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nUh identity politics is is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they're getting slammed by category for hurricane\nTo take the ads are taking negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of of where that all is and uh I I Do believe Scott is going to pull it out but you guys gonna make are going to make a close\nVery close\nOh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you um and I just I've been waiting to have a night where you know I I'd have the time to read it and we can really dig into it together I

I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured him and beat him to death\nOf rule murder and then just remembering his body putting his body parts in their bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's\nIt's funded by the country so you know take it with a grain of salt one minute he's based paper claim they have a source telling them that the body parts of ...\nSo the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in the residents of the consul general of ah of Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi\nOfficial may may have these body parts barriers backyard and this is crazy\nI mean this is if you read about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on\nThat so that so outrageous not only\nIs this not if you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear and I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are probably the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this nothing happened\nThis is all crazy conspiracy theories you know you could assume all that\nUm but and then that'll give it some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have pretty good intelligence and police forces\nAnd plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and sort of Saudis to do this on Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if you went to Saudi all bets are off we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know\nSo they did this in Turkey a well keep in mind that a cause show he was a permanent residents of us now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states but that the Saudis would do this just show brazen\nAnd now you have all these different politicians you'll Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay you know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey but people are saying is going to be held to pay\nA seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal\nBroad daylight you know ours assassination inside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil\nThis is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off\nYou know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely ordered at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top level of Saudi Government props by NBS himself this is crazy this does not happen\nAnd people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be ... former Russian nationals\nThey've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in there for a Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national\nBut as for Russian national and they never do it in a diplomatic facility though and they certainly wouldn't send multiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are to ethical for this they're just not\nSo foolish as to do this\nBut then you get to the ... the then you get to the book then you go to the point where you have to ask you is hold on a second to the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are set in the past that\nYou know sometimes burning dung village sends an even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sense a stronger message too\nBut you don't have to burn down everything you can just make an example of one\nAnd here you have a very high profile critic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of the\nReally what what is a mafia state and then the Saudis or a mafia stayed with a religious veneer I mean that but Saudi Arabia is a is a a ... you know the ruling family has enriched itself to the tune of who knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades\nThere's Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive goes all the way back to the unholy although they would have thought it was holy alliance between the fundamentalist preacher\nOn the Arabian Peninsula even Abdul how from the Eighteenth century\nBelieve he was born in Seventy no too I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety to ... liberal maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords and that's how you get Saudi Arabia\nBut they merge together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer ...

difficult to decipher because if you've ever read the Koran and there's a lot of [noise]\nUm but they killed that they've they've killed this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems on the international diplomatic so you know I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this\nWhat looks to be most brazen high profile assassination of a rush that that I can remember stay with the\nSocial media sites are the future of conversation my friends we know this I use it as a powerful tool and reaching out to you and spreading the word about the show and you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but we've seen so much\nEnd anytime soon but we want the Saudis to be in the mix because we need the Saudis to be able to stare across the border at Iran and say you know don't don't step out of line oh and we want the Saudis to be a counter balance\nBecause they are the primary Sunni Muslim force in the Mid East now and obviously the primary Iran I mean the primary Shia\nMuslim force in the Mid East is Iran so we we really do want this this balance of of powers ah because otherwise we feel like we're going to be the ones that are working alone to try and box in Iranian proxies and and prevent\nA kind of Shia crescent from becoming a realization that could be a very real strategic threat to Israel to Austin to our our interests more broadly so that's where I get to the I don't think we're going to do very much about this\nI don't think there's gonna be a whole lot of interest in taking major actually see a lot of tough talk about this Trump is saying and make some very uncomfortable he doesn't like it but no administration I think would do all that much about this\nUh there won't be any judicial proceeding I don't think the Saudis would never extradite anybody under these circumstances to us they're not going to extradite people that were traveling under diplomatic passports to the Turkish authorities for a trial there\nAre an interesting side note that you won't hear I think on any other show ... has\n... is not it look he was murdered it was terrible but just if you want a little more background on him he's actually very pro Muslim Brotherhood he's very pro Islamist he is not a liberal in the western sense of the term and an off in western journalists make this mistake they think that just because somebody\nIsn't on board with the uh old school Mideast strongman authoritarian regimes that they must be you know pro democracy pro women's rights in fact the show he was very opposed to democracy\nUm he wanted a I'm Sorry very very opposed to liberalism\nHe saw democracy only as a means of instituting Sheree uh um he was somebody that that believed in using the Democratic process to achieve theocracy whereas what you have in Saudi Arabia is essentially Salafis and without elections he wanted Salafis them but people voting art first\nAs you know once you get to that uh once you get to that place of of having a theocracy elections tend not to last very long in any meaningful way because you don't have the civil society below them to allow for the kind of conversation that would result in democratic process he's being meaningful\nSo ... is not this liberal reformer that a lot of journalists you talking about not not at all but he was a critic of the Saudi regime and you know you have this geopolitical reality and then there's the another reality\nAnd I can say here but I can tell you that a lot of places you won't hear much criticism of this you won't hear it talked about as a story even the Saudis have\nReally spent a tremendous amount of money investing in media in this country major corporations they're huge shareholders and major corporations\nAnd they also have invested a tremendous amount in some of our most prestigious universities\nSo they have an influence in cultural and information based institutions here that allows them to mute the criticism\nAnd that's something that we should all be aware of the Saudis have bought into American\nAmerican media in ways that let them call the shots and you won't hear talked about because they're caught a lot of shots they've written very very big checks and are not shy about throwing their weight around on these issues so\nKeep that in mind because when you look at what's going on with Saudi\nAnd you look at how friendly all administrations stretching back really for a century now in America are to Saudi Arabia [noise] it it's remarkable and this is\nThe argument the second most totalitarian state on the planet and we act like they're a bunch of good buddies of ours and it's just for reasons of short term self interest but we should at least be able to be honest about what's really going on there\nAnd I think the murder vis journalists might start that conversation [noise] from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nShow is likely to see the temperatures will be in the upper fifties for friday cloudy in the morning and clearing in the afternoon temperatures will hover in the upper fifties friday night mostly clear much cooler temperatures drop into the lower forties for\nSaturday mostly cloudy maybe a chance of showers a much cooler with highs around fifty degrees you can get your forecast anytime WTO ... dot com keyword whether\nHolding the line for America bucks back then is that\nAm a bully last time you think you are the most boring person enough that he might be for the last time I\nMight be bad for the first from an online have yet to came from a certain amount of time to have you found in Colorado [noise] now how cooking\nAnd I got to tell you I think that the the first lady ah first of all she she's right in saying that she\nGets just really mistreated by a lot of folks out there she's really never been treated like a first lady a there's a very widespread both in the open and behind closed doors a ongoing mockery and undermining of her from a mainstream\nThat seems to just want to discount that she was a successful model that\nHe speaks I think five languages and is an immigrant who is now the first lady of the United states that's just never the story with her they always jump passed all of that and they say oh you know she's a third wife and she has a funny accent and all this stuff\nBut even putting that aside from us because we know that there's just a a different set of expectations that the media has for a Republican versus Democrat first families when when you compare\nMichelle Obama's lunch program uh with what I think the first lady right now I'm ... trying to accomplish online bullying really is a is a scourge and it's a cultural issue that is relatively new and then I I think it's\nCorrosive to our society a whereas the theme was ... I forget I forgotten some of the visuals of tried to bring them back right now the doctor you are but Michelle Obama's lunch things yeah let's just tell kids they all have to eat like boiled kale\nThat's going to go over really well if you saw some of the the lunch initiative the first lady was pushing and what you thought kids were going to eat I mean yes theoretically you could tell people that have\nTo baby carrots or some alfalfa sprouts and an apple and maybe a tiny tiny packet of\nOf almond butter instead of that's lunch but I I don't think that's necessarily going to take off in terms of popularity I'm not sure you've you've solved solved a child nutritional issues in our schools by especially making sure they're going to be hungry and not enjoy lunchtime", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "12"}
