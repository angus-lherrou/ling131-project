{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "I mean I look at it as it's competitive and it's more difficult to attract\nMinority candidates into that office just like it is difficult to attract the non minority candidates into that office 'cause you got to take lower pay you got to work harder than in you don't get all the benefits of being an attorney\nJim I served as an assistant da for sixteen years so I began my career and stuff like that I for about four or five years then I went to west or for about ten years and I worked in Hampton for about two years so I have experience\nIn three different offices working under different district attorney so I speak from experience when I say that the diversity of the district attorney's office should as closely as possible mirror the diversity of the community now speaking of the worst or office\nThere are approximately one hundred lawyers in the office there are no African American attorneys there are no Hispanic attorneys as we all know it was to county as a proxy twenty five percent\nMinority uh in the ... largest cities Worcester included ... outfits bird now you're up there about forty percent minority so the fact that there is less than one in Worcester in my opinion is inexcusable and what I've attributed that to\nIs the culture in the district attorney's office and let me just explain\nThat when I got out of law school it's very difficult to get a job in the district attorney's office it's an extremely coveted job there are usually thousands of applications for one spot because it's it's a great in my opinion it's the best place for a lawyer to start their career\nDo agree that great says it when I was giving my description I mean they worked there for a couple of years they go sell that somewhere else ... ... people learn how to be a pilot in the military and then boom all of a sudden they're working for a commercial airline\nThat's exactly how I took your comment by the way it was like oh yeah absolutely\nSo what I'm getting at those that's a job that\nMost lawyers us most wars graduated from law school want whether you're white whether you're black whether you're Hispanic or whether you're Asian doesn't matter it's a job that everybody wants a and they have thousands of applications so the fact that western does not have any minorities\nThe only plausible explanation for that\nIs the culture of the office and I'm going to make a comparison Camden county where I worked as approximately sixty seven sixty seven sixty eight lawyers seven or eight minority attorneys on that staff so that's ten eleven percent\nThat's fair not enough but it's fair ... year old I couldn't get it if they were one or two or three or four a gym but none I'm attributing that\nTo the culture and there's got to remember that I worked in the office no I understand and and that's basically saying\nThere's a bias in the office yes a culture it's a culture that's created that in my opinion\nWould exclude minorities and you you know where we're going with that if we say that it's a culture that excludes minorities\nWell don't you have to be an ... an outward culture like no minorities need to apply yeah but they're not applying or they don't want to work their assault a minority\nFriendly office I'll give you one example one of my good friends\nHispanic attorney ... working in Hampton county as the chief trial council left the ... district attorney's office and quite frankly he was forced out of that office he was treated poorly in that office and went in and this is an individual that left the Worcester office\nTo take a better job a better job in the Hampton county office because he was not happy the way he was treated in Worcester\nSo that's just one example how do you lose an attorney like that\nHow do you lose a top attorney you know you lose a top attorney like that you don't treat them well so that's my opinion and again I worked in an office for ten years I worked under my opponent for close to four so I speak from experience\nWhich arguably agreement a independent running for worst or county district attorney but so\nLeg room and gets elected what's the first thing I'm going to notice as a citizen that's going to be different I take it you're going to say well Jim I'm going to actively recruit and retain minority staff yes well what else am I going to\nGet back to it as real quickly I Would hire recruiter number one number one or I should say number one we're going to change the culture the office I'm going to make it known\nThat our office is actively recruiting minority at a qualified minority attorneys attorneys and I want that actually make the decision the court room and I would hire\nA recruiter to do that because I Want to diversify that up is number two um we were focused the resources of that office on violent career criminals who continued to commit violent offenses that's priority one and I'm not afraid to say that\nI Will take violent career criminals who committed violent offenses and I'm going to recommend prison time there'll be no probation recommendations for individuals like that when I leave that office and I'll make sure each and every one of my prosecutors are putting those people that can make those types of crimes in ...\nAnd then when I say violent crimes I include narcotics traffickers because those narcotics traffickers are killing people and that's about as violent as you can get German I promise you and your listeners that under my watch there will be no probation recommendation for violent career criminals who commit violent that's one of the first things I'll do\nHow do you deal with and married dominance aren't always talking about it chief Anthony Scott nice to talk about it in Holyoke even the governor is talking about it you can make all those recommendations as the district attorney or your ADA can make it\nBut you've got a bunch of judges who are going to um who are going to do exactly what they want to do they have a different philosophy how to contend with that and and if you start speaking out against those judges that only makes it worse\nJim as a good prosecutor you gotta learn how to sell your case you've got to give judges all the information they did and I noticed because I've been in the courtroom for sixteen years so you need to be able to give a judge all the information he or she needs to make the right decision\nQuite frankly I don't see that going on in the ... under the current administration so I see judges oftentimes making decisions that I certainly don't agree with but I see prosecutors not giving the judge the entire information\nTo the offenders entire record the entire facts bringing the victim witness and to make a statement that appeals to the judges sympathy those are powerful when you bring\nA victim in to make a victim impact statements that can turn the case on its head and make sure a judge does the right thing she'll just the kind of thing I don't see going on and that's the type of change it I Would make\n[noise] but where king folks get more information about your campaign\nWell we've got two weeks left or to we vote November sex and I certainly expect everyone to vote for Blake Ruben for district attorney you can reach out to me on my

there are thousands tens\nOf thousands of them throughout was to county to come out get out the vote and vote for Blake Ruben for district attorney because I\nAm going to change that office into an ethical office in an office that focuses on violent crime and just one of the thing I don't want to make sure the office doesn't\nOver prosecute I Want to make sure that people suffering from drug addiction don't go to prison and I want to focus on those people that are suffering from substance abuse disorder and get them into treatment and we're going to bring experts in our office on our

be brought to justice [laughter]\nYeah yeah yep yep yep\nThat's what the vice president says does that change any of the ... or any of the junior here I'm from the media and there's no\nI actually saw someone said today or I forget the journals another blue check you know Twitter journal person\nUh say that the Trump statement where he said there's no place for political ... this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like well does he have to give us an hour long speech Amish or what they're going to criticize matter what he does\nWhether it's a show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier today actually there were just talking about the president's it's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objections to a bomb or that I thought he had bad ideas he\nWasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretended he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level actually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I'm going to bomb I sing you know that's that seems admirable\nBut I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed and I think all that\nThat that's come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump and now because some maniac somewhere we\nDon't even know why yet but some idiotic somewhere set these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle maybe here's what they were saying about an earlier in the day is liquid for\nHow sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election it gets hot the lie he changes his story again and says we're going to get through it eventually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid where officially and parents and in fact France on\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's putting all out there in spreading a lot of lives about non white people to all white crowd to make a well a lot of what the president saying it's just\nNot true the same to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health oxygen sales why\n\nIs a an an article of faith now have you have to say this all the time\nWhenever asked them what what's the law I looked really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done was forethought with malice and that had\nOn the lives of tens of millions of Americans negative impact what what is the law that lines up with that but that his crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I can recognize as game kind of joking around and talking is normal people do\nKnow he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to the worst possible scenario and never get tired of it either oh my gosh\nYou know in the left in the media they they find endless ways to reach a limit on the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage miracles his brother I Know I I just get frustrated with it too it's it's so tiresome and\nThey're all their calls for civility right they're they're being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftists their calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again they like\nThe old order where we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and\nSay oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game\nThey're not saying let's all be good to each other they defend them up and the restaurants we'll talk more about that later\nThey defend these tactics that it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to this stuff\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down\nAfter Eighteen months of propagandize into their base the president's a traitor a sexist a rapist or a you know a racist or everything crazy going to start a war is a fascist they stopped they said about President Trump it's it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life\nIt is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close\nNow they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously is people are these people are\nReally in need of a reality check 'em really and you got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him don't really care to a\nBut this is a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarves and opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because you with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika\nA now because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump\nRage rants and first doing today is on Christ like I mean this is here's what's covers that place six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame\nThat we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic [noise] not only the most basic American concepts\nAre what we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read and some Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a\nAre beneath them\nThat we're contemptible but we're gross that we are um uncouth uneducated\nAnd you know ill bred you know we are bad and that in fact\nA lot of the way that they yes they report the news and they share information and and just their perspective their point of view is tainted by that it's not just Trump did they despise just like whenever I talk to you but the second amendment it's not it's not really about guns about gun owners\nAnd with Trump don't let them get away with oh it's it's well some of them will be very open about it it's not just Trump it's Trump voters\nThey don't just despise the man and his policies they despise all of us who have put our faith in him to get the job done in fact they despise us so much that they refuse to believe is very important\nAnd you can't understand the Trump phenomenon without knowing that he's in that role for very specific reasons we've been trusted him to do certain things that by the way he has been doing\nUm and\nTo shake up the political establishment to take the fight to the left and you push for less regulation less taxation\nAll of the things that Trump has been pushing for it and doing that's why he's there he's not there because we think that he\nNever flies off the handle a little bit maybe a little too salty with his language you know as a little bit too much of a a maybe an excessive libido in his past him and all of those things that those those are and it's not that we are not aware of those and it's not that I think those are good things it's just that\nOn balance I Want all the good stuff that Trump brings to the table and he's doing that\nBut the Nicole walls of the world the world too stupid to make that kind of a calculation\nOr they want to hold us to the Romneys standard of put an ineffective Boy Scout up there so we can tear them apart and then we'll pass you on the head and we put another leftist in who destroys the economy and socialize as medicine that's what they want to do\nThat's the plan I I'd rather not I'd rather not allow that to uh to happen not not on my watch if I could avoid it away or\nRussia collusion fall out of the headlines tomorrow but I have George Papadopoulos on rising with me so if you want to see that very interesting interview uh but I wanted to know something 'cause you know this guy's got some prison time\nAnd for what a has a felony on his record now and the whole thing is such a joke around him but here's a congressman ice it talking about this play eight\n\nWe're going into an election in which real wrong doing two years ago is still not properly investigated well a special investigator Mohler is continuing to indict people for unrelated crime is an active though there's collusion when he hasn't had one piece of it then he's been able to demonstrate so\nThey the voters are going in with some very interesting misinformation or lack of information and two years is a long time it's too long and we should have deposed him today\nYep\nI completely agree with ice in one part of this whole election that we don't talk about enough\nIs how it is tainted by dish a deep state action against the president not just the effort to create this false Russia collusion narrative but also the Mueller probe which Grimes along and what these trumped up oh conspiracy against the United states charges itself is crazy\nIt's nonsense and that affects\nVoting that affects people's mindset about this president and really profound ways so you know the left has already stacked the deck there already cheating\nIn a sense already playing dirty and\nWho knows how much dirtier I told you you guys members I started a couple of weeks ago I think we've got another October surprise you know I started on this show we got something else that's going to hit us and I can't tell you exactly what's going on today but I can tell you that\nWell certainly a surprise um\nWe've got to have a Joe Jones joined us on the mechanisms of those bombs and we're gonna talk about the caravan so much more showgirl switching topics shortly set right there with me team you're about\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nVery cold this evening temperatures will be the lowest thirty for Thursday bright sunshine high is reaching the mid forties Thursday night clear skies Lewis driving to the upper twenties for friday mostly sunny with high number forty you can get your forecast anytime but WGN G ... key word whether gee [noise]\n\nFamily you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise] so the big\nStory that folks is about farms that have been sent a v the mail in some cases maybe hand delivered I Want to bring somebody on who is a true\nBomb experts we have with us Johnny ... Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance disposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat and his role as an EEO detect\nAnd that he knows everything about these devices how they're built\nHow you tracked them and what they can do a job a great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAll right so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about these devices\nBunch pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there of what's notable to you about these bombs\n[laughter] well you know I can only go off really the the information ... giving and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going up what we see what we hear 'em and so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both see it\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the von did either\nOnce that time or hit a certain time and a free determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sounded noise and so what you do you take the same signal that same electrical signal to reroute that into a circuit that detonate the bombs so that one normally the light would come on the bond at night so but normally the bell would ring and an arm clock\nThe bond that nature of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so it's so switches of breaking a circuit\nThat an arming a and arming mechanism as another breaking the circuits so the circus still open\nBut once the army and gets closed in the next thing that closes the switch will set it off so we know and and the use of timing devices\nThey're used for one of two things either to pre determined when the bomb goes off for to keep yourself as the bomb maker time to get away from it\nBefore it's on and so if this bond is a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture but if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way then we would call this a time device or other time to arm or trying to debt date\nAnd being that within a seal package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation that we kind of have to believe from what we can see from that picture that at the time to detonate device meeting they said\nYou know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it was theoretically detonate\nThat's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey ... in this this is going to be a very uh ... the sloppy way to try to target an individual right I mean as soon as this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing\nDevice on it and you'd have to be guessing when it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely could blow up still risk to people can really could kill somebody but could blow up in the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it's it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much information to divulge and detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening and there are certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart and the information on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of I speak meaning that it\nCould function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or take apart what is there to recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces that gets\nMore easily point is in the right direction when I Would say where do you really I'm just like an off in a shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at now seems to be ... hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage and was it actually put through a a delivery service or someone just hand this package to someone outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars to take this and that the only thing we don't know and those those leads those human lead\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over at Quantico with the FBI utilize some tools techniques we have this safely disassembled this bomb\nEight hundred for one

for in the last week although actually following you are doing this I mean I I must have ten people have been yelled at until they had the leaf restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I'm OK with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nAnd Mitch McConnell yes Mitch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton had a trial and I walk up and eating out or they do but I I\nIt's not clear that there was Hillary ... says she leans there's always something being unpleasant\nAnd something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're disagreeing about you know I if I were rated children from their parents and I went to dinner in a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed certain Harlem\nSo there you have the big separation okay especially in a day like today where we're going to be\nA lecture by the left about about civility all of a sudden keep in mind that that exchange that was an soccer crossing show not tonight but last night uh that exchange\nWas between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Felipe rains and of course Tucker\nWho people will say looks like book so it's bucking took a or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't do it they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but\nThey're having a search engine you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know the harassment and stocking\nAnd mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like that is acceptable they don't say oh\nSorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't endorse or we're not associated with this isn't representative of us\nThey actually try to justify this behavior and I keep having to point out to people that the the line between if are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or or even just the family members or friends\nAnd people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken on either by me or buy them right I mean on one side of the other is though that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little shy of one person who just cross easily they're already screaming your face they're already yelling at you in a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you\nAnd trying to intimidate you you really think it's that hard for one of them to all of a sudden you know get a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that but what so important is that the left I you know as soon as those idiots went after Nancy Pelosi I said and every other conservative that I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left it to the ... of the Democratic party a big favor\nA boat oh by the way they talk specifically about that and rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it flows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves her restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I've never okay I think what happened that she thought she was fine\nThe other day she was ... she was with her any you don't see any of us up and said Nancy Pelosi I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... use foreign policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think an offer so let's say you got to ... and that's not what happened was I just don't do it because they're not ... in the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be said and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like soccer have the kind of platform may do or they can push back on this nonsense conservative we had a political culture\nAnd our political culture in this country\nIs unacceptable to a you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right it's one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heckle people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I I don't think it's certainly dangerous to the people right at the Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know ... where does that stop\nWhat am I waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder what Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment in in uh on Capitol Hill or in downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they fall ever you go you know this whole notion of ... in public so they can be a target of or disdain now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear them a Democrat said things\nLike oh sorry the kids just you know enjoy their frog legs as they sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of it just as childish talking points stupidity you know you're a lot of the older the ... or you know their roast chicken while the poor people out in America are suffering right I mean\nThey they try to create this whole narrative justify their whiny childish ... which is really a very\nCommon and very widespread characteristic of activists Democrats their whiny screaming children\nAnd they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does an important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got sleep rains are Ryan represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction they're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that\nBefore election [noise] really interesting study I saw this week about how people ah don't really trust Facebook that much anymore [noise] well that's really not surprising is that when you see all of the stories out there\nAbout shadow banning about gaining the algorithm so bad it pushes progressive causes and shuts off discussion about things like the second amendment about free speech about any number of issues that are really important too\nConservative that's why we need a space

Y. dot com again sniffy dot com [noise] no censorship no agenda let your opinions be heard\nSniffy dot com let's get the discussion rolling [noise]\nThat often gets lost in this discussion that's why to remember that we we have\nWe are bringing a million people a year into the American family either us citizens or as green card holders\nEvery year a million people every single year ten years have passed we have ten million new either permanent residents were citizens in this country who are formerly citizens of another country where at least permanent residents of another country\nWe're bringing people all the time and huge numbers through our legal immigration system\nAnd yet we are told that if we don't take\nThis group of refugees were that group of refugees are this group of illegals or that group of illegal that were terrible people and we're a century the equivalent of white nationalist and those if you are listening who are not white and who agree with me on all these issues you're not a white nationalist according to the left you're just a I guess the nationalist but\nNonetheless a which is you know they also think is a very very very bad thing I saw a CNN trying to make some trying to make some hay of that you know oh he's a nationalist and trying to not to think it was actually Jeff ... who who said\nIt doesn't really mean it doesn't mean Nazi as them to try to get them and and you know one of the anchors at at CNN or one of the correspondence whatever's like oh no we know we know would match with SARS terrible terrible\nWhat he said oh of course it is um they they want to get away from the story of the caravan um because the left realizes that this is a loser for them going into the election\nAnd there are there are constantly dealing with the following\nTension or the tension that comes from\nNot being able to tell them this is true the Democrats in general they are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they

non white regions of the globe\nThat is a widespread left wing belief you see it in in uh in academia you see it and media uh this is not unusual at all\nAnd in fact some of the Obama administration approach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the bowing and the apology toward America has a lot to apologize for\nAnd the dysfunctions in Central America are somehow according to left is the fault of America and therefore we shouldn't be saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force the American taxpayers to subsidize\nAll the
