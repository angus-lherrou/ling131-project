{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Wouldn't ask a question of Dr Ford\nAfter she left the party and left her behind and of course her friend is said well I Believe her but I don't remember any of this if I'm somewhere with someone and somebody leaves unexpectedly I'm going to have a question like\nWhere's Danny where's where Steve where they go where are they and then when I met up with them I'd say what happened to you where were you\nHappened I'd have a question like man you just ran out of the place you didn't say you were leaving or anything oh one other important thing here\nRemember\nWhen prosecutor Mitchell asked about the going to um California to get her testimony that it was offered by Chuck Grassley the chair the committee said will do anything will go anywhere to answer these questions to ask these questions of you and she said\nOh I didn't know that\nI didn't know that\nI Can't do it like that woman does she said she didn't know that\nShe didn't know that one of two things happened\nShe's either ... lying which right there that's perjury sorry that's perjury or her attorneys didn't tell her that that option was available\nMissed this puts her attorneys and Dr Ford in a difficult position\nBecause of the attorneys didn't tell her\nThat is a violation of the code of ethics of the ...\nIt can bar association actually their professional conduct if you add a lawyer\nAnd someone brings an offer it to the lawyer or provides information to that lawyer and Matt lawyer representing you doesn't provide that information to you\nThey are violating the code of professional conduct it's a simple as that it's just like um if you've ever bought a house\nAnd you're dealing with the real estate agent and you say to the real estate agent you know I Want to make an offer\nAnd that real estate agent doesn't bring that offer to the seller\nSame thing here so we got to we've got to a very difficult situation here did Dr Ford perjure herself did she lie or worse than the attorney who was picked out for her\nBy Dr ... by a dye and Feinstein's office did that attorney not tell her that the offer was available and here's why that's plausible they didn't want her to be interviewed in private\nThey wanted a spectacle\nThey wanted her to come out\nThey wanted her to cry in public they wanted the white male Republicans to look bad\nBy asking her questions when she's a victim\n[noise] Mitchell also said\nThis goes on not the memories that she couldn't bring back from thirty six years ago but memories in ... in her testimony when she was asked about things that have happened within the past couple of months\nMitchell said Dr Ford struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post\nThe Washington Post wrote that she provided portions of or therapists notes to a reporter but in their testimony\nFord could not recall if she showed the post full or partial therapists notes or her own summary of those notes remember that part I I don't remember\nI don't remember this is from Mark Thiessen by the way you wrote this column she could not remember whether she took a polygraph the day of her grandmother's funeral or the day after we're talking about this was August\nFrom the time that she gave the testimony we're talking about a month\nYou can't remember a month back way to get better she was unsure whether she was videotaped are recorded during the polygraph\nA PHD an adult woman taking a polygraph couldn't tell you if they were recording or not\nHere's another thing she couldn't explain\nShe said she called the receptionist at our Congress woman's office\nTo reach out to talk about the accusations she asked\nBut yet she says she didn't know how to get in touch with Dianne Feinstein who happens to be your senator and then she got into that story well to be beach people beach friends told me my beach friends and I love to meet these beach friends oh you want to get in touch with your congresswoman\nWill just call her office but yet they they couldn't tell her out and get in touch with Dianne Feinstein who happened to be your senator too like\nI Know how to get in touch with Jim McGovern not that I Would want to and I know how to get in touch with Elizabeth Warren or Ed Markey not that I wouldn't want to\n\nHow come she couldn't do that why couldn't she do that\nNow people are going to say it's unfair to pick apart this testimony\nAll right\nAnd they're going to say victims of sexual assault often have trouble remembering key details\n\nBut it from memory is the only evidence she as against Kavanaugh\nAnd she has all these inconsistencies that's got to be taken into consideration\nAnd without any cooperation I don't care what side of the aisle you're on if you want to vote against cabin are because you don't like his ideology that's fine the Democrats aren't saying that 'cause they really can't attack him on it\nAll of his rulings have been found\nThey've been picked apart but you want to not vote for him because you think he's a rapist you've got someone with a very very weak case against him and that's not what this country is all about and don't give me the job interview bologna and don't give me the um this isn't the court of law\nHe is for a job in the highest court in the land\nAnd the way you conduct yourselves as the Judiciary Committee should reflect that you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space station [noise]\nMoving forward with confirmation I'm rich Dennison Fox News the Senate is going to do to take a procedural\nVote tomorrow setting up a weekend confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a\nKey vote and Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation ears supporters and opponents are making their voices heard\nZip ties thank you John whispering in my ear zip ties he must be a a veteran of these protests\nSo that that's what happened today in Washington I expect it's going to get bigger and Wilder tomorrow I expect we're going to see more protests them more craziness but you know what you're not going to see I Hope you don't see any more of the silliness\nAround judge Kavanaugh's year book and the focus on things like the devil's triangle\nWe played Senator Whitehouse mocking Kavanaugh talking about a bar fearing booth thing and the devil's triangle which cabinet insisted was drinking game White House\nTold them he thought he was lying to him that he didn't believe it was a drinking game that he thought that was something nefarious here\nAnd if you go to the Urban Dictionary which I advise you to not do it at work and you look up the devil's triangle you will see that it is a an some definitions a a ... with two men and one woman\nBut in the era of judge Kavanaugh the devil's triangle was according to some of his classmates who wrote a letter I Am in possession of the letter right here that was sent to chairman Grassley right here right here [noise] got it right here\nDeer chairman Grassley and ranking member Feinstein so went to both of them we're classmates have Brent Kavanaugh says from Georgetown Prep a Jesuit high school in Washington DC area we write to clear up any misunderstanding about the phrase devil's triangle that appeared on our\nNineteen eighty three high school yearbook including on our individual your book pages that phrase was the subject of questioning a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing last week and has since been discussed in the media oh has it\nThe devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school\nIt was a variation on the game quarters and if you remember judge Kavanaugh said it's a drinking game senator do you know quarters and White House like now I don't know anything about that\nThe letter continues when we played devil's triangle for people sat at a table\nOn the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle\nEach of the four participants took turns being the shoes are attempting to bounce a quarter into one of the glasses if the quarter landed in one of the glasses the person at the table using sitting at nearest that glass had to drink the beer\nWe do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in your book to refer to any kind of sexual activity to us it was just a game\nWith glasses and the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not know it since the early\n... Davis Bernard McCarthy junior Paul Murray and Matthew Quinn these are four classmates\nSo they sent these letters now if you go into the same year book and you look up a Bernard McCarthy in McCarthy's yearbook page he\nAlso uses the same F F F F F F F that Kavanaugh dead which we know refers to the F word and a friend of theirs who used to quote have a long wind up to it when he would say ...\nAnd uh he references squeaky another one of their friends and he also claims to be the founder of the devil's triangle so uh I just wish somebody in the Senate would say to these idiots\nYou realize how stupid you'll look when you say stuff like this that's absolutely insane that this is getting this much attention and Senator Whitehouse is out there saying well\nWell I don't believe you so that means the White House is firmly locked in and believing that there has been a ... between Brett Kavanaugh and another guy in his high school despite what everybody\nElse says it's maddening I Know\nAnd now the mainstream media is going to jump on a soundbite that came out of justice Paul Stevens' his mouth that ah earlier today surface the Ninety eight year old former Supreme Court justice\nWho had many liberal votes behind him claimed to be a lifelong Republican is now saying that he doesn't think Kavanaugh should be on the court\nI don't care what you think sure you had your term you can sit down now go sell your books that's what this is about\nI got to shift gears from it yeah we're going to talk about China too because China is really important to me\nUm [noise] you need a break from social media well not all social media is bad so I ...

I I don't want to hold you over 'cause we have a garden chain joining us do you think Chuck in Florida Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nA believe so and you say if he does say oh I sure hope you're does\nYeah 'cause if if he doesn't get confirmed you think it's an absolute death knell for the GOP controlling the house and maybe the Senate\nThey're definitely going to lose a lot of ships if he doesn't get from the skin to look bad for us\nYeah I agree I think we owe it to point would be if you can't confirm him why in the heck\nWith any of us be expected to go out and vote in the mid term

it's the godfather Michael Palca sitting in for my friend bucks X then tonight I Love this audience and you know today today I was very busy monitoring all the Kavanaugh stuff\nBut uh if you drifted over to C SPAN as geeks like me will do you may have caught this moment\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tanks scholars journalists\nAnd local state and federal officials and more civil\nChina has initiated in an unprecedented effort to influence American public\nThe two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and what China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next meetings going to be with Donald Trump and Kim Jong Owen\nAnd this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbooks and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it a Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today\nHow are you I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population a resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense or not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them\nBut I think China is starting to get to be a a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of our naval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents are we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters the the Chinese have been acting recklessly\nAnd I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder the one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately\nAnd that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China\nAnd that's a good thing and so the restrictions working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that in vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to people you can find it it's on line and you can do something is Kiki is going to C SPAN and watching which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential to be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations\nI'm Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions and I think he is a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that speech to me was welcomed now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the or the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states\nAnd so what they're doing right now is trying to huffing and puffing and bluffs um the American public and to caving\nI don't think that that will work but nonetheless um that's I think the Chinese reaction to this the Chinese have been waging a trade war against the United states for a very long time and we've been sort of oblivious to it um but what the Trump Administration has done and what the president has done\nBut when I

got access to it this morning\nAnd then the one side saying it's Thoreau and the other side saying it's not enough but we all know they're never going to be happy with it\nUh and then the protests and now the yelling on TV as people I I don't know why these panels on CNN and MSNBC and says\nWell we're going to have one person from the left one person from the right and we're going to try and keep it simple it's never going to be simple the people on the left are on hinged there is on the ... they accused judge Kavanaugh of\nBeing ... it's real people\nThey're craziness is real\nAlright thank God we have some of the smartest listeners in the world gym in Pennsylvania is checking in Jim welcome to the buck Sexton show tests due to my friend\nHey good to talk to ya\nWhat's ... what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWhile I think myself I think the reason why North Korea is trying to stall on out and some of the other issues that we've had going on is because they're all waiting to see after these midterms\nIf Trump's gonna get impeached or add more problems because if that happens then they're in the clear\nThey're there they will find we won't find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does and that's what they're hoping for\nA ... you're getting her feet and waiting to see what happens and and our media plays into that too because they keep for a vote and all that\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think a diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are froth thing at the mouth going we're going to get the house and they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get them out and I say you realize that means President Pence will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on people who are sticking it to America way do you see what President Pence would do and they were going to get him to who we got a plan for him to so I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress\nIn Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo uh I think it's about time and it's about\nTrump being blustery in his speaking and then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep an eye on that gym but thank him for checking in\nLet's ah stay in Pennsylvania and ah see what's on Felix his mind Felix welcome to the buck sects than show sir\nHey Michael hey I was a big fan of Howard Stern back in the bank and I want I Want to vindicate him when I went to college in\nSeventy eight Seventy nine and ... it was very comic to say that girls and women went to college to get the rest of the great\nWell I I understand that we're talking about oh let's go a decade forward and I don't know if the ... degree was as much of a cultural thing in the late eighties and the early nineties as it was in the in the seventies and I think saying it in twenty Eighteen\nIs a rather insensitive to the women today it's kind of insulting to women you know I'll tell you what you go to a woman today a twenty five year old woman say why don't you just work on getting your eye Maurice degree towards\nRight now I understand that but when you go back to that day I mean I Wonder if you go to school there in ... in the early eighties right\nNo late eighties he was in high school in the ah that that was the whole argument about this and that she initially said this happened in the mid to late eighties and then she chose high school was eighty three eighty or eighty four for him\nSo he was getting out of college in the uh late eighties and that things are a little bit different back then\nYou know I and I already had a female vice presidential candidate at the same time but it yeah I understand what you're saying you're saying a stern was making a reference ... but I'm Talking about his references to day used to\nTalking about women getting I'm not exactly sure what that meant\nBut uh I think that was something we weren't supposed to hear or was supposed to say but there it is a Michael Pollock I'm my name is ... the godfather to the box next an audience and uh I'll be here\nTonight you want to hang out you can join the conversation we're going to talk more about cabinet all going to try and

for tomorrow morning I Do get the wall Street Journal and the\n... every day I'm One of the last people I think in my town who reads it\nThe old fashioned way with a cup of tea in the morning flipping through the pages of the wall Street Journal you know that's one of the greatest papers ever\nSo I Believe judge Kavanaugh and I believe this this will also filter into the minds of some of the people who are on the bubble\nSome of the senators who have not stood up and said what they're going to how they're going to vote\nBy the way senator Shelley Moore Capito\nHas said she is going to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nShe has come up and made her statement probably serving West Virginia and I wonder if this will put a little pressure\nOn a Joe mansion the guy who's ...\nAnd his job\nMaybe we shall see way she'll say\nThat that was something else I had to get to today I Know a yesterday\nIt's about a middle of the afternoon yesterday we had that test of the presidential alert system did you get yours it or to Eighteen east coast time I happen to be playing a little golf I sneaked in\nNine holes of golf yesterday and in doing so I was on the golf course in the middle of a back swing when I got my presidential alert message and it was loud and it was cool and I thought All right that's a good thing\nAnd then I saw what Michael Moore put out yeah that Michael Moore the big fat guy who makes movies who sometimes gets awards for his movies and he made that\nAnd height nine eleven movie years ago and then he thought wow Donald Trump's election was on ah eleven nine I could do Fahrenheit eleven nine to go after Donald Trump and his movie has been a miserable failure\nSo Michael Moore who believes he's one of the guys who predicted Donald Trump will get elected Michael Moore came out yesterday after the test\nAnd he posted this on Twitter quote it was just to test but make no mistake about it this is the world in which we now live close quote and then he goes on to tell us\nThat's the final line in Fahrenheit eleven nine and he has to tell us\nThat because nobody's gone and seen the movie the movie as Bert virtually a losing money it it was a stink or from the first weekend it was released probably the worst failure he's had\nBut he said that was the last line in my movie Fahrenheit eleven nine a few minutes ago Trump gave us a preview of the state of emergency he is creating to justify the end of democracy is we know it resists\n\nAnd I'm just wondering what Michael Moore would he be unhappy if there was an attack and nobody got him a message or would he be screaming going\nNobody tell me nobody tell me this is going to you\nAnd I just wrote back to him I sent his message back\nTo him on Twitter with a note saying dude\nGas help\nI'm sure you have health insurance and I'm betting it includes mental health coverage as well stepping aside\nFor a second you want to weigh in on the Kavanaugh conversation we also have to get to the uh South Carolina situation\n[noise] um\nThat's kind of a hidden post inside the party helping Hillary out so I guarantee a if she holds ferment says I'm not going to vote for him they will have a special secret place for somewhere\n[noise] and that's possible but as a lot of democratic friends I'm Sorry okay but\nIt's like we're all living in this job three wars or the other um but a lot of them or or start you know that they're starting to walk away because of just that\nYeah that walk away movement is very strong and I think in ... we could mark we could make the argument on both sides of the aisle that
