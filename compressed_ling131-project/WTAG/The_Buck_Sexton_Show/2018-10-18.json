course the Saudis are bad news or there's no there's no good guys in that whole spat between the Saudis and the Turks and what's going on there's there's nobody that we can look out and say oh we can trust their word on this one now we've got to verify but this idea\nThat because Trump calls Jim Acosta clown which I Would note that oh you know Obama used a trash Fox News ... network that provided anything of a voice of opposition at all\nObama used the trash Fox News on a on a on a regular basis and no one said anything about it really was the one network that stood against it and\nYou know that they're saying that because Trump is critical of the press because he expresses his opinion about uh media apparatus that is entirely against it\nBecause of that um\n[noise] he's ... he is somehow complicit in the murder of his journalist journalists have been oppressed\nAnd detained and murdered and foreign countries for as long as they're journalists new but this is all the anything\nBad that happens in the world is Trump's fall to the left anything bad that happens anywhere in the world of any consequences you can say it's Trump's fault if their sexism\nSomewhere it's ... it there's racism somewhere it's ... ... ... ... dictators desperate stressful they skip past the fact that as I said to you yesterday Obama's inaction and did the ring and cowardice as\nCommander in chief contributed to a half a million people just chewed up in the meat grinder that was a Syrian civil war horrific violence\nAnd you know Obama was is nowhere to be seen in terms of leadership nothing if anybody made the situation worse made sure that there were arms that got into the hands of the hottest I mean that's\nWhat happened so we're we're going to hear from the people that are okay with that about how Trump isn't able to do this but it's just so typical isn't it it's just so\nStandard operating procedure from the left and I got I got to ask Dr Gorka today Sebastian Gorka was on was on rising demand got to ask him and say you know hold on a second um what do you say doctor gee I'd like to um ... good guy\nWhen he ... the people that are always talking about Trump is too cozy with dictators you just look at the actions look what he does\nI mean you know Trump has his way of finding gray sheet him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state\nAnd this whole standard that they set up is nonsense a standard that you know Trump path to talk or you know super aggressively to turn everybody and he needs to hold to the\n... this is nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings with food and then Kim Jong on these others\nAnd essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy uh you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential\nYou can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing his prize or because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage\nHey Trump that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the left now is infused with this anti Trump rage\nOh you know they aren't really that cause those

you know there is a a story out of Texas or that there are in fact that there has been a a an effort to engage in\nRigging votes and I think people are now facing felony charges or you know there's this Texas vote rigging scheme is getting just a little bit of coverage and you know here it is to women to Texas women arrested on vote fraud charges in Fort Worth\nThey targeted seniors in the city's north side this was Star Telegram\nSo the here's what they were doing the scam allegedly was it they were targeting older voters and they would they would use that would get their mail ballots and then try to have them sign them or they were trying to do this fraud and mail in ballots All right um\nThe complaints on this is what the the article says you're the complaints focused on mail in ballots which allow people to vote from their homes\nWithout any ID or verification of identity a key concern has been how often people may assist others or physically helped by witnessing a with filling out the applications for mail in ballots were the ballots themselves supporters have long said melon balloting is crucial for overseas residents in the military and senior citizens\nCritics maintain that such voting is ripe for abuse and raises concerns about vote harvesting in which people can fill out amateur and other people's ballots\nSo here you these Texas women who were accused of stealing other people's\nBallots for the Democratic party by the way oh what a shock a Ford signatures ballots cheating all this stuff and it's for Democrats\nSo now people go to prison for voter fraud were always told there is no voter fraud and then I I talk about a case like this and they say oh well okay there's some voter fraud but then why do they say there's no voter fraud\nYou know what the thing is they don't know how much voter fraud there is and they don't want to know\nThirty counts of voter fraud according to a statement from the Texas attorney general's office okay these are people who are trying to cheat and an election\nNow you could say why would they do that some people are just true believers some people are probably getting paid off to do it but at the end of the day they also believe all along that there's almost no chance that they're going to get caught how do you get caught\nThe Democrats fight any form of verification any form of election integrity and security at every turn and they say oh it's racist racist\nAlways that uh always this notion Democrats pushed that\nAny hurdle it in the in ... when I heard all any integrity measure right like can you showing ID when you vote shown idea when he cash a check right he showed ID when you wrote anything like that is specifically to target minorities targets everybody it's generally applicable because of the history of the voting rights act and\nAh the fact that the Democrats still like to pose as the great heroes of the minority underclass in this country that is their position that is there that is what they do um with all of that\nYeah they they don't want any election integrity measures and they want to keep pretending there's no voter fraud even when people go to prison for voter fraud [noise]\n\nFrom the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nFinally told you this evening and cold lows dropping to lower thirties for Thursday sunny and much cooler

we have a lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about the enthusiasm to blue wave but I think we have tremendous centers yes\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm\nAnd I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh he is I I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think it was not same interview that that has really got me\nA concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if if it's\nCyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nStation or anything in this country or say oh this guy but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell I think ...\nIs the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak\nTo them [laughter] but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last inflation numbers at very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I would say this there were people that writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even if the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached\nPoint where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening around the country and sure enough\nI'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be some rough water and that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of\nUnraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years to keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans\nVery very high uh we're more indebted now that when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and you know deeper or deeper in debt and we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that\nI'm not I cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there the far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does and all the rhetoric but they liked it they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional\nAnd willing to take action about all this\nAnd with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nReset right if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent like that interest payments on the debt start to crowd out the private sector and the rest of our economy\nI I think it's really funny where he said he was so upset when he was a writer on Saturday Night live\nThat he just he quit but in quitting he screamed in the face of a ... of his boss I guess it was Lauren Michael's but mine but somebody else screams very drawn quitting I'm Out here a little thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend he realized oh my gosh what am I taught\nI don't have a job a that was a great job I made a terrible mistake and then he didn't know what to do and thought and fall and thought and then he figured he figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday I pretended like nothing had happened and it worked everyone just acted like he was fine and you just you know they maybe they forgot to melt out or just chose to ignore the whole thing but\nThey wanted them there and he showed up at everyone just went about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what it was one thing she's going to do when it comes running for the president's editor approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is a descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person is you know John Smith honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan use seeing with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas move yeah it's fine\nI mean the best is it actually does you know I Know people are going to get married for this one I think you gotta figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tie for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck and neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast of I Know it's a little more for has to be a little more for the ladies\nBut it's very well done was the first animated film ever ... okay bakar poker back to a descendant of the real Pocahontas\nOr you have it ah what what you saw here\nWas that the left has this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture boroughs and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a\n... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very wide speed northern northeastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCoal culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native Americans specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cookbook called powwow chow\nAnd stole a recipe from my real French chef\nAnd called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next breath the United states by the way\nYou know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know\nThere's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding of it and say you know what that person maybe across the line with that or\nThat went bad but I can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them\nAre and and I played that story for yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really their parents were\nOr you know that the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren about a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back Native American ancestor\nThat's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but cultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again the most oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume although I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we get some normal people involved oh who have\nSomething about you know this Halloween you don't wear a costume that's offensive twenty culture or a culture ancestry or whatever okay so now that means you know no no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just want to read or what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any\nAnd did he that's non white for a Halloween then so is it really just white people that are allowed to dress up in and cultural gar\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing\nBut I don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's what offer you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all the power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a underrepresented indiscriminate minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups and I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes like to use those groups for their own power so close to appropriation as they're stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did is not cultural appropriation\n[noise] there is no such thing he does not exist even ... [noise]\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home titled fraught\nWith the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called whole title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title walk found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your whole had it been real steep would've taken out loans using books home was equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments are eviction notices showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies today who title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title\nMaybe that's the really the plant that's what they think that's where the aid of the Democrat Party is right now on I I Believe\nThat is true you know Nancy Pelosi who is just such a such a Charlotte him you know what is Nancy Pelosi central she's this incredibly rich courtesy of her husband are disconnected from normal people self involved political power broker that's what she really is\nHelping people care about people on that people do see\nWhat do you think about it or what what can you point you oh or or great achievement was ramming through Obamacare\nThat's that's fantastic talked to somebody who has to deal with Obamacare now or lost their health care plan and tell them how great Nancy Pelosi is I think you'll you'll hear some four letter words this is now where it where it's all gone this is this is the reality of trying to deal with them\nUm and by the way ... essentially endorsing this anything goes at any cost attitude play Thirteen\nSay why have they\n[noise] I was glad they have to say that\nYou see she's saying and this is part of the disconnect you have from a left she saying on the one hand do you have to do to win big right do whatever you got to do\nI mean that that's really what follows these views on this new whatever you got to do I just don't let the Republicans way\nAnd then the same time she's saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from\nAnything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds me what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh travesty that was televised for the whole nation see after all that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried\nTo enrich your lipstick fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was wasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nThat was the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to such extreme lengths and engage in such reprehensible behavior no they can't really think the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves have to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did the gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean violence and and widespread civil

and beyond reproach is insanity but that is what the radical feminist on the left seemed to suggest they also seem to believe that sexual agency in central decision making ease this very\nMurky area where you know if two people are drunk and they consent to intercourse but then later the woman decides that she\nDid not think that that was a good idea or you know it's always the guy's fault meanwhile if it's about alcohol and that's what dealt with the consent wouldn't the female be equally libel\nOh now we're going to get an who is more drunk and you know we're lines drawn here at what point is consent consent the left I Would note for a while was pushing for the idea of having digital contracts before you could have sexual intercourse essentially woman would have to initially your smartphone this Israel they talk about this\nThis is really a psychological problem that much of the country has happened\nAnd this this left wing radical feminism is so corrosive and so destructive and so nasty and yet anti mail it against men it's not just about\nWomen it's not about women's empowerment is not about equality under the law\nEats about finding ways to unleash the anger that the subset of women have against men\n\nAnd then you have a case like this where they've admitted there's evidence they lied they they tried to ruin a young man's life by the way he'll have those psychological scars for decades to come being falsely accused of sexual assault twice when you did nothing because girls didn't like human thought it would be amusing\nBut there's no there's no charges against them oh 'cause why oh that's right 'cause they're victims\nBut wait they lied so they're not victims how Garry you women have a right to be believed but these women admit that they should not have been bullied so what are we to make of that rational response to this would be to say oh\nMaybe what the left promotes years toxic\nMaybe it's destructive maybe nobody should buy into this notion of a left just being believed but we haven't yet gotten there as a society we still\nHave these elements that push this notion that there are different standards of evidence and different\nJustice expected for men and for women\nAnd that shouldn't be the case and the people who are pushing this nonsense are really doing a disservice to this entire country [noise]\nUm and that their their ideas are him defensively [noise] unfair and stupid but they become shrill and nasty and hysterical over it and the less sees it as a political when so they allow innocent people even to

what do I do oh happy learned how to part\nUh so the headline on media today CNN executive trade barbs with X CNN commentator I don't think of myself as an ex CNN commentator technically that's true but you know just there for a little bit I I don't know\nBut you're shoveling stuff although they didn't say stuff to score cheap points obviously this uh the person writing is a media to live so he wanted to go with a big line from the CNN\nSo a senior CNN executives throwing down with box section is according to media I'd a former political commentator for the network Africa conservative pundit criticized the network's coverage of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry\nThe ... began after the right wing host of the hill TV posted a critique of CNN is reporting on warns attempt to prove or Native American heritage warns claim has been a source of criticism for years in this week's you open yourself to scrutiny or again since or DNA test results they her Native American ancestry ... only one in one thousand and twenty four\nSo here's what I wrote folks um it's a good thing CNN wasn't blatantly complicit in the massive on forced air ward pulled yesterday that would have been really embarrassing oh\nWait a minute and I had below that Elizabeth Warren this is the CNN politics headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of native and Native American ancestry no strong evidence is in quotes\nBut that's ... that's hysterical right I mean this would be like this will be like running with the headline that says you know for somebody that was caught on video you know that that that is and it's already confessed the murder\nBe like a man accused of murder not guilty in quotes and they'd be like well it's that that's what his lawyer said okay but is that you're making an analytic judgment by pulling that out in the strong evidence\nIt's not strong it's garbage is not strong evidence no one could strong evidence they would never do this if it were Republican anyway so this year the attention of CNN vice president of communications all oh Matt ... never heard of this part of my life\nWho defended the network's coverage while accusing section of not actually reading the piece I read the piece but thanks that that's cute anyway\nMatt wrote to me see how strong evidence is in quotes that means it's a phrase attributed to someone other than the author it's almost like you didn't read the article or watch our coverage oh wait\nA okay well I did read the article and I did see your coverage because CNN is on the news room where I work all day long so yes I saw lots and lots of see it as coverage and it was [laughter] appalling stupid\nThough there is that uh the media outlets from there to fight to get an earth bucks X and responds to ...\nHa ha sure dude CNN coverage of war is DNA release was really top notch journalism and your headline wasn't clearly constructed to put a positive spin on a disastrous decision by likely Democrat twenty twenty candidate just own you're biased\nAnd he writes give me a break you didn't watch or read our coverage you're just shoveling S H on Twitter to score cheap points here six more headlines from CNN and the DNA tests I don't care if you criticize why's he but I have no time for trash bucks actually goes back\nThat's funny you're leaving out this gym of analysis by a reporter a quote reporter\nWho wrote in this piece Donald Trump never cared about Elizabeth Warren's DNA weight but that's a reporter\nShe's doing analysis though oh you mean opinion but no they called analysis but oh she's a reporter\nSo what's the difference there is no difference there just playing games and then I wrote to him CNN tried to run covered Warren and then got caught looking dumb your coverage than adjusted out of self preservation it's fine to be a DNC appendage just own it\nYup yup yup yup yup yup yup that was fun just take your spanking CNN just take your spanking\nAnd just go home All right don't don't try out after you got your little spanking and be like oh you show me your show me\nA good times good times she CNN is in fact often fake news and it is definitely part of the news and if they really want to try to have this fight and they want to know honest also noticed that the guy goes to ... this is what a quotas\nI'm smarter than you more on do you think I don't know what a
