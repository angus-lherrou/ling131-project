know sex and his phone call or have been back to me why because sometimes you can't go to hire\nArmed them they they ... some ... not the correct time\nI got to tell you it's amazing to me or I shouldn't say it's amazing it's noteworthy to me that the first lady of the United states who's an immigrant to this country a very successful legal immigrant to this a country\nThat the first lady age or has a better understanding really the first lady has a better understanding of rule of law due process and the presumption of innocence than about Ninety percent of the mainstream media\nShe's like yeah I stand with women but like show some evidence you know we we got to have we got to have evidence\nI Know people say oh but most of the time it's just an act it's just an accusation and well the truth is those accusations are generally anchored by the place the time the reality of whether those people had had any contact were they in the same region within the same city\nAre you know is there are there are allegations in their allegations\nYou know if I say that I met\nWith somebody who was part of some international conspiracy Thirty years ago I Can't tell you where or\nWhen but it happened that's a lot less convincing that last week I met with a guy named Bob who is part of some big international conspiracy we met you know next to the Washington Monument and this was the time of day\nBecause by adding those details even if I'm just making that allegation it at least provides a context and it makes it either provable or disapproval theoretically prove or disprove will whereas if it's on more by the time or place you can't\nYou can't just prove it that's why the Ford allegations and I vote that's at Ford was a very disturbed person I mean I think the lousy for probably has had\nAll kinds of terrible things happen to her I think she probably was a is almost certainly was sexually assaulted I just think almost certainly uh she is making up but it was Brett Kavanaugh or at least she's wrong about it being Brett Kavanaugh which would not be that strange for people with a thirty five year a memory gap\nSo or thirty five years ago and memory gaps in that\nShow here here we have this the first lady talking about the me too movement and and ... cents while talking about the me too movement and then we also have what does not make sense in this for me too movement or what what does take things far beyond\nThe realm of what any normal person or would would be willing to say or think about an issue Victoria ... shell brown got published in the Washington Post\nAnd that the Washington Post would publish this I mean they consider themselves a serious newspaper okay they they think of themselves as probably the second most serious newspaper the country only to the you know only in the the number two slot for the New York times\nBut there are deep sea bass and so I'm sure they believe that they're even better than the times on a whole bunch of issues anyway\nHer piece is as follows quote fame or this is a professor or a college professor riding the Washington Post thanks for not raping us all you good men but it's not enough\nLet me take you a little bit into this piece my friend's quote I yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell not how could you ignore that red light yell this was real yelling this was thirty minutes from the gut yelling\nTriggered by a small thoughtless dismissive annoyed patronizing comment\nReally small a microwave that triggered a hurricane I blew hard and fast and it terrified me\nI'm Still terrified by what I felt in what I said I'm almost Seventy years old I'm a grandmother ... in that roiling moments screaming at my husband is if you represented every clueless mail on the planet\nAnd I every angry woman up twenty Eighteen I announced that I hate all men and wish all men were dead one of my grandchildren yet you also think that ridiculous I'd have to stifle laugh but my husband uh fifty years did not laugh he took a dead seriously\nUh okay this is pretty much a an overview of contemporary left wing feminism on display fish more or less a lays out for all of us why feminists are are\nLiberal Schumer lists nasty angry and and destructive not just in the in the general conversations we have in society but really self destructive to\nThere is a bizarre self loading self pity ing and self righteousness at the heart of left wing feminism\nYour victims but you're also warriors for for justice you know social justice warriors are you are sanctimonious all the time but you really just want to\nHave people treat you better well you know ... which is it\nThis woman went into what I think you can call full on Harvey mode against her husband I think that's fair to say screaming at him more than she's ever screamed it'd be for over ... says where they thoughtless comment and she thought she was channeling the anger of all women and then a whole\nYou used by the way is about how it's not enough to just not attack it's not enough to just treat women well and not be a sexist you have to form a male pro feminist movement\nThis is classic progressive social justice theory I Would know they say there's about racism to it's not enough to just not be a racist personally you're responsible for historical racism has a white male and therefore you must actively work against it oh that means being a progressive doesn't it but\nI I really tell you to read this piece thank you for not raping us good men but it's not enough and get a real window into the mindset of these radical deeply unhappy deeply troubled so called feminist [noise]\nEvery day I start the same way with a delicious hot cup of black rifle coffee [noise]\nThis is so good my friends that I don't even need the ad in the ... and I'm actually a big no stranger but you know what else I drink a lot of coffee and I know delicious coffee when I ... I'm not into those left leaning Tommy corporate brand I mean the black rifle coughing\nEverybody listening this was a coffee drinker should go if you have not already to black rifle coffee dot com slash book you'll get Fifteen Percent off your first order and you can get absolutely delicious coffee whether you want to ground whoa bean or cake cup delivered to your door they even have a decaf option now\nIf you're so inclined black rifle coffee dot com slash buck Fifteen Percent off\nAnd the problem is what what do you see is the main opposition to this\nWork I think the main opposition to this\nIs people who um are are\nFundamentally has a tent and having the government stepped back in any way shape or form when it comes to have control over this process I think people think that if if you give the right to tie you have like oil salesman selling false hope\nYou will have people bankrupting themselves or you'll have people you know it's\nDoing a pharmaceutical companies are shards over this I don't think I have I think we've seen that in ... thirty eight states\nUm we haven't seen those kinds of things happened just yet I think the idea that you know selling false hope that somebody who we go into the hands of their life\nUm I mean the ... who are we to make that kind of paternalistic ... like if somebody wants to try and we shouldn't tell them that they can fight for a chap\nYou're absolutely right we're talking with David Barnes a from a generation opportunity he's the director of policy and it's about this right to try legislation and um later on I'm going to give you a link to a website by what the heck I'll give it to you know\nGo and act dot com go and act dot com\nAnd that'll give you the ability to link to your representative to Europe of folks to get the word out that you want them to vote in favor of this and it's of course it's the right to try legislation\nUm how we are about Massachusetts and Connecticut do they all ready allow this\nAt the Massachusetts does not like it does is it for thirty states across the country and that's it you know red states blue states\nYou know all different regions all different types of states uh I don't it's not really a partisan issue but all the states that has passed that law that says this first step so we really need Congress to that through the south and make that national decision let's just because a lot of the\nChallenges pharmaceutical companies now why did hospitalized with the FDA yeah because they know the FDA you know run their lives and and ... and there was is that if all of that they really want to get that national fan approval before her live for people\nI mean it makes sense to me and I would think that if say insurers insurance companies\nWere opposed to this they would have been lobbying a long time ago before all those thirty eight states adopted it because they're saying well we don't want the additional expense of this and we don't want the you know I mean this is much different bees are experimental drugs is isn't even\nBeing in a trial this is a drug that hasn't even made it to trial stage and it's only gone through\nThe the safety protocol which is okay is this substance safe to administer now let's determine whether or not it works it hasn't even gotten to the whether or not it workspace\nRight and you know the the ...\nTrial ... perspective is very important for your talking a very small amount of you know randomly selected people\nAnd so is the FDA can't monitor it high of a hundred thousand people that just the scientifically unwieldy but they're like the hundred thousand people who want to try new medication we\nThere's had hundreds of thousands of people died from cancer or other you know various offices here early\nDo we really like all of them are just happy to sit and wait for your\nYeah it it is a great it is a great thing um so uh one more time we're talking with David Barnes from a general opportunity he's the director of policy this is a right to try legislation and it basically means\nWhen all else has exhausted a cancer patient isn't in a trial there is a drug that's in the pipeline but it's way way way down the pipeline only as ... reached the first hurdle which is is it safe\nAnd um they want to allow people and their doctors to be able to make a decision is that yeah there's there's no other ... uh no other options right now other than trying this I mean the bottom line is isn't isn't it about hope David\nExactly I mean it's about\nYou know telling people that if they want to if if they think that there's a way to save their lives as they should be allowed to say that and not in a way\nI mean imagine you know I mean he said if you think they're way down the ... and what if they're not what it felt like eight months away you know that goes to six months I should say like\nWell you know hope hope that will do it faster than we couldn't before\nWhere he had the opportunity to take that chance\nUh we live as a free country people should be able to uh take medication that they think their doctors that go save their lives for not for the drug company to pay for it or you know for free for the insurance companies pay for it and just saying let's give the people that\nLook folks you heard it and uh I Know you know someone who either could have been helped by this um could be helped right now or maybe somebody in the future or could be helped by this oh the website is go and act\nDot com go and act dot com it'll give you information on how to get\nTo your legislator how to get the word out that you support this you want this to happen now if you want to learn more about this too you can also go to write to try dot org right to try\nBut to go to go and act dot com and\nGet in there and make it known that you feel that way because as soon as this interview was over I'm going to do it during a commercial and let them know that I feel the same way\nAnd a day but I really appreciate the time this has been very helpful I think it's a great initiative and uh I Hope that soon where a talking again and this is passed and then you're moving on to some other great cause\nRight very much ... than it it just needs to get on the house for that than men like how many things in this\nDay and age yeah All right well to get other than like a post office naming this is a big deal I think there's a good as it gets has like\nDavid thank you very much like that to me\nThere's a study out there that says um where addicted to our cell phones well actually let me clarify that and and I won't speak on behalf of the study of bringing an expert for that\nBut there are researchers in South Korea who have shown that the teams using smartphones are are triggering brain chemicals and brain reactions similar\nTo those of addicts let's get someone on here to ah to go through this who knows what they're talking about uh she is the founder of the brain performance center in Dallas and a specialist in brain held a welcome Lee Richardson thanks for joining us\nTo perhaps yeah this is a this is not surprising to me and and I'm not a scientist but I Know how I Am with my smartphone but this study says that um the\nDeer triggering some of the same areas of the brain that are active and addicts\nVery true and I was when I got from how clock brown whether I have found a book can weigh that conviction began brown or anything else when you talk about addiction what we think of all of them have centric alcohol or drugs\nI'm a book from home but it's kind of more into it

same way and that way that they register\nPray it that pressure if I really don't know trans narrative for me\n[noise] this is this is incredible I mean we have ... you're absolutely right we have\nBegun to understand that addiction is is a ... not necessarily always about a chemical that can be about an activity as you said gambling sex addicts so now\nA point where they're constantly

eighty Ninety nine at the end of the\nBusiness on line with higher dot com\nAnd what's the definition of rich\nWell actually they break it down state to state that's right a Business Insider has done it with some folks from the U.S government and you'll be surprised what the numbers say about each state and what it takes to be considered\nRich joining me now is someone who can sort all this out for a Caesar private wildly advisor Derek Kenny good morning Derrick\nGood morning great to be with you and nice to be with you too okay so let me see\nThe U.S government defines a wealthy individual is someone who earns at least five hundred thousand dollars and a a couple that has the could drawing income of six hundred thousand dollars so but then it varies state to state right\nIt definitely does and it's interesting as a financial advisor I'm often out there how much money do I need them make truly be rich or is it where you live in Massachusetts the wall of immediate income average income as eighty two thousand dollars\nTo be rich and Massachusetts you need to be bringing in five hundred thirty nine thousand dollars while I get different parts of the country it sounds like a lot but enough with the California\nGOP not it doesn't go as far as many people think it does when it comes to how to read and it's just the cost of raising a family and their state income tax other expenses that could get eaten up very fast\nWhile but that's to be considered Canada rich in of course that income would have to be sustained not one year a windfall but you'd have to make five hundred thousand a year or Massachusetts five hundred thirty nine thousand a year to be consistent\n[noise] that's right and the key there is not just consistent earning\nTake him out one step further to consistently have in the Dallas texas area we have the same down here that we use a lot colder that person is big hat no paddle and what that means is there's often clip on nice to have the big house in the car and they got the look that they're rich\nBut upon further questioning you realize they're living on almost everything they're making so a person making one hundred thousand is the same as a half a million dollars\nBut they're just not making any more saving dollar so the key is how much are capturing yeah all of that income to really say that and put toward long term retirement and your other goals that you may have\nWe're talking with a dirt Kenny who's a a private well to invest are about to say you know these numbers what does it mean to be a rich and what do you have to earn in a particular city and uh\nIt's it's interesting as you go throughout it um but you know you have to factor in all those things like housing up here in the northeast is very expensive compared to other parts of the country\nWell it is now a huge thing to think about let me give you an example we had an executive here in Dallas that was recruited to grow up to Boston to work for a company and uh the offer him a really good and I said look how much are they going to be have to be who he\nWould make me now I'm In town here and like the American idol he'd probably ... to maybe seven to keep up with the cost of living there things cost more than he was glad that we share that with him because he thought he thought the opportunity to look great but didn't realize that he made ... cause\nWith how much and they caught the May Day the same standard of\nLiving you know yeah and I'm sure you're familiar with the taxes we have a peer to versus Texas\nYeah all of those are big big areas are now what people really winning let us know where to move\nFrom Massachusetts and let's say they moved to Dallas and they moved to somewhere in the Centre part of the country where no one can take all the game from their house\nPut them into a house here so I'm quite a bit of money left over it sort of have a higher like catch up strategy and what I was telling your liquor is what I tell my clients and that look there's really no way is to become rich and they they're very simple but you have to come out of work into it one if you have a lot more\nThe reality is if you want to have lots and lots of energy and stamina I'm healthy exercise and healthy diet or the way to do it but guess what they're not a quick fix and they require constant work\nUm if you train your brain that that you can to delayed gratification to do the work um than that at a young age than you can live a healthy lifestyle but if you train your brain as a young age that you must have a quick they're\nAnd they're constantly thinking a quick fix\n'em you're setting yourself up for a lifetime of disappointment\nDr John ... been ah origins recovery center addiction specialist about kids snorting cocoa doctors thank you very much appreciate the time you bet thank you\nHey there's more job openings out there but we're not getting an increase in our wages this is a\nThis is according to bank re a bank re dot com study showed that over the past year more than half of American employees did not experience any wage increase now how is this possible ... research says that we've got what four four percent\nUnemployment that's kind of like full employment when I went to school well let's not rely on my opinion was trying to work all this out with a dairy Kenny weapons to be a private wells advisor he understands smart things like wages and unemployment and everything else good morning Derrick\nGood morning great to be with you I I certainly try to understand them a silly your point is a good one why aren't people getting paid more money if companies are doing so well\nAnd the problem is if your stock holder you love this because you love the fact that company is cutting costs they're reducing extensive the problem is that payroll for people tend to be one of the largest expenses that these companies and maps what tends to get squeezed the most\nYou know for example some of the research showed that fifty four percent of workers didn't receive a salary increase in the past twelve month\nIn so many people while they may feel like the economy is booming their personal economy may be shrinking\nYeah the um the consumer price index is um increase to point to present in the past year and being in September and uh so a lot of people feel like wait a minute this is backward progress at the same\nThe the same people are saying isn't the economy booming\nThat's right and so what's\nHappening here and they're sort of a dichotomy occurring so\nReally what employees are faced with is what they wanted you to change this because\nRight now there's many people that are lining up to take the jobs that people that if they were to leave there's other people could fill those there's almost full employment right now so I have a car and come in the office last week and he was asking you could there why aren't getting paid more money here's my skills and so forth and so when I had to have what I\nSaid look you've got a choice to make it you can set it out and wait for that next raise which in this case may be a year or two years from now that married raised when your evaluation comes up or you could do something out of the box and he looked\nAt me eyes wide open I said look what if you did this what if you went through your boss or your supervisor and said look I Love working here love working for you but I Want to do better here what can I Do to help you and the company reach their goal and in\nTurn I could receive a piece of that based on my increased productivity and my focus on your goals and he said there you really think they would respond and so it doesn't hurt to try right as\nLong as you know well so he did that he called me back a few days later look there I was surprised when really really well we woke up a game plan of\nWhat I Am now on track to receive a raise if the company that certain things and so the bottom line was because he said something and put himself on the radar he then became more valuable to the team and to his boss here's somebody who wants to play in the big leagues and willing to take some risk to have that conversation\nWe're talking with a Derek guinea a private wells advisor about this this sense that there's a ... unemployment and people their soap employment in the economy the economy's booming but people aren't getting raises and uh as dark just said one of the explanations is it's the largest expense and the company and\nYou can pass it on to shareholders or why not the the other thing that I I Want to know if you think is working here is that even though we rate unemployment at four percent I remember during the Obama years you know it was we had low unemployment\nBut we also had the lowest number of people in the workforce in decades is it that the people who were completely out of the workforce\nAre coming back in and taking the jobs that are a part of the economy turning around\nThat is certainly part of it and keep in mind for people who may not like they're jobs there's an equal number of people who want those jobs that are willing\nTo take whatever is paid in so many people are content not rock the boat there look if I Am able to get a job I'm happy I'm not going to say anything or do my job and leave but really for those people that have a more entrepreneurial perspective and feel like they should get paid more deserve to get paid more\nThey've got to really take the bull by the horns and make themselves more marketable and that may include changing jobs right now employers are willing and have shown that they are ready to pay for people with skills that can pay the bills\nIf they can increase the bottom line for that may be one way to get a raise as well as look I Can't get to where I'm at right now but if I change jobs they might pay me for that value I could bring to the table\nIt seems to me you've got to be proactive because it's not just going to be supply and demand where you you have low unemployment and um so there's more you know the the employers have to be more competitive to get more people it appears that's just not happening you you've got to\nMake sure that you show the employer while you're valuable\nThat's exactly right the government will not provide a bailout package for your bad job situation that's uh that's\nJust the frankly way to put it in so people have to take the bull by the horns and realized look I've got to be the one to make changes either I can stay where I'm at which is a fine choice or I can choose to go to my boss and have that discussion or I could change jobs altogether and moved to a different company\nBut the bottom line and the question I Would encourage people to ask especially now because of the holidays are some reflected time\nAsk yourself if your city down a year from now thinking about the ideal your for your career\nWhat needs to have happen for you to do that and looking back over the year that means having that top discussion or making a change you may be better off in your family may be better off because you have the courage to make a joke that different than really make a change in your heart\nYeah Darren ... and just finally before I let you go do just maybe a circumstance where the company's not prepared to\nBe able to give you more because of the position they're in or they've been cutting you off for the past five years because the economy has been lousy and you still been producing for them I just don't you have to be prepared to walk\nYou have to be prepared to walk and that's what I Would encourage\nPeople to think about is what is it worth you know some people that tend to be low risk takers which are fine they tend to be more of a look I'm thankful to have the job and the first place\nAnd hang out I may complain a bit but I'm going to ride it out most of the clients I tend to work with and to be achievement oriented hide driven type people a personality isn't so we talk through what\nLet's take a drive and apply it to your career decisions not just what you do on the job and how do we best position you for success because a company out there a physician and well\nEven regardless of age even nowadays older employees and there'd be more valuable because they have ... experience they've gone through a lot of the ups and downs some of the younger folk habits so it's all how your position and sort of packet yourself\nYou have it done well you can actually position yourself and get a raise and and do pretty well in your career as well\nShe had Derek that's great sage advice Derek Kenny private wealth advisor Derek thanks so much\nAlways a pleasure thank you for having me\nThe Army National guard
