{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "And when you say this to people who don't care what a person's races don't judge them by their skin color and\nLove a lot of women in their lives and treat women with dignity all the time and are completely respectful to women they just started tuned out all the rest of it because it's cheap\nIt's dishonest at this as a line of attack against Trump and against everybody around him is just going for the lowest common denominator and its mudslinging and place of ideas mudslinging and in place of policy I I had I had to laugh at that one I don't even know was with companies like\nThey're kicking monks full of let's say liberal tears up and I'll just like like my parents right now are real like it's like why are they doing this to me\nI Wish that they would also get a little bit more of a sense of humor a sense of humor that didn't revolve around mocking and ridiculing are Christians and a white males all the time\nI mean white males we can take it I mean the stuff about Christians that they do is particularly a nasty you know that's really it's not meant to be laughing with its laughing at all the time\nBut liberals don't have a sense of humor anymore and this is why you see these polls about political correctness and how anybody was paying attention to it was a political correctness is a cancer in our society\nIt is destructive it doesn't add anything to society doesn't make us better as as people it just creates a incentives to make politics all about personal destruction and also allows some of the most\nAnnoying stone faced on happy miserable petty people in our society to get to write and then rewrite rules that all the rest of us have to live all the time I've said it before it's really important Trump got a lot\nOf support in the early days because he just said political correctness is garbage he just said it's garbage she didn't say oh you know we shouldn't be so politically correct but I understand why people are coming from it no no no it's garbage and it is\nSo destructive to society so destructive to uh our ability to talk to each other as normal people have normal conversation\nI get frustrated I city or I Do the show there's so many times where I think that's a joke that I could make it'll it'll run through my mind as I can make that joke and Ninety nine percent of\nThe people listening a view the wonderful people listen to this show who do really mean so much to me every day Ninety nine percent of you will be like oh that's really funny or maybe maybe even you know Ninety percent of you would think it was funny nine percent of you would think man wasn't that great\nAnd then one percent though of the lives listening or one percent of the people that includes media matters in some of the other\nManiacs that listen to this show or they would have a problem with it and they would take it and try to twist it and use it as a weapon against me and it's just not worth the risk and\nIt's really hard to do any kind of comedy is really hard to ... because ... comedy entails risks right you're you're you're trying to push founded you're trying to I'm I'm not a comedian but I Do some funny stuff here and there\nAnd I certainly wish I could do even more amusing uh takes on commentary on politics and I do but it's I just know that you know you you run up against this\nAh this third rail that's a mobile third rail I that they it's not like it stays in one place you don't know how close you are getting to it because they'll change the rules and they'll change what's going on around you based upon their ability to get ya when they want when they want to get you\n... it's just that so inspiring going back to the\nThe way that they're using these calls of racism and massaging these allegations as really a primary a primary means to get people to go out and vote for Democrats that's the best they can to\nYou know I I they're they're talking about health care a little bit and basically Trump is a racist in terms of ... and all these other things you know they they also seem to forget that we haven't forgotten\nThat Bill Clinton\nHey ladies haven't seen a little while as wants to come over who wants to take a selfie with me\nJust watch words out of hand goes you know I just don't know it's got a mind of its own you know Bill Clinton's out there as somebody who is still very respected Democrats circles in fact Hillary went out and said recently there was no power imbalance but the president of United States she sent us an interview\nWas it a week ago there was no no no power imbalance between the ... the United states and ... injured in the White House that he was having a\nRelations relations with um she still she still will say stuff like that and of course she thinks she's still running for president which is [noise] it should give us all a nightmare as how long but it really should be the stuff of a bad dreams but I think it it could become our reality before before too long\nThis is the thing though there there's a there's a joy listen is at the heart of of the Democrat\nPolitical ideology these days it's all about\nMaking sure that no one you know that there used to be the sole I forget who it is or who said it I Want to say it's men can but it might not be Jamaican but you know a a puritan is somebody who lives with a constant fear that someone somewhere might be having a good time\nAnd you find that increasingly tree of Democrats you know a a Democrat is somebody who's constantly and fear of someone somewhere saying anything interesting radical new different you know breaking down old paradigms and\nEnjoying themselves while they do it you know enjoying themselves while they try to challenge the dominant political orthodoxy Democrats get terrified by that they show\nDesire conformity and discussions all the time in fact they desire telling you what words you can use in the discussion and and who can eat and who can use what kinds of words so many constraints put on this all always I mean I just\nIt would be easy for me to switch you know in in my head if I wanted to and and become a Democrat just call everybody every conservative everyone the other side is racist all the time everything is sexism everything is intersection analogy it's just exhausting though isn't it to think that way\nYou you think about what it really must be like to be some of these\nAre just joyous radical feminist that I've seen recently and had to talk to a few times\nIn the last few months because the whole cabinet situation who really do think of women as this terribly oppressed and marginalized minority in society you know they're actually my ... majority by population\nThat they really think of themselves this way and there's a constant chip on the shoulder attitude for all their interactions with men always\nIt's just not a good way to go through life it's just not a a\nHealthy way to be an increasingly I think for Democrats you know it's a it's like a sugar high politically you know oh you got to do all the virtues stigma\nAnd you get to feel like you're so brave and tall on issues where you're taking what is the most convenient issue for you politically socially and professionally\nAs a Democrat but he had days isn't it just\nDoesn't feel kind of hollowed and never have to really engage the other side and just called and racist and massaging is I don't know how people think about this as they go and and they vote or whether they're going to vote or not definitely worth spending some time\n[noise] I've got some of my hand right now [noise]\nBlack rifle coffee\nIt's like having a warm cup of freedom that keeps you energize and ready to fight the fights that mattered\nBlack rival coffee is delicious I mean I'm kind of a fruit fruit\nBourgeois city guy when it comes to my coffee can I really do care where the beans come from how they've been roasted in how they taste\nBlack rifle coffee gives you all of that and it's also a company that is owned and operated by veterans including many members of us special operations have gone out now in the world to create a fantastic brand that's all about patriotism veterans and freedom\nOh I have no idea what day it is maybe because of that fact and maybe because it was a Tuesday in a way that right and that's the whole thing like a ... and and and that's the\nPoint you know right that the point\nI'm a govern Red Sox headed to the world series Red Sox\nHead into the world series and it's time listen you're going to throw out a mothballs today because people like me are going to get our fair weather fan outfits out of the closet you know like ah my big Papi shirt how about my ... shirt that doesn't fit any more\n'cause it's thirty four years old\nHow about that one as that one man to so good so they did\nThe impossible not that it's like the impossible dream of uh what was it sixty seven the impossible dream team but they did the impossible and Danny was you know during the five o'clock hour when we were just on and central mess explaining\nIt and he said hey this exceeded expectations and the and that's it seem\nYour run of the ones saying they're not going to make it to the world series\nUh pretty much yeah I have no problem rooting against the theme um ah I was just I'm Amazed at how well\nThey're pitching was I mean I remember saying couple days ago they got us our five five or more runs against everybody if they're going to win and a lot of times they had to do that but ah they know it's really like all coming\nTogether I hate when they say the teams of destiny but I mean when they need a big hit they get a big hit when they're big catching the outfield they gotta catch in the outfield and they need a big strike out they got to make strike out and uh\nWhen they fan interference they get fan and\nIf you're an interference in um it's funny even though they said going into today's game a I'm Sorry into last night's game they sort of\nThe red Sox had this approach of like well if we when we when we lose we lose right because we're up three to one in the series were still playing down in Houston if we lose this game whatever we go back to Fenway Park we got two more cracks data yeah up three to two in the theories and so last night was I don't want to call it a throwaway game it never is in the play offs but they they would have accepted a loss and yet they went out there\nAnd got great pitching from a a guy who is just stunk his entire career in the playoffs\nFinally came out of a shell and pitch great they got the wind\nAnd uh I think expectations changed now because they are much better than either the teams in the national league\nAnd uh they should or should be World Series or bus right now for the red Sox down there we go\nNow what do we find it would it be fun Jim is if the Dodgers win and then you get all these guys from LA coming out here where it's going to be you know forty nine degrees and you know\nRaw and you know we didn't have any you know what Danny and I didn't even think of that because I was asking him earlier who do you want Milwaukee you know or do you want to LA and uh we never even took that into consideration the fact that they would have to go to a ball park\nWhere you can't have sushi in the stands right they would have ... they were that they would have to sit here and in a in a rickety old park which\nHas a lot of tradition and has a very uncomfortable seats and not have to eat 'em well meat byproducts out well but that I can natural casing Frank [laughter] meet by products\nNo sushi you know crab and ... and bananas no nothing like that nothing\nNothing like that at all that would be great and you know the Hollywood types would be out here\nUh Larry David would be here but then again Larry David spends a lot of time in New York too so it wouldn't bother him to be at Fenway but he\nI think most of the celebrities their bodies are are pretty much made out of rubber and latex now anyway they ask them and feel a cold\nThat is true now that I you're right you're absolutely right there in the ... and the women are are majority latex so folks get ready for the faint of a fair weather fan barrage what else is going on today night\nLast night Donald Trump was in Montana and he talked about a congressional candidate out there who you may remember kind of body slammed a reporter during his um campaign\nAnd he got in trouble for it and it took a lot of heat\nAnd you know Trump I Would say this is one of the moments I Would say the Trump that's kind of a stupid thing to say 'cause we just had a journalist the Washington Post journalist killed by the Saudis she'll be a stupid thing to say\nAnd and all of the press will jump on that today right\nAll of the press will jump on that today but we'll jump on what Nancy Pelosi said again Democrats inciting violence inciting the mob even Nancy Pelosi speaking of being made of plastic\nHope that we have for for ... for ... for a\n'til April thoughtful above a code word for every ... control um before some collateral damage to health care as well her ... than the average of ...\nWhat do you mean by collateral damage collateral damage what what is what this Eric Holder kick them when they go low we kick them\nGet in their faces Hillary Clinton don't be civil until we when the elections\nI mean what is this\nYour going to hear all about Donald Trump making that one comment which I Would not have made and again people know how I feel about Trump\nI like his substance not his style sometimes he should shut his mouth there's other times that I Love\nThat that he is quote unquote on presidential\nBecause he he doesn't let the ... the shows that Democrats and the left I'm not intimidated by you know I'm not intimidated by what you used to do all the time to get Republicans to cower\n... Nancy Pelosi\nComing out and saying well if this collateral damage against Americans who don't share our views [noise] do you hear that\nYou know the who wrote a song about uh meet the old boss meet the new boss same as the old boss\nThat that's a that's revolutionary\nThat's socialism and communism take it to the streets that's also and yeah I'm going to say if how the Nazis did it that's\nHow Mussolini did it\nI mean come on and\nI always friday morning the red Sox are going to the world series and I think that's great\nBut we've got some people who are pretty unhinged\nAny yet you're not going to hear about it\nOh one other thing\nUm you minister Louis\nFarrakhan who was tight with Iraq Obama continues to be typed with Keith Ellison you know the the\nDeputy chair of the DNC who's accused of domestic violence\nHe's tight with him even though Alison ... that I said\nDid you hear what Louis Farrakhan set about Jewish people\nDid you hear what he called them\nAll right I'll play

manage that you can get your retirement plan\nKissing ... here in town of doubt or it can have rocky you buy a A R B wants\nTo buy homes you became a house\nIs that Chelsea Clinton yeah Chelsea Clinton tweeted out couldn't damning Farrah Khan anti Semitism but of course\nShe couldn't just tweet out and and condemn is anti Semitism she had to bring a\nTrump into it too she had to bring Trump into it too she had to say in her tweet that she thought what he said was wrong and everybody should speak out against it\nJust like we speak out against Trump when he says something like that she's equating Trump with Farrakhan and her father sat there next to\n\nSara ... at the funeral oh by the way so when people call there are out\nUm she tweeted out\nI've heard this a lot today almost a drumbeat a few thoughts of reads his family at every right to invite whomever they wanted to celebrate her life as I've said before ... anti Semitism is wrong bigotry is always Ron I'm not my parents

world series and despite the cold this morning it being around freezing or just below freezing where you are\nThe boys of summer [noise]\n\nWhere Harry Carey when you meet him\nCome on you know Harry Carey Mulligan that\nRed socks though let's hear\nDanny on board let's get Steve on board because we've got a lot of politics and a lot of other stuff to discuss plus it's freestyle friday you make the call you pick the topic it's all you have five five four zero three Ninety eight forty sixty and Danny like a lot of other\nSports pundits said ma and uh that I can make it and lo and behold\nHere they are a gentleman Danny happy that you were\nWrong about this obviously I think everyone's happy that the red Sox won it's a bit unexpected I think many people thought going into the series used there was a better team but\nThe red Sox I played them for it to five games so it's good for them and they're a rookie coach or pitching staff it's kind of thrown together in into the world series they go\nInto the world series and go Steve for any who's back\nFrom from a couple of days of seeing fish and that's to shoot the ph dude\nThat's where I baby that you've ever had really fantastic ...\nThese guys recognize you now when you go to sea fish do they like\nNow none of morning though I'm shocked at how many people are like this is my five orders show I'm like you need a job yeah right\nYeah I get like the folks I used to follow the dead exactly the same\nThreat right um I Do actually it's funny my time to perfectly last thanks I went to bed about eight and the first pitch was eight Penn and then I woke up at eleven forty five to turn on the TV for the last four pictures of the game and ice there although in fact they said hey which\nI I got a four and a half hour baseball games are just a ... this is going to be a grind especially if I'm you know if the weather's going to be as it is here in Boston and you get the ah LA Dodgers coming to town for a half hour game at a forty one degrees and and raw good luck\nIt's not ... it's not just the LA Dodgers right Danny it's the Elway fans coming out here and saying\nWho is the sushi stand how come you can't get sushi Fenway\nYes I think the I mean they've had been played this last series in Milwaukee has been exactly warm in Milwaukee this week\nOr so we've at least had the then able to do that so far yeah the fans however that come up to the world series I've just seen the thing standing room only tickets going for a hundred and eighty dollars a piece at Fenway Fenway Park than to go stand there and forty degree weather free eighty dollars and freeze\nThen freeze yeah but to be there for a game I'm a ... it's exciting and I mean it's great the perspective here is the patriots are off to a great season now and we've got the red Sox so a real fair weather fans I mean I think are just kind of have to suck it up\nAnd watch for and a half hours of baseball just have to and it's going to be you know what it's painful for us because we've got to watch it now and we got to get up and do the show that said the afternoon guys have it easy\nYeah a lot of the world series games they'll start to later either they're actually in the west coast games that you might not start to really\nI mean the the the ... what nine o'clock if it's an LA gay company nine eight seven six yeah yeah we started at nine o'clock will be getting up and watch the final pitches right will be getting up to go to work then there'll be throwing the final pitch is on the west coast\nOkay I'm I'm In for John next week so I'll be up extra early actually but some of the game while I'm prepping that's gonna hurt ballet I Will say to people like John that everybody else who just hates Boston sports I just I Want to just say\n[laughter] I Know Danny what was that forty ONE Championship appearances an Eighteen ... magic that from Boston teams [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell you heard Tommy bees are big Yankee's fan and he doesn't care he's happy about it but some people just not new a New York post first thing I turn to when I found out that the red Sox had one and the New York post what's the hold on a second let me just read let me just read the headline\nBecause we've got so much other news to do it Yankees fans only can watch as the greatest rival dominates again [laughter]\nI Love it I'm On a ... of it All right let's get to let's get to recreational pot here\nA few issues on recreational pot in the commonwealth now we're being told that the recreational pot stores are going to be open by Halloween is that is that trick or treat Danny how can they get this fall in line by the end of the month it\nSupposedly they found to testing facilities yesterday uh now they would have to be an open said facilities testy marijuana and they sold in ... eleven days I don't yeah\nSteve a when you saw fish did you notice that there's a shortage of um marijuana out there\nYeah it seems to me like the uh the the black market and the underground or area has just been totally dried up\nAnd that's just a impossible for anybody to find themselves any sort of marijuana ever ... whatsoever your band was the interpretation I got yeah you're being sarcastic yes I Am it everywhere and the longer that they wait the more the prices keep dropping in the black market and the less money the ... the towns or or or the ...\nIt's actually going to get because because the recreational marijuana is that I still think is going to be cheaper\nMuch cheaper than the stuff you're going to buy legitimately think about it this way\nThink about the fact that\nThere are certain things that we can't manufacture in this country\nCheaper than the Chinese\nAnd the reason is\nWell in this country we have um we have a higher standard of living we have all these um environmental laws we have all these labor laws and everything else so the fact that you have to ship something here from China means nothing because he can make it over there so cheaply well compare that\nI mean like this is a pajama boy you know like the the the expression for millennials in the you know like this isn't this isn't a real man this is like a this is like the new\nUm millennial ah you know a metro sexual kind of\nNothing but joy and also other hey how's the weather down there 'cause we're freezing up here already were\nSworn I woke up was nine degrees [laughter] I agree that that's\nGoing to get up to like ... it's going to get up to forty five decree that anyway All right thanks body be safe\nDown there in Myrtle Beach John listening on the on the heart radio apple let's get Steve from shoes ... good morning Steve\nAre you doing I'm good thanks how's things in chew buried today\nAre um are you All right we are all of a house yeah I'm here then is that we rarely on it or you're you're faced with it when the house yeah both of them have to go through the\nWell yeah but it's been the real issue impeachment\nUh the center of the house ... you know basically use the grand jury does the indictment and then the trial was held in the Senate\nAnd Joe Biden interestingly enough said I don't I think it would be a mistake for Democrats to go after impeachment now he gave him solving out he said unless we see something in the report\nFrom Robert Mueller that leads us to think he said but there's really no case for impeachment right now and I know Democrats didn't want to hear that they're speaking of that Steve what was the last time you heard anything about the mole or report\n[noise] ah [laughter] yeah that's enough that's got to tell you something but no you want you want to keep\nThe house too because you don't see below sea and everybody else getting in the way and what's interesting is that there's still a chance that the Republicans hold on to the house you know I I Know we we got surveys out there this that and the other thing\nOr the Kavanaugh stuff\nElizabeth Warren the DNA Hillary Clinton with no with Monica Lewinsky was an adult that's not helping Democrats and a brother the coveted\nWhite suburban females it's certainly not helping with them and the damage think that they're going to be able to help them in the mid term you\nKnow what the funny thing is a master but as I hear your big liberal thing which I Know we are in off the ... I don't know everyone everyone I Know it must just be around Boston rarely\nMa like a well listen I'm ... and she was very you know that's it and of course that's where I live that ... that that's a town that leans conservative I'm southern Worcester county is turning red\nAnd when you look at the western mass met map other than these pockets there's a lot of red out there it's just not great enough numbers\nTo help with the behind the tofu curtain which is Ninety five and east into Boston and then of course in the pockets in Northampton in Amherst those are real uh there's a tofu curtain up that way too\nBut you move you move in a circle probably friends who are like minded and then again you are in an area where it is not take it for me who has spent time there and who's worked in a newsroom there oh no it's it's as blue is blue I can you come to a\nPoint I I Can't even for most Democrats from ...\nReally well by the way I have I have friends who are very I have friends who are liberal and we just do not discuss politics death I mean I I just don't\nAnd I can be friends with somebody who is liberal if you're one of those angry liberals then\nIt doesn't work out because as I said earlier where liberals want to put politics into everything\nThey'll put it into everything will be sitting there you know they get here let's try this bourbon or I don't know if I liked that because you know bourbon was that had to be made by slaves at one point and it's like forget it it's a drink you forget it you know\nBut yeah thank you Steve I'm right well that was like you to um\nI Want to get to Nancy Pelosi what she said about the wall and how she tried doing a insult President Trump's manhood I'm Sorry about the quality of this clip but she was that when she came here to Massachusetts to do fundraising\nShe stopped at the Kennedy School of government was asked about the Mexico wall [noise]\nFor a long\nTime\nIt happens to be a man who'd issue for the president now here let me make a comment about Nancy Pelosi and let me say it must be a chick thing right\nThere must be a chick thing\nYeah that must be a woman thing\nYeah that must be an old lady saying\nThat even if I said that or or hold on someone comparable the Nancy Pelosi okay Speaker Ryan said something about Nancy Pelosi\nAbout that yeah must be a chick thing\nYeah yeah see I'm you know uh uh the the wall thing is a man or thing you know because you man you know because of a of an insecurity with their you know they're mad\nAt me they want a big build walls beg walls\nHow about if I said yeah Nancy the reason you want to spend all the tax money is the same reason that you have a thousand pairs of shoes\nYou some woman who just can't get enough shoes how did that in a Speaker Paul Ryan said that it's okay it's okay it's only hate if Nancy says it takes eight\nFive five four zero three Ninety eight forty six we are going to get Jeff deal onto the show soon a Jeff deal and Elizabeth Warren up a big weekend I think they get to the debates coming up and I I Do want to talk to Jeff deal\nHere's what I Want you to keep an eye on what we will keep an eye on it would be if this was a bit more on DNA debacle is going to start to hurt her in Massachusetts and you know as Steve from shoes when he called said hey you know where are these people while they're there they're\n'cause she still has a double digit lead in the polls over Jeff deal but if you listen to the ... gonna be hurt by this DNA debacle even in this blue is the blue states\nWe're going to start to see it in polling and we'll know\nIf he's in a good position Jeff deal if we start does the Republican National committee money come in remember I told you in this very studio I remember sitting across from\nScott Brown became hearing his green pickup truck I'm not kidding in a regular guy and I'm like I knew who Scott Brown was and I know is why she was very nice woman worked in Boston news I said yeah\nThis guy that I Know he's really got a chance you know we're all a little bit resigned to Martha Coakley becoming a senator but then the numbers just started to he worked his ass off in that green truck and the numbers started to show wow\nAnd then the Republican National committee started paying attention instead of ignoring Massachusetts and saying we're not going to win a Senate seat in Massachusetts all of a sudden it was\nHey we could win a Senate seat in Massachusetts and then the money started pouring in that's the way you can tell\nThat so that's how we'll be able to tell don't but I mean the polling you may be but the real folks have to watch or the Republican National committee they start pouring money into Massachusetts that means okay there's a chance here they don't throw good money after bad\nAnd we'll see if there is a we'll see if there's a cabinet bump for him but we'll also see if there's an Indian DNA bumper him you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe
