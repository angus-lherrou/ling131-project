Collins after a lengthy floor speech concludes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nNothing his victories were in the courts\nAnd through executive order that was it that was in I mean\nHe may have been a popularly elected president but when it came to his agenda\nWhat did he get done\nIn a lasting way\nNothing other than Obamacare and that was done on a procedural trick it was we all know was\nWhat did he get done\nNothing the liberal agenda the less the gender does not stand up to voters why\nBecause the average voter says on some of the crazy stuff they come up with that doesn't make any sense to me that's not the people are hateful and\nRacist it's just people say a lot of liberal stuff they say that doesn't make any sense I'm not going to go with that\nSure there are enclaves throughout the country where one of them we got the tofu courting around a north Hampton and cameras in that area and of course in one twenty\nEight east got the tofu curtain\nOn the rest of the state and get people saying that doesn't make any sense to me I don't get that\nThat's the problem now next step\nAnd we're going to get to build them for our national correspondent who will lay out just where we're going to be over the next forty eight hours how it's going to work\nBut Justice John Paul Stevens who's Ninety eight years old and I knew until I read this last night I didn't realize he was Ninety eight I knew you were retired I knew he was old but Ninety eight years old\nHe had supported Brett Kavanaugh previously he'd actually I think he had mentioned Brett Kavanaugh on one of his books talking about a decision\nThat came out of the D.C court of appeals the cabinet authored and said this guy would be great for the Supreme Court now John Paul Stevens is saying\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be a member of the Supreme Court really Okay John ... let me ask you this question let's take you\nDuring your confirmation hearing\nAnd subject due\nTo what Brett Kavanaugh\nHad to put up with\nWhat subject to you to what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with\nAnd see how you react\nI don't think that has anything to do with your temperament he's got three hundred decisions and how could you say that his three hundred decisions were sounding good and this guy should be on the Supreme Court then you see I'm Upset because his name was dragged\nThrough the mud how could you\nSay he doesn't have the temperament I Would say that if he didn't react that way\nNow granted he went a little overboard and himself in the wall Street Journal piece yesterday said I got a little too emotional\nOkay we've got a little too emotional\nNobody ever said that about any of his uh decisions did you see any one earlier\nThrough the process of his confirmation until they try to sneak listen\nThis is this a sex assault allegation did anybody say a you're a little too emotional anew rulings you remember hearing that during the during the hearings no you don't because it didn't happen\nBut John Paul Stevens said last I don't think he has let's put you up against it and see how you react not not as a Ninety eight year old man but when you were younger let's see how you react to it which brings me to another point the media\nNBC has has published\nAnonymous accusations against Brett Kavanaugh like like\nNo no verification no core operation nothing\nAnd yet NBC was the same network\nThat wouldn't publish Ronan Farrow Z story on Harvey Weinstein 'cause they didn't think it was corroborated enough think about it folks this is the biggest pile of hypocrisy\nI Hope that we ever have to see\nJoining us now\nMr former voice of the Miami Dolphins bills him for a national correspondent good morning bill\n... Jim how are you good thanks did you watch the game last night bill come on out\nThere they're always way too late for me so I kind of a I guess check out the highlights the following morning\nOkay and his eyes scam I'm I knew who was going to win so who\nYou know what is people down in Miami right now listening on the radio when they're not\nSaying this is Bill Bill used to do the games were talking about well we'll let it slide bill but you know what I Need from you Bill is the is the timeline now now that the clock is ticking\nNow that Mitch McConnell said they were going to be the votes yeah we got one vote today and one vote tomorrow possibly Sunday because somebody's going to be out in Montana what's ... what's the timeline bill\nYeah it today they're going to hold a procedural vote which is just basically to say okay let's let's get down to the nitty gritty here and move on to a full vote so that takes place today and it you know that'll go through without a problem but it just you know if a senator vote yes today doesn't necessarily mean they're going to vote yes\nUh tomorrow or or over the weekend because\nUh all they're saying today as let's go let's move on to the full vote so we'll get through this today so you move on to this full vote it is expected tomorrow however it may not be completed for some time because as you mentioned a steam Danes the Republican senator from Montana is going home for his daughter's wedding\nAnd good for him so yeah I mean I'm\nA yeah a although this may be the most important vote\nHe ever make some of the century for a Republican but I Do\nA ... but he has said that he will vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh as needed so uh I I think that he wants them to hold the votes open when you have said they have done in the past until he can get back\nAnd cast his vote you know there will be some hollering and complaining about that if Mitch McConnell does that as well yeah uh but uh it appears that he will be able to get his vote and he says he has to go this weekend to walk his daughter down the aisle\nAnd to get a new Supreme Court justice seated so they all an on both of those things are I think the real outrageous not bad uh his daughter scheduled a wedding that coincided\nWith a with a Supreme Court nomination bought that she scheduled during football season [noise] [laughter]\nI Love the I mean that should have been ruled out right from the very beginning and I must admit though I I I'm kind of at a at a at risk here as well because I uh my my oldest son is getting married tomorrow so\nI don't know I've got ... for you yeah but that would be only if you're a college football fan well true although ... on day he's still got Sunday yeah yeah\nMean she didn't get married on Sunday he didn't get married on Sunday and who knew that there was going to be a vote we're talking with him for our national correspondent now bill the other side of this is the chaos and I know Monday morning at this time we will be talking about chaos on cats\nNo no I Would like to see him out I really would like to see 'em out but\nHillary I'm Hillary has only been out a little but John ah stay safe

past few decades where has the majority of it Ben advanced and been successful very simple\nDon't answer to the voters\nAnd let me give you an example\nA little liberal issue and I'm not making a statement either way on it but in order to get it through it had to be done in the courts\nIf he were brought a proposal to Congress to say let's legalize gay marriage what do you think would have happened\nThe liberal agenda must be advanced in the courts\nThe issue of abortion was advanced than the court\nAll of the other issues are advancing the courts\nIf the EPA wants to do something\nAnd someone sues them that goes to the courts\nThink about it Brock Obama other than Obamacare what does he have for a legacy\nNo I mean in terms of accomplishments that are lasting none they ... either executive orders are things that work themselves out in the courts but that's it\nThat's it nothing else\nNothing else that's why there's going to be chaos in Washington DC this weekend\nYou know I

independence against representative Angelo poop Well Don thank you very much for your call already said that the seven witnesses testified\nOr gave 'em game answered questions by the FBI and um\nFor a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's former Georgetown Prep classmates\nSaid\nDevil's triangle was\nWas it some kind of sick twisted [noise]\nThey said it was a drinking\nGame [noise] uh uh someone

the Supreme Court nominee\nI mean it's News I'm not being salacious within flatulence gas\nThat's what it is how about this have you ever heard of a pop up class or a pop up course the did you ever have a pop up course in college or Danny did you know never had man bono I've heard of the pop ups used or\nThat was mom and pops you're talking about mom and pops where they had the problem is I don't know like like a no no no like like um like for instance Metallica had like a pop up store in the middle of New York city\nJust popped up and sold a bunch of merchandise Amazon does that would be walking around now of\nCourse we're all of a sudden in the middle of the semester they say hey if you want to get one college credit you need to do this\nAnd uh and\nAnd they happen now I guess well I'm up in Portland Maine State University\nWhich is funded through tax dollars me\nCollege offered a one credit course\nTo students willing to travel to Washington DC to protest US Senator Susan Collins as she ... her decision on U.S Supreme Court nominee\nBrett Kavanaugh you had to get on a bus Wednesday night and just go now\nFortunately\nThe president Glenn\nCummings said the pop pop pop up course\nWas offered without the knowledge of the school's provost\nAnd that the school won't be offering credit or paying for a bus to of student protesters there was going to Washington um can I ask this question and that's why it's interesting a beneficial from the main Republican Party\nWants to know how we got to the point where it was going to be offered and until reporters started asking questions about\nIt um\nIt was in the works in going to happen\nWho did it you think ... a gentleman when do you think we'll get an answer to that question\nNot one that will ever be answered yeah do you need any more evidence to show that that\nColleges are places where they indoctrinate people like re education camps into a liberal mentality State University was going to pay for that I Would have a problem even with a private university paying for that because other than I'm\nVery few\nUniversities and colleges take federal\nTax money through grants and loans\nImagine that\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG men double duty ADHD Worcester and I argue radio station [noise]\nReconfirmation I'm rich Dennison Fox News and the undecided have announced their choice ended up here's judge Brett Kavanaugh will become a Supreme Court justice before the weekend is over it's going to\nBe fifty gays forty eight days one present and one ...\n\n\n[noise]\nDoes that sound like people capable of independence thought and and do what you're thinking now that was an isolated case no just few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too [laughter]\n\nWas [laughter]\n\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters and I think these lost boys and mostly last girls\nDon't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions and it really is\nFrustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you have in our will make I mean how do you find out how it'll don't I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh I Will be\nI Will be voting yes\nOn ... the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention signed to how to vote later today said\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight who just some magical day and again I I go\nBack to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly how this worked out\nSusan ... gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she gave a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady get fined for more than Thirty years\nWhy can only hope that the cabin uh\nI'm In days and it's where the press said has finally hit\nAgainst this backdrop sat T H ... vegetables senator to decide what the constitution said if I say consent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be\nLegal Armageddon for them so ah ah the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in her argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something here fused of doing something in this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence\nThan it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrince venison since relevant to the advice and consent function when any accusation step hired ... nominees otherwise six cents blurry rat\nI worry that part of its print sense and could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with the huge damage to the confirmation process\nMoving forward some of the allegations against Jackson cabinet illustrate why\n... percent in a sense is selling\nFor it I Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for but if the allegations that when he was a teenager jets cabinet Toronto multiple girls\nAnd use their week at a state that sound like a gang rape\nYou know once most amazing here\nIs that when you think about it the apple ... behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirm judge Kavanaugh and most importantly\nThe absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he the guy that brought us Stormy Daniels for maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that were debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a Ninety may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice she talked about this this wild delegation\nFish out last is alec gauge what's put forth without any credit supporting\nEvidence and simply parents at public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally totally without any credible evidence and certainly not even a preponderance of the evidence what a brilliant day if you got a thought about that about\nSusan Collins together thought about cabinet all you've thought about anything it's friday it's freestyle friday the phone lines are open\nAid for for nine hundred bucks a for for nine hundred bucks\nWhich is to eight to five I'm also trying to figure out what's the worst jingle ever the most annoying jingle my personal\nFavorite for the winner of the most annoying you hear it everywhere that the one with the\nKids [noise] you know and [noise] why any time\nYeah
