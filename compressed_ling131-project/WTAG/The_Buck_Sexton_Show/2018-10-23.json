Fox News President Trump rally Republicans in Houston, Texas in support of Senator Ted Cruz slamming democratic\nWith ... is not really that much our business or our problem\nUh we can give a diplomatic statement about it we can say this was terrible you should never have done this but we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone ah this was a crime\nCommitted on Turkish soil so we don't have any jurisdiction here to speak up it was also donate a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lot of people focused in on that but\nDo you still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show you know why is this the president's situation primarily to handle you know why is this something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action\nAnd we do we know the answer the answer is that it's because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff uh and he loves dictators here's Obama's former\nPublic relations propaganda jar from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be political ... is\nWhat we're seeing her Christmas is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist that we call them the enemy is enemy of the states and we're giving a green light not just to the Saudi regime\nBut to any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has to do with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that his sort of Romanoff phony a family\nUh and their families seem to be locked together Jared yeah it is and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... where are we met you oh my gosh I don't know why\nAnyway I don't want any lessons that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management of MSNBC I don't know why people listen to what I really don't know among one of the worst analysts on TV or a total I Believe it used to be a conservative and say whatever you have to say to try and be relevant at any point in time\nBut you you have there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the ... the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people uh I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where journalists are the enemy of the people\nStraight up is the north Korean\nMinistry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes\nIs North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing's true in Iran is doing a lot of countries just being a journalist did not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the\nSwamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington D. C. and they really think that there's a national they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is as you always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just horrifying to them\nWork with the sleeves again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... where they could get cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get you ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on her despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who's battling literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about\nCheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do it they don't care about this guy to show be they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nAnd the guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as sort of happened to him but the way they're talking about it but it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes an opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean in American conservative Lebanon attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less\nOutrage about this just the fact it is just the if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered him but they're you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the cause she'll be was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamist ... nobody he wouldn't\nDeny this if you were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean it should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double and his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside\nBecause they were going to try and say that he left in the day had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear him that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of entail\nAgency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is ride regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and they get very adept\nTo dealing with that threat but they also often operate and places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd but they've tried this with others now too you know Jon Ossoff as I mentioned Wendy Davis you know they\nAnd the whole Kennedy crew it that's all a construct the notion that the Kennedys are so exceptional and even they try to mold ...\nInto a an extension of the Kennedy lower some oh he's kind of like JFK because he's young and sort of answer the whole notion of of calling this guy based show by the way is just such a ... it's just such nonsense [laughter] really you know you're not Hispanic so why you would just\nHave this Hispanic nickname strikes me as very obvious that\nPeople will just call you base your really your your father you know Mr Mr O'Rourke with like I'm going to call my son\nThey too um strikes may maybe it's true I mean I maybe but it ... strikes me as a bit as a bit odd now I'm not want to make fun of people's names but I mean I'm not I didn't call myself you know\nWhen in G. U. E. Y. E. N. or something which is a fine name but it tends to be a name associate with Southeast Asia right I I didn't just adopt some name from another culture and be like yeah I'm basically a part of that culture might as well be\nIt's it's cultural appropriation debate I was doing but ... reporters and and the left\nOr the Democrats they're obsessed with this guy it's weird it's it's really in the realm of creepy\nAnd here is ... he was just one example of this I mean here's a reporter was supposed to be interviewing Beto O'Rourke and this is what she says to him during the interview played with not\nObvious strategies that I've seen a void in a in a modern campaign we just literally show off everywhere all the time for every one you can be without interruption in from the federal back much I Love your show you're thinking well you\nKnow it's just [laughter]\n\nDon't rock star amazing ... that's a reporter got the Mike and and the whole thing you know star really\nThat's what you say the the the guy that this is your interview subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter ... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left\nOr or even in the ... the quote mainstream media is down in the middle journalists the big lie but they still clinging to it and they ever gone somewhere with Trump from like wow you're you're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that did they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know what the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they\nThey buy into this mythology one's got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all\nI don't know what I mean\nI like the guy was okay looking and you know sounds okay and is is all saying things strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess\nThere's a and a myth a kind of mixing\nHere in their minds of that running a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and coups charisma thing that Obama had so it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama\nPolitically speaking pulled together um and\nI think that is how they view which uh I think that's kind of the way that cause they're obsessed with this guy\nAnd I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying I think it's true\nThey know he's going to lose you're gonna lose by double digits up until he could lose by by nine or ten points they think he's going to run for president\nThat they think that a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red\nStates and he can take on Trump and I'm here to tell you that Trump would [noise]\nCrush him so bad\n\nIt takes courage to face up to the like followed him or his Wall Street money ...\nIf you're worried shore or losing sleep about your money to do something about it into the financial before Saturday's lemon am on news radio five eighty and Ninety nine point nine at that age she does the wind would hire dot com [noise]\n\nAnd it was you know because when it comes to the place we're so far never saw [noise]\n\nFood seriously seriously but not\nNice cool I'm a prince choose princess we were gonna you know we must around with the parties so we're just picking up where we left off [laughter] [noise] but see she went to it now she told me earlier she wants to be from the pie from the piece that yeah the ... that's me the prince to be [noise] um the ... the sprints\nWhat did you ever had a contractor something snow but the I mean did you ask her if she wants to [noise] Mm [noise] well [noise] I guess not really\nOkay in case you didn't know that is a\nKind of public service announcement from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on its hands and Amnesty International\nThinks that people need to be told via fairy tale that there should be no uh no kissing women who are asleep this guy also this this it's a cartoon we played the audio from it he\nOut of like reaches like he's going to do a little group group thing a while this woman's passed out and you know this follows last week when you had Christian Bale who is a celebrity a talent or does not strike me as very bright\nShouldn't have a fine actors I guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know attractive youngest blonde female or I don't I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm not a thespian critic\nOr a critic of the attack\nA but she said that she's worried about what will happen to young women that see or people in general including her daughter I think she said with a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who escaped to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I pointed out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because they were talking about it which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a prince to kiss her she saved her life like kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we're talking about this\nBecause if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that your choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out to mouth resuscitation you know in in a fairy tale is really what we're talking about here but they ran with this they didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say I have an actress because there was another one I forget who another actress came out oh I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries\nOld stories that\nIs instill very basic one creative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality entailed so good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I promise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well\nBecause the handsome prince can kiss the girl in a coma or I can kissed this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it and you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you because you've already heard it but you know there's some very dark first of all there's a curse and there's some\nAs they make it very clear that there are some are kind of crude sexual humor in there as well and referring to the initial that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be in title ... bro the president there there's all the the patriarchy left wing stuff is there\nBut you know this is what the what the left doesn't yet grass\nIs that they lose on this stuff they lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs um and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole ... this whole story that broke today about how Trump is ah taking is telling the D O D J now um that they should this is this is the storyline at least\nA that transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration now that is such a loaded headline\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in today's political correct one

W E a G ... Ga Ga HD Worcester and I are ... radio station [noise]\nTo years ago the presidential race I have never seen a ferret [noise] like I see right now I think the Republicans are going to do very well\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts winds up so much\nThat they want a strong military they want for executives I Want to safety they want security we give that the Democrats do not have that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they give me I think we're going to do very very well in the rise yeah you're\nNot in Trump's right I think that we're going to pick up Senate seat something's going to be fifty five you heard it differs fifty five Republican Senate seats\nBy the by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet midterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I\nI think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans at the end of the day but Trump is incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well\nWhich is the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is them\nWhile Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness\nAnd it really is it is moms or jobs and Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing\nThey're okay is that they could be stronger on this but on health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and\nBecause of a couple of\nVery unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm\nAnd Obamacare is garbage and Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them\nYou know they are not effective messengers on health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue on the Senate side however\nTed Cruz versus a bet to own Rourke a no surprise\nHere Trump is going out there to Stanford Stanford Chad and I just thought the thought this was a nice moment in your play play quip twenty as Trump's on his way to Texas\nThat any more taxes go up and I had a very very nasty stuff it was\nIt was a very good at it and we\nGot together and then by the way very late in the gym have we last shot so far it's only a voice [laughter]\nAnd then ultimately what happened we bought it out\n[laughter] it was obvious\nAs we have worked together very closely I like um a lot I actually like I'm a lot of these are very loving people to do\nThat in fact right now I guess they said they never say that if I can make them go on for miles is over a hundred thousand\nIncredible the crowd all that's going to be agreeing Trump in Texas saying over a hundred thousand people have registered for this thing ah we've had some fun with the whole ... ... on this show tonight uh but keep in mind it it's just you\nIn another case study in the media malpractice and in the bias that's pushing so much of what they do every day I mean this guy beta ... never had a prayer and earn a chance but the media just cried short thirty eight million dollars oh they're going on and on this guy\nAll in on it and I just feel like you know it couldn't be any more obvious they have very little interest in the fact that there is a much closer than anticipated Senate race for the sheet the Franken seat up in Minnesota you know you'll notice that not a lot of people\nNot a lot of people in the media are are paying attention to the fact there is a single\nDigit lead right now for the Democrat in that\nIn that Senate race who's trying to a place to Frank and see your job you know the race where they think maybe they can get some big upset again Ted Cruz that gets all kinds of coverage by like Senator uh Gina Smith is the one I'm Talking about here so she's just barely hanging on up there

lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLike the ... brains clipped everything he said here as it is wrong\nIn in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's irrelevant because they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment can say get out your trespassing is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their rights by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of\nA of rights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump and I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right\nIf I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak and a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right\nBut at a restaurant no you don't have the right to go into a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than he has a right to go to a restaurant and play your you know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those the eighties and nineties [noise] [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you I\nRemember how cool you were a high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you know you want to big speakers then you were really cool I\nWas a little speakers were much more is that if we pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers book\nAnd and one of the speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the weaker all sound really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird\nBuddha Bar lounge music and and I just think that that's such an a to Z weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music in the ... that's a bold thing to do to inflict I don't ever bring a Bluetooth speaker with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy was late at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights and privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that somehow this is supposed to go\nAnd for the Philly brands thing I'd have to say that were given comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any honest political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me and increasingly set of last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president\nThat's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was jar\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the confronting people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of Tron trumped arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is the Russians du jour rushing pawn where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same and Saturday in Philly brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell and remember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested what you're saying they're idiots\nAnd people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no it is not it is not\nAnd uh I I just think that this is\nOne of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too and they are total moron okay they absolutely should not should not or be given any respect\nFor any you know an approval from any one I\nHeard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people so I'm getting over coal to my voice has been really shaky last week video of people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show when I'm sick 'cause I Love all of you so much and I can't I Can't skip a day and the freedom huh unless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where\nA but the people yelling at below sea they've done nothing to help their cause a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their cause I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you're doing the huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false black I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling people on the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those individuals who were banging on doors and yelling at below sea have done the far left a huge favor\nI just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business he's had businesses great we've got companies large and small coming to us for their background investigations and vetting\nAnd I know why that is both because global verification is a U.S based veteran owned and operated background investigation company wherever your needs are for your age are department or if you're going to be leasing out a property to somebody if you need to make sure the person you are trends acting business with\nOkay so you have to keep that in mind\nAnd the more that we find out that the Democrats don't have any solutions to less will listen to their oh I've got solutions talk solutions like what\nHow do they want to do with homelessness the answers they they don't want to clear the homeless off the street and tell them that you know ... and essentially enforce vigorously laws because that seems I mean right now you can't do that\nWell if we're going to create a system for keeping people off the street and we have places for them to go that are mentioned give them a safe place to sleep foods you eat and help to get back up on their feet\nWhich we do as a country that we do it better in some places than others but there are programs that exist for that purpose if we have those programs we should also be able to say hey you can't sleep and leave and poop industry\nBecause that's what they're doing and it's not good for the people that are living on the street it's not safe it's not sanitary but the the liberal mentality is\nThat they don't want to enforce the laws against the less fortunate because they want to use the less fortunate as a political party or they want to use the plight of people live on the street to say oh you know we need we need more funding we need more funding\nYou know look at the big mean Republicans with their tax breaks and nobody is homeless because of Republican tax break\nNobody is homeless because of Republican fat cats doing private equity restructuring or something people lose their jobs I mean I'm not saying it's all fine but you know they they take it to this point\nAnd and the other issue is when you look at a mental health as a factor in homelessness\nUm yes that's true but really what he means by mental health is is generally a addiction that's the primary\nOr the primary factor that you find with homeless population is all across the country putting aside this whole homeless by choice movement which is a new thing which is happening in this country as well people say oh ... too expensive I'm just going to choose to be homeless\nOut but you know I I Would I Would tell you that it's roughly Seventy to eighty percent of the homeless population is is the number that I Believe I've seen but don't quote me on it\nUm but it's a huge majority for sure of homeless population has either a drug problem a drinking problem or a serious mental health issue very severe schizophrenia or any number of\nDifferent diagnoses and that means these are people who need help [noise]\nAnd it is not helping them to leave them in the public square literally in the public square to engage in all kinds of [noise] you know human activity and bodily function and things that are unsafe and you know not the way that people should be living but that means you're gonna have to\nHave police in social workers and I'll just come once it got to come with me we're going to get you off the street we're going to help you you don't just leave them there to wallow in their film because that's what the ACLU says freedom is [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug that is that\nWhat is the greatest threat facing this country right now\nYou might think the currency at an unsustainable debt load you might think radical Islam or Chinese\nAggression Russian nuclear fallout I don't know any number of different things that could come to mind but Ocasio Cortez too soon to be a sitting US Senator and darling of the left has a very different idea about the single biggest most\nExistential threat to the United states here she is in her own words [noise]\n\n\nThat's right we're talking about Nazi Germany now there's better be very serious I assume she must be talking\nAbout what happens when China's economy surpasses our own and we have a country with a billion people that wants to be the preeminent global superpower or at least something incredibly serious that's really going to happen and be a real concern for us right [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWhat [noise]\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is revealing that radical truth no your not oh my gosh\nClimate change folks climate change\nAnd renewable energy I mean the but let's understand this the Bush for renewable energy is\nNot about economics it's not about\nMaking a more efficient energy source for businesses a renewable energy is nowhere near as efficient as a carbon based a fossil fuels right there there's just there's no comparison even still with some of the technological advances\nBut renewable energy is what we have to devote ourselves to as though it were an existential\nCrisis similar to what we faced in the second World War\nI don't know how liberals go through the day being quite so crazy and quite so bizarre but but they obviously do and there is very clearly\nA strain of contemporary liberalism that wants to believe in the extreme catastrophe scenario of global warming slash climate change last\nAnd and I'm really starting to recognize this\nAs a disease of the uh western mind in the industrialized world of of the twentieth and twenty first century\nThat because there has been an existential crisis for the individual as the individual has moved away from God and a sense of a divine purpose for being on this earth\nThe existential purpose that exists for these people is in fact the existential crisis they've created in their mind via climate change they need\nPurpose people you go through you know a ... a mass lows hierarchy mass love that's right here on the bucks X ensure we combine Pavlov with mouths low for mass laws but my lows hierarchy of needs if you were to take a quick look at it\nThat there are yes of course at the very top of it you have the need or ... or I should say the very bottom of it where your baseline\nA level of of what is most important to you know you you have a the physical and then you have security\nAnd then you have social and then you have ego and then self ... at the very top of that pyramid self ... in what comes after you have the other things self ... an ego for climate change loans are very much tied into each other\nThey exist to save the planet and they said and saving the planet is why they exist right it's a self reinforcing psychological loop that people that believe in is have it's a belief this is not\nScientific it is a belief and the fact that they have been wrong so many times and a wrong not just based on the predictions but wrong on their own day to day
