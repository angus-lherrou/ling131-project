married I have friends who are liberal and we just do not discuss politics I mean I I just don't and I can be friends with somebody whose liberal if you're one of those angry liberals then\nIt it it doesn't work out because as I said earlier where liberals want to put politics and to everything\nThey'll put it into everything will be sitting there you know they get here let's try this bourbon or I don't know if I like that because you know bourbon was that had to be made by slaves at one point and it's like forget it it's a drink you forget it you know but yeah thank you Steve\nI'm All right well that was right to you too um I Want to get to Nancy Pelosi what she said about the wall and how she tried doing up in ... president\nTrump's manhood I'm Sorry about the quality of this clip but she was that when she came here to Massachusetts to do fundraising\nShe stopped at the Kennedy School of government was asked\nAbout the Mexico wall [noise]\nFor a law\n[noise] [noise]\nIt happens to be a man who do issue for the president now here let me make a comment about Nancy Pelosi and let me say it must\nBe a chick thing right there must be a chick thing\nYeah that must be a woman thing\nYeah that must be an old lady saying\nThat if I said that\nOr or hold on someone comparable the Nancy Pelosi okay Speaker Ryan said something about Nancy Pelosi\nAbout that yeah must be a chick thing yeah yeah see I'm you know uh uh the the wall thing is a man would thing you know 'cause you ... and you know because of a of an insecurity with their you know they're mad\nAt me they want a big build walls rag walls\nHow about if I said yeah Nancy the reason you want to spend all the tax money is the same reason that you have a thousand pairs of shoes\nHere's some woman who just can't get enough shoes I did my did that in a Speaker Paul Ryan said that it's okay it's okay it's only hate\nIf Nancy says it takes eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six we are going to get Jeff deal onto the show soon a Jeff deal and Elizabeth Warren up a big weekend I think they get to the debates coming up and I I Do want to talk to Jeff deal\nHere's what I Want you to keep an eye on what we will keep an eye on it would be if this was a bit worn DNA debacle is going to start to hurt her in Massachusetts and you know as Steve from shoes when he called said hey you know where are these people while they're there they're\n'cause she still has a double digit lead in the polls over Jeff deal but it hasn't been warned is going to be hurt by this DNA debacle even in this blue is the blue states\nWe're going to start to see it in polling and we'll know\nIf he's in a good position Jeff deal if we start to see Republican National committee money come in remember I told you in this very studio I remember sitting across from\nScott Brown became hearing his green pickup truck I'm not kidding in a regular guy and I'm like I knew who Scott Brown was and I know his wife she's very nice woman worked in Boston news\nThis guy that I Know he's really got a chance you know we're all a little bit resigned to Martha Coakley becoming a senator but then the numbers just started to he worked his ass off in that green truck and the numbers started to show wow\nAnd then the Republican National committee started paying attention instead of ignoring Massachusetts and saying we're not going to win a Senate seat in Massachusetts all of a sudden it was hey we could win a Senate seat in Massachusetts and then the money\nStarted pouring in that's the way you can tell that so that's how it will be able to tell don't but I mean the polling you may be but the real folks have to watch or the Republican National committee they start pouring money into Massachusetts that means okay there's a chance here they don't throw good money after bad\nAnd we'll see if there is a we'll see if there is a cabinet bump for him but we'll also see if there's an Indian DNA bumper him you're

G. dot com keyword whether\nPunishment di ... said like Sarah Fox news and the president said yes thing Saudi Arabia will be dealt with and they found that sponsored all the disappearing journalist him off the show\nVery sensitive sources and methods and have some kind of collection either of Mohammed bin Salman or the people around him and that's\nGoing to be the ... that's the kind of decision that is going to be the very top level of any government US government any government whether they're going to let that information get out if they have a short memory could be a human source right we don't know but if you're going to have\nProof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise]\nAh so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet\nUm but I Do think that there is a very real possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one 'cause they're going to say that it's just\nThat happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and or there'll be better in the future or something like that\nAnd got to remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us play quipped sex as secretary of state palm pay Oregon\nTitle for the from the warning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have some understanding of facts which one we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nSurrounding this and I think it's for the number to wherever you want to say thirty two long relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important kind of terrorism or just\nTo do with the two holy sites are\nForty ... alliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and\nMake some big statement here there are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of at our problem I Know that there's symbolism ear journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however\nAnd so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis you certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team and last\nOne the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish it's\nTurkish sovereignty or I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity\nAdded into what would already be an investigation as highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get and how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak\nVice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play clip ten oh I can assure you\nBegan\nThere will be consequences the vice president says noticed that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences\nWould be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nAnd what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want a major break with the Saudis and the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look\nJust remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women who go to school and all these ... which I mean that was happening ... beforehand but you know what I mean and it's going to be a really\nBig step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came to power\nLet me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and\nI Would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach and Saudi Arabia right now only do show with the acceptance and the and they say so of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them it's because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario that the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not affect the wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping to place doesn't\nCollapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government because it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around a one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nA this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them plenty of people at the loudest voices on this do not have\nAmerica's interest necessarily at heart\nThey view this as an opportunity\nTo both criticized and antagonize the Trump Administration that's right as I've been telling you this is supposed to really just turned ... turn into a means of getting at Trump and saying that no matter what happens it's his fault will get into that in a moment door\nSocial media is full of lots and lots of different ways that they can make you disappear they'll tell you that it's just because of a violation of terms of service\nThat's not that sounds like small L liberalism just the guy everything he says it's not true is an idiot [noise]\nDon't want to say mean things you just dumb [noise]\nDoesn't know any international relations either like I should stick to like\nNot talking on TV about that [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nExactly you know because when it comes to the place we saw was tough [noise]\n\nYou got it where you say the Miller is appropriate and independent\nBut you can't answer countless questions about something you said in a meeting with the deputy head of the of the FBI at a time when he was frankly acting head of the FBI 'cause it's a told me he had been fired by the memo you go back and run with a no show last week it is something that is just not right either obligated\nAs a guy who Senate confirmed when the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over your agency asked me to come to Congress and the way he were obligated to do that you're supposed to do with under oath and he was a no cell yeah he's got time to talk to the press about similar to that they gave me a voice\nRosenstein thinks that he's kind of a law unto themselves folks deputy attorney general guy overseeing the Russia investigation really has no problem acting like he is\nPart of his own branch of government and really he's running his own branch of government that branch of\nGovernment is the F. B. a seal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. or to get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hash\nTag resistance and Trump does is to just not worth getting rid of them the ... resistance would call them politically and utterly freak out if in fact there was a a a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care\nHe got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how rose aside once talked about wearing a wire drew accord President Trump you know I really do believe that if when I was a little a little a little nobody CIA analyst\nIf I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I I think I Would have been a squirt it out of the building bicycles by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like buck two weeks ago said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very\nTight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself but that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough\nHere's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus she says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting a reason imitation to testify before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reported comments\n[noise] you know roses there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd I thought the only deep states kind of a deep state update to the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nThis treasury employee who is charged with leaking financial

of our job creation is services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate the economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to have anything that raises the price is a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a tariff it's just another tack\nBefore we're close out here as well as her real quick here to get from a great on the economy a through at what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents have pretty good regulations are down and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a thing as subjectivity in in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way are this way but the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every\nEvery month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound as not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and the NFL who saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Wal Mart and\nI was gonna say Sears All right piece years all righty but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul um let me let me deal with Ron Paul servers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is a\nVery clear history of the currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial\nCalamity is very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that said Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not sound too much debt and all that she can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nSo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I\nJust put his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt\nWe got to remember that\nWe're we're heading in a brand new a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will you know look this is ...\nAnd go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut\nWhen I get home at the thing they exist or you know deciding\nTo just eat half of wheel of breed that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections in the economy\nDoes that sound to fancy rags debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I also like American cheese on America Jews I'm a burger yesterday was delicious\n[noise] ah [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that has to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate needs answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't take action or just means we need to be aware that the action is not going to come quickly and we should\nBalance out what are what what what risks are acceptable what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy for children and grandchildren's economists\nUh and then you Gary Cohn with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given up a lot of credit on the turf issue\nAnd um I've been willing to say that I ... I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists and I know the the smart set is almost always an entirely posted terms\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can\nThat said ah I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going to the economy it's been a ... a few weeks and people have ... ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's\nThat's when you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is a recession or they turn all this raised a creator on the left and they mobilize it and they're going to mobilize it in the direction of socialist that's what they're going to do that is what is coming [noise]\nAh so by the way I\nReally do recommend you all checkout book event dot com it's a project I'm working all the stands for research because I'll go where the market is going that's different from the overall economy but if you want to know where the stock market is going book event dot com smartest guys I've ever met when it comes to the market and we're doing a big event on October twenty four\nTotally free ... dot com sign up check it out you'll see I'll be hosting some other experts I'm just a host the game show host but they're the guys are actually spending the wheels you know what I mean it'll be a lot of fun to check that out but I I'm gonna keep watching the economy and see what's happening I just hope things stay steady intellectually [noise]\nI just saw the c._e._o. of mobile verification network earlier this week we caught up in the swamp here in DC and I said you know how's business going how's your growing so rapidly and\nGetting so many new clients on board he said well simply put buck we're all about making sure that people's data is secure that they get fast answers and that they know the all the work is being done here the United states by trained professionals that's what you get when it comes to background investigations and vetting with global verification network\nAlso whenever you call them you'll get a person who answers your call and answers your questions right away called eight\nSeven seven six nine five one one seven nine eight seven seven six five one one seven I jumped ... cents you this is a veteran owned and operated company my friends you can also go to my GV and dot com that my GV N. dot com for all\nBackground investigations whatever size you were company whatever size we're business my GV\nJordan Lebanese show tomorrow afternoon from three to six on use radio five eighty ... double duty AG from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nWe're cold this evening temperatures will be around thirty degrees from friday Sonia not as cool ties will be in the upper fifties friday night mostly cloudy most jobs around forty degrees in for Saturday partly sunny maybe your chance of showers but the high around sixty degrees you can get your forecast anytime a WTO dot com key word whether [noise]\nItself finally ...
