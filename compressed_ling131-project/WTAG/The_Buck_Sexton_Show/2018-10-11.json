R. T. A.\nUnion Station\nIn that W are too was\nTo read development authority [noise] why not just you know because nobody's renting that space see that's actually my point\nI Would rather rent space for a private individual\nIn this instance\nBecause I think Union Station\nIsn't being marketed properly\nIt is losing money it needs it needs support sodas Union Station in Springfield\nThey're not self sustaining\nAnd you just recycling money if you drop the cannabis control commission and there\nBut I really couldn't care less worthy cannabis control commission goes if they put it in ... out of convenience well that's fine that it makes it easier for people from western mass um to get their people in central mess and hey for once led eastern mascot and the car and drive\nSo that everybody you know it's centrally located\nBut I just think it's a waste of money\nIt's it's you're recycling state money\nAt least somebody who's invested in a building and paying commercial property tax why not rent a space from them if you're not going to have your own space if you don't have a state building where you can put them in\nWhy try to prop up\nA building that should be marketed more effectively\nJust my opinion\nMaybe they're maybe they're dipping into the product a little too much Tammy maybe they are maybe they are dipping into it I'm finally explained the speed at which things are getting done\nWell we just talked about a yesterday with cannabis control which was why don't we have labs testing pot for recreational marijuana outlets yet we have them for medical and the reason is\nFor medical marijuana those those labs are overseen by the department of public health\nFor recreational it's gonna be overseen by the cannabis control commission you know like you know which way to go that way you know like you're pointing at two different directions one hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing\nIt's got to be the same process you're you're testing for um certain compounds and you're testing for to make sure that there's nothing like round up our power caught in the marijuana that you're going to sell\nBut the government is you know let's overlap let's do this let's do that I just don't understand why the cannabis control commissioned couldn't contract with the organizations that are already doing it through the Massachusetts department of public health\nToo deep ph why not\nIt could be done a long time ago but the cannabis control commission is going to go through their own way can you give me imagine that the the kind of a waste of money that is just what kind of waste of money that is\nLet's go to Larry quickly before we get to the break and wants to talk about the candidates control commission hello Harry\nHi them whole can of coke commission stupid way the money Charlie Baker Clinton friends of his eye\nAnd they don't even show up for or when they have it they have they have so far up there but Charlie Baker if I'm going to leave the books are not going to vote project can go on certainly not going to vote for Charlie Baker I'm going to lead that bought blank\nHe's a hypocrite spoke against the president at all what I mean it was running and then as soon as he was elected he jumped on the plane and ran down there with all the uh you know I mean he's he's a home phone\nConsider the all the only thing I'll say is consider the alternative\nClubs are going to leave it blank let them let them get the message\nOkay no I met before in the in the election what it was when it was a Martha Coakley trial\nBut uh yeah I agree there are a hundred percent they definitely the word the better of truly evil but he still legal\nI don't think they go out All right Harry thank you a cannabis control commission but that's how everything works in this state and I don't think that was Charlie bakers uh real idea but that's how everything works in this state that's what we wanted\nWe want it to legalize marijuana Baker did not support it um I didn't support legalization of recreational marijuana mistake 'cause I think it's an issue that has to be settled federally then you know what they're still going to be a big underground selling pot\nA different attorney general a different department of justice looking at it let's see how that goes there is nothing that stops the deejay from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you start to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith\nThere really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits on an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows\nBut you do not have the right to a speedy investigation\nIn fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know that some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they've pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that this system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F ... style can serve I used to be the mind that you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the da da da da de la ... told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay who actually makes a decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges let's see what the deal Jay determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll bought no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that mess\nThat mess speaking the FBI by the way\nYou know Rand Paul who is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd give it all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's what we have the constitution that's where we ask you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner for that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning the given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these process these work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again in remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party this this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat or political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government for partisan purposes and there's been no real change there's\nBeen you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government\nIs full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but a patently not\nSeem it as an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on all the things that matter to us as Americans every day and you know your opinion matters to

Washington Post the central issue of twenty Eighteen\nIs health care I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question for us over Roy is with us now\nIs the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over great to have you\nSay buck so a ... first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I look at it pretty closely at that particular question I haven't seen any polling data\nTo suggest that health care right now is motive motivating people to turn out ah for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever at the midterms are gonna be over you know the fuck your listeners know this is seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge truck and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about who is going to outbid who who's going to be the truth blues purists on single payer Democrats\nIn the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this thought that it she's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election whereas the left positioning itself but where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nYeah one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas law suit\nOr which aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with a preexisting conditions provision ... and so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because they're pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that well for me so there is a lot of these rape is a lot of talk about preexisting conditions when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what can we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it's not so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans want it to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last ten years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party\nIf you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge to every Democrat fields that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically one single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and can never happen\nThey use philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not gonna they're not going to deny that they're forcing the air they're going to say yeah unfortunately they're all the time over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that oh you you know over you've been involved in this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate were the projections of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion of the country back in the early days the Obama administration has it been\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm going to call Republicans racist or something it's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle that's the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by Warner Brawley who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case they settled this she than a centrally refuse to pay and it has since\nMoved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to wanna Brawley a few years ago and found that\nShe was living\nSomewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation\nSettlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine when\nYou hear today from people saying oh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim there are these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut ... let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was the road and we mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey claim that New York the most visible\nSingle place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today Democrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member remember when he says yeah those those uh those speeches about the snow\nThen and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like ... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless bad and you all you do as little\nBloomberg Espanol ... I I that was great that was ... those are simpler tires producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know that the you know the snow is\nCold and they will move it we we wrap you do that was only a scene the Blasio coming\nI Know we we didn't know what we had you see the Blasio are read by the way he's so there's the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody ... was talking about housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIt cause you liked that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess for our we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real\nLotta stretching it a lot of political and then when somebody comes up to them in the gym is a public official he gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy system the Mets anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was\nThe one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nLarge number of these stop and frisk the hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall on the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped bless\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it looks bad on them and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd and continued downward trajectory on crime but\nIs that reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in\nIn the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like it was already happening and the crime\nWas already happening the only point I think that's very fair to make on this is a conservative along did say if you got to stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about to stop and frisk in Chicago\nNobody has any ideas for how to make Chicago a less crime ridden place I mean that's the number of shootings people think of ... and I look that obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot it's a low it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stab than any given year\nThat's a lot of people that are getting shot no one has\nAny solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lips and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nOh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school at come out and this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a\nA mother and father both in the household the crime rate is essentially the same across all ah\nAll all cultures and all ethnic backgrounds\nSo you can have the structural conversation about why this violence and places like Chicago or you can't talk about more aggressive policing and say that's raises and at the end of the day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being ... and they're protecting civil rights of minorities but you're just going to have having more people getting shot\nAnd they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton\nHe's running around and demagogue ing well this sharp as what he does struggling runs around and and demagogues and things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away\nYou know liberals would prefer to call Republicans racist and its Sharpton to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was that there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in\nYou know a numbers ... numbers based policing a calm stat\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling and shrieking over that too but then they realize oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen for Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violent situation on the control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in charge [noise] global verification\nNetwork is the answer to all your background investigation and vetting needs they're the only dual certified veteran owned company of its kind\nYou

mid year at a mid term cycle as a party in power manage to hold onto their majorities will see governors races by the way geo piece looking pretty good there too\nSo despite all the things you hear it right now I I think that we should just remember not only does history show us that\nThis stuff can be wrong I must say it will be 'cause I don't believe anybody can predict the future as you know I'm very consistent with that I think that you can you can have some fun with your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever forget your losers\nProducer Mike it's like the secret of being a good stock broker just going to make sure you focus on your winters meant if you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody

with her and I thought you know as crazy as that is at least give her points for creativity because you yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane too big not off like a lot of leg room\nBut could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with you yes you could now people are starting to crack down on this and and I got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it\nThere was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida or just a few days ago and she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support\nSquirrel\nAnd sure enough they had a problem with that because there is a policy\nThat frontier airlines does not allow rodents aboard flight so they they are anti wrote inch at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nA but I've got to say\nIf you're trying to expand your horizons for what could be a ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subways you do here in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying to carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think a score it would be in the same category so that she does a part of me John it's like hey\nMaybe she's got a really close bond with this coral maybe this squirrel is very meaningful to her\nAnd you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel but then there's the other side of me that had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John it was supposed to take off as one hour flight\nFrom Las Vegas to San Diego and it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning to you know when that flight actually took off seven pm at night almost a twelve hour delay for not for weather weather as weather\nRight that's that's a that's gods deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues and\nI can tell you that I lose patience very quickly when I'm In that airport lab and not lounge airport area you know the little chairs they set up at all face each other it's kind of creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else people tend not to be staring at them but you're staring at them\nAnd they don't want you to I was ... you don't want to lose your temper uh but what can you do there's not much you can do show on the one hand I feel like emotional support squirrel I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like\nIf I were there and I was told that somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat but I Would feel I find out one way or the other that squirrel that that emotional support squirrel would probably be toast and I'm going to get all the hate bill from Peter now but we eat we eat out all kinds of animals you know I eat obviously cow and\nPig pens are smart I've actually hung out with pet pigs before all micro pigs that are kind of a fun thing ... why do we draw the line John at squirrels why do we discriminate against emotional support squirrels but we think that cat somehow the superior species I don't have an answer for you the\nTruth is if you give me the choice between the pets growing pet cat I don't know\nSquirrels much more portable or they are good at hoarding their own food you know they bury the little acorn and stuff there there's a lot to recommend squirrels and what have you know the emotional support animal scam is looks like it's coming to an end I have friends who have gone through the whole process of getting a little vest for their dog\n'cause you get an emotional support best or that's what it says a service dog\nAnd you have to be allowed in everywhere with service dog because of people who have\nReal issues that the service dog is addressing now there's been a little bit of a\nOf an explosion of people that say that whatever the dog like they have a service Chihuahua and they put a little vest on it and I will say service dog when really they just mean it serves there need to have their pooch with them at all times that's not really what they're going for service dogs\nSo emotional support squirrel held this thing up for a couple of hours people were obviously very upset about it they did it scored her off this this plane", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Worcester", "day": "11"}
