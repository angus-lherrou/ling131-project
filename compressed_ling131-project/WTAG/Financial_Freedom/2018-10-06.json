or ... socks a U.S stocks versus international\nRight now and we've seen this divergence and you know where us stocks despite some political risks despite the fears of an all out trade war from these you know pick for attack tariffs that have been\nUm are being implemented a particularly with China who was a you know another global world leader\nA in a huge trade partner of ours um we've seen the disparity between us stocks continue to rise and be resilient and international stocks really take a bit of a dive\nI'm now some of that is based upon the corporate earnings growth\nAnd profitability being very strong still in this country I'm from a number of factors but still the corporate tax cuts are are taking a fact I'm you know wages inflation is is going up consumer spending is up I'm\nStill a lot of these are things have been supportive to a U.S stock market um whereas international in it a lot of cases they've been doing fine on their own in terms of in their\nIn their national currencies like so you know if you look at\nSay European markets um you know when valued in the euro they've actually been doing pretty well this year there you know there are positive ah you know mid single digit returns a fairly close to us stocks that the big difference this year\nHas been the fact that the dollar as a currency has continued to strengthen\nAgainst most other major currencies and so what happens is when we\nWe as all of our clients do um their money in their investments is denominated in US dollars so if you own a foreign investment in despite at doing well in that foreign uh denominated currency when at the returns are converted back\nTo US dollars you're getting fewer of them because the dollar keeps growing relative to other international currency is now\nIt's not necessarily um you know a good thing for the U.S it does make us less competitive from a global trade standpoint um but that is a big factor but\nDespite that a ... you know disparity in returns um you know us stocks are now trading at their highest premiums relative to international shares in years and so despite what's going on we do still think that there's a great opportunity with international stocks\nI'm so when we get back from the first break I'm going to talk a little bit about that and why you should remain physicians\nNot only in the u._s. but outside where there's a lot of opportunity\nAt our financial they provide simple techniques that can help you make the most of your money and help work toward a cheating more of your financial goals retirement plans education

are a considerably overvalued at this point in a despite all the political or risks and currency risks and other things with investing internationally\nThey're trading at a major discount right now so they're out of favor there on loved\n'em and so we think that there's a very decent potential that these international companies could outperform U.S companies\nAre when we look over the next several years because there is that sick locality and just based upon fundamentals um they've never looked so you know they haven't looked this cheap relative to a U.S stocks in a long time so consider\nA

inevitable I'm part of life um it's something that people push often intend to avoid\nAnd you know with a lot of you know with most of clients who are in a really strong financial position and they know that you know they're they're okay and you know they've got enough\nIncome and liquidity and you know to to meet their standard of living and keep them comfortable and you know give them options

really taken a leading role because we feel we have the best product and now the best product combination\nWith other ingredients we've combined with fish oil deliver even better benefits for people\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp resident a lot of development purity Bronx about I'm exciting new products will be able to look to simply through purity ... the omega three super no\nWe've got a special offered me a free bottle offers the tune we're going to be given up that phone number ... g's than let's get to ingredient number two because ... three super bill does something that no other visual product can do it actually lowers cholesterol\nTalk about these plants ... explain how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown\nTo lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol HDL the good cholesterol though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target\nLDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in as little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from\nFive to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level safely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties\nAnd they work would be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this is an alternative to Staten\nStaten work by preventing the\nProduction of cholesterol in the liver plant sterile work differently they block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called\nMy feels into thinking that the plants their roles\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so the mice deals pick up the plant sterile instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead sort of just get passed through your intestines in you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them\nThe point is if you're on that and you can take Lance they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants their role is to deliver the benefits as shown in the studies\nThat something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow Jason was talking about the third ingredient in the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all over the world tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what is what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell and your body and they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you leave the earth unfortunately as you age\nYou lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten one word should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy\nWithout co enzyme Q. ten ... is the critical\nPivotal energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy efficient sell\nSo co enzyme Q. ten delivers a whole ton Napoli of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams\nA perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure it's great for your gums if you're a person who has tender gums maybe when you've lost their brush your teeth you noticed a little ... maybe a little bleeding could be a sign that you've got a co Q. deficiency coincide Q. ten supports immune function it\nSupports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti oxygen in fact one of the most powerful anti accident\nEver discovered they're actually taking a look now at Cohen's on Q. ten in its role in exercise and muscle performance\nOne other interesting no coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled zap them as little as ten weeks or so when used topical he's a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and so the three in one product we're talking about these three amazing ingredient extremely safe for a long term use for short term youth in any dosage\nAnd I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking one or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is this safe should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients than the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as if the super ... wasn't enough with the co Q. ten for energy the plants generals for controlling cholesterol and the fish oil for just about everything else purity is putting together an offer you see people can't refuse tell me about this great double free offer you got going on right now today to get people started\nThat's Wright Patt we're letting anyone out there give this product they're really good road test put it to the test for yourself here's how it works you just pay for\nNinety five for shipping and then we'll send you a free bottle that said even the shipping is refundable by the way but what we're doing today and what we don't ordinarily do with these free bottle offers that we run on our radio shows\nGive away a second free gift now we just got this brand new what we call our beep twelve easy mouth that's really one of the more exciting really interesting products that we've launched recently it's a little tiny tablet that you put under your tongue and it just melts\nAnd you get this surge of energy\nFrom a relatively high dose of B. twelve now be twelve is well you know how people who if someone is feeling a bit run down they may go to the doctor and the doctor may look at their blood and say oh you need a shot at B. twelve then they get the shot to be twelve and what happens\nThey feel like they're shot from a gun they feel amazing B. twelve certainly if you're deficient and if you restore it\nBack you can see a tremendous difference in your sense of wellbeing and your energy in your vitality\nIn how you feel well this is just a special fast melting tablet it dissolves in your mouth and a few seconds it's absolutely delicious and the idea is that it's sort of like a\nShot without the needle because you get incredible bio availability by taking it this way and then you get just that\nNatural energy surge along with all of the benefits that be twelve has that in many ways compliment the benefits of omega three B. twelve is great for your heart it's great for your brain from mood for easing occasional stress for managing something called
