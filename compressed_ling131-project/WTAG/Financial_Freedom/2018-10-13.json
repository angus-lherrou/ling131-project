kind of hoarding NATO effort jak\nWell well what happens is is that every RSVP program must be sponsored locally by either at a nonprofit I'm a city government\nAnd or a hospital or school system sometimes a university and family services was selected to be the sponsor for\nOur program oh great so you have a good working relationship with the family serve yes that's good to have a partner what it is and as you guys do some great things there so that I just you\nAbsolutely do lots of great things mediation home care I'm a Center for childcare careers a there's a clinical a part of the program um a counseling I'm Sorry and da de\n... and today so for this segment we're going to talk about RSVP senior fraud help line and senior fraud in general right we noted in your fraud is a is a we talked about a couple of examples are in the previous segment\nThat it's a it's a really big fan I mean it's something that we need to bring attention to now only seniors everybody everybody out the amount of fraud I mean how big is that problem like what is the scope\nOf ... ... um so there are lots of different national um\nEntities trying to collect data on this and it's very difficult to do so um but we know that it's at least a several billion dollars a year flow out of the hands of seniors and into the hands of someone who is\nA taking their money and won't give it back a frog leaders you bet and um it ranges from a few hundred dollars someone may lose to what I Would say is priceless and that's your identity identity theft being a huge problem and I'm\nI'm that's something that is being tackled in the commonwealth by attorney general more heat only are they about a year ago began um the coalition um the ages coalition against identity theft and I'm\nI'm a part of that and I'm proud to be a part of that that's the state is really pushing this and trying to get a handle on what's happening because every single time a seniors defrauded\nLikely is it that the money will flow right out of Worcester county I think we mentioned that in the ... and I'm not staying here and most importantly not staying in the hands of someone who earned that money set it aside planning for later years and now because\nThey're probably not working anymore has no opportunity to recoup that loss right\nSo it's not only a individual problem if it's a community it is a huge\nCommunity problem and ah to the extent that the community embraces this problem\nAnd that everyone is aware of what's what's going on a people will um hopefully retain their money and not just mentioned that the supermarkets a number of the supermarket chains are protecting cash cards if someone wants a cash\nCard at the register which is off in a way that fraudsters ask\nPeople to send their money in let's say they're buying multiples of that was\nThe cashier will say I'm Sorry I'm going to have to ask you to go to the surface desk to purchase two hundred and fifty dollar cash Carter are multiples of the same and at the service desks now in a number of supermarket chains people are trained in this issue and they're saying is anyone\nReally pushing you to send this card or these cards today\nOr cash car is that like a visa cash like\nI'm a two hundred and fifty dollar ... yeah I don't want to name\nA visa ... the charge you buy are right on the by the when you kind of ... yes yeah that's what they asked them to go and buy that then literally pay him that way so they can't trade absolutely\nSo they can sing yeah\nIt's terrible it's like the the Irish iris scams that we mentioned earlier and I kind of off topic but no you know people call but I guess they do that with juniors to alright well saying that the IRS and that and in one thing I Do know is the IRS does not call you the IRA everything you know through the mail\nYou the IRS ... that's right and so anyone you should hang up on anyone who says I'm with the IRS we have people who call us at our senior brought help line who are petrified because they just got a call from the IRA petrified they're afraid they're going to jail\nAnd you know and when you're very frightened\nYou will do things that maybe in a commerce state you might not do so there's a deliberate\nAbsolutely deliberate I'm a attempt on the part of someone calling too frightened this person half to death\nRight at the terrible right so then you just go from financial issues and and being fraud defrauded and losing money to an emotional off coming in and wrote emotional wrecks\nRight well if you don't report it red rye important it is a hoax imperative it is to report rise scams or at least call the help line\nRight in ... or embarrassed when this happens today but the help lines can be anonymous right and just get some guidance and confidence that you know these are the right people that can help you\nWrite that help line can be anonymous you can get help without telling us any anything about yourself which\nWe would like for you to take advantage of because if you're embarrassed we understand that but one of the best things about the help line is that it's peer to peer so we have compassionate\nSeniors who answered the phone and they will listen to what you have to say they will try to help you with your concerns and they will also make referrals to other entities who may help you recoup that money or at least report it to the correct\nPeople that I'm sure some of the people that are receiving these calls have been through something or dealt with something or know someone and they obviously talked to a lot of people that have been affected by this you're\nAbsolutely right and they've been trained by someone from the district attorney's office by someone from um the attorney general's consumer rights program by someone um who\nHas ... knowledge of this in their own family et cetera et cetera so there there's the problem is well known to them resources they have at their fingertips um but it's really important to get an aggregate number of the types of scams and frogs that are out there\nAnd that's that's where I went to and we we only have a few bucks five more minutes but let's talk about some of those camps the types of scams\nOkay so uh we already talked about the euro winter scam so I'll just say quickly that delivery systems for these scams our newspaper on line phone\nA hall last posters out there on on that you might see attached to a telephone pole the u._s. mail which can and hopefully be re mediated through the postal inspector and someone coming to your front door\nJust a you know people leave their doors open or unlocked and the reality is is that people will come to your front door and before you even know if you've been um you've been scammed or that personal identity has been taken particularly if people come in pairs\nAnd it's never safe to open your door to someone you don't know\nAnd if you do you know you could be creating a world of trouble for yourself that you can't even begin to imagine\nOther types of scams imposter scams\nWith winter coming on I Want to remind people\nThat if someone drives up in an official looking vehicle but you can't really quite see what it is they may have a hat on that says something about electrical company\nYou've lost power you've been without power for a few hours and they say you know what we know it might be difficult to wait we'll hook you up a little bit in advance\nYou know for two hundred and fifty dollars\nIf you do that and of course they disappear and by the time you get your lights on you think\nThat they've had committed you don't even reported don't even report it\nWhich is really off you know if these scammers they put all this time and energy to create these big schemes her right they probably go start a business or something that I write something more you know to contribute to society and yet it's amazing yeah I wanted to mention opportunities for youth scams\nOftentimes financial investment scams which is why it's really important not to respond to someone who contacts you out of the blue either on the phone or on line go with a known entity I mean you know you just talked about Chris the fact that you would have required training every year that I'm\nAround this issue and stuff go with someone who's reputable you're not going to get rich quick if someone basically takes fifty thousand dollars because of your money because you think you're going to make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars which you will never see\nRight and if it's too good to be true times you mentioned this on the show\nIt's too good to be true absolutely\nRight and that's why we emphasize a lot of our uh you know discussion with clients is forming that financial\nYou write that trusted team your your CPA your financial advisor and attorney a family member or someone that you can bounce ideas off now you have a a a hotline that you can call\nBut you can also you know an investment decisions you want to run that decision by one or two people or maybe a trusted family member in your house before\nYou just blatantly you know give somebody money or give 'em your credit card information so it's it's just setting up a you know what a check you know you know like a checklist yes like I Can't make this decision because I have to talk to these two people I'm Sorry I call me back and I'll write you know talk to you about\nWhich of course they will try to talk you out of oh no you sound like a really with the guy you can make this decision on your own absolutely you don't you don't need to talk to them that I'm here with you now and it's unbelievable I mean your money yeah [laughter]\nI mean we could do a a another show on ask because there's so many examples and I think ... extremely helpful I mean I think we should\nAs affirmed should understand these scams a little more 'cause we get really you know we get really tight with our clients and they call us and yeah you know we want to help them in any way possible ... before we before we end the show can you give out the number again in how they get in touch with your help line\nYeah so it's RSVP senior fraud helpline sponsored by Harvard pilgrim health care and it's one eight hundred\nTo nine seven nine seven six so and I just want to give a little tagline here if for any reason you have difficulty connecting with someone on the help line\nFor any reason please call our western opposite five oh wait seven nine one seven seven eight seven and we are there to help you\nVery nostalgic when you go in there because you see these big high voltage ceilings and you just know that it was not a store to begin with so\nYeah back when it was built it was when horses you know before they had fire trucks horses lived in that building Oh nice yeah so yeah that's pretty cool\nSo far away presents when you open we're open Monday through friday nine to six and Saturday Night five excellent Saturdays are bustling and fun and there's always a wine tasting had yes part of my favorite parts about going in on Saturday yeah we've actually extended them so they're twelve to ... for every Saturday\nAnd it's

don't we start with one of the products that you brought in today\nSo today I brought\nThere is a new product to us called sugar Bob smoked maple syrup and I feel like this is something you I Would love it and all of it the reason you're one of my favorite people talk about food with just for so many reasons but you always have creative uses for things [noise] um this when I first started smokes maple syrup do I like the combination\nAnd it's surprisingly is wonderful um you could use it for dipping sauce you could make a shrimp cocktail saw side of it and I saw today on their website an idea to glaze ... oh what's more fall\nThan that I bet you that would make a delicious base for a barbecue sauce you get the sweet and the smoke at the same time exactly and the beauty of a lot of these

sweet hot ... I had never heard of it and I know a few days ago\nSo where did you find that was a vendor did eventually come in or did you go to a food show\nWe ... a lot of these products we have a wonderful vendor in Vermont and\nThe beauty of this vendor is they're getting things direct from farms and direct from suppliers and bring it to you it's not sitting in a warehouse so they get a lot of our cheeses from Vermont for which is lovely that they have these deals where they pick it up and it's\nIt's at our store days later same with for example we now carry something called boy didn't farm beef so this is this phenomenon natural be from a farm in Vermont and\nIt comes from the farm and it's like at our store two days later and we put it right into the freezer so can you know to buy it from our freezer and take it home but\nIt's love ... right now while W a high quality\nThat pretty spectacular yeah so um we're going to take a break a everyone you're listening to W. ... talking food with ed hires Mediterranean marketplace I have Maryam ... in Studio with me I'm ...

Mediterranean marketplace my name is Janine I'm the host than I Am in Studio today with Merriam ... who's from at ... Mediterranean marketplace and we are talking about\nThe favorite time of year\nTo talk about your favorite fall suits and the topic right now is maple because Vermont is\nYou know one of them very close states to us and we um get some great products from there so the last segment we talked about the smoke to maple syrup and the the maple syrup Raja which I'm going to have to buy just because I've never had it\nBefore I even have to take one of those home pretty soon and make a spicy chicken salad or put it on like a pulled pork sand oh that would be ... ... ... oh yeah mouth watering yet oh my God I think as soon as we finished the segment we might need help in the car and go to Vermont is up there because now\nI'm thinking about the you know the beautiful leaves turning and just going in and enjoying some New England foods and later donor to the local fire\nA long line of products fourteen Fifteen of them we oh my goodness\nWe probably carry about fourteen right now maybe they're upwards of twenty even\nWe have there naked line which is if you like I Know you don't love a ton of sugar so that would be a perfect line for you to shop from um it's jams where no sugar has been added and it's just a natural sweetness from the fruit yeah we also have their specialty line that's meant for cheese pairing so for instance\nThe one I brought today two of them I brought today to show you a strawberry and it's not just regular strawberry and strawberry with Madagascar vanilla which as anyone who bakes knows that is the\nThe vanilla to use them baking on this one is to be paired with creamy pre oh at but again I'm a believer in whatever you love if you want that with\nA cheddar put it on a ... it's probably going to be great um I also brought Meyer lemon with honey which sounds lovely which is different than any lemon and this one is meant preparing was good at ...\nNice mhm you know I Would love to be in a Test Kitchen and\nBe a food taster for what they prepare you know that's a bucket list for me I just I've always wanted to do that I just think it's ... I Would love to give my honest opinion you get I Would not be able to say things like ooh yucky 'cause I'm pretty sure that's\nNot going to work [laughter] or\nWhatever [laughter] I Know [laughter]\nBut I Would love to be able to be on the on the food tasting side once they've created a new product that's really something I've always always wanted to do\nAnd and companies like this I mean they it might be a small Test Kitchen you know you really want to make it perfect way it goes to market\nWell late friday have set themselves to standard and they don't want a depth below that exactly you don't get you don't get the food Oscar for nothing exactly [laughter]\nAnd what fun with any of these be if you can wash it down with a local adult beverage right right um I Know that you're a fan of locally made ragged hill fighter yes from ragged he'll orchards and Westbrook field and that is a product we just probably started carrying as of last weekend that's fantastic\nAnd that's another thing I really enjoy talking with you about because you're so passionate about finding fresh local and my ... I mean surrounding states 'cause New England really you can get anywhere in three hours from the central Massachusetts so you can get to Vermont you can get to New Hampshire and get to Rhode Island you can get to Connecticut\nIt's a little bit of a stretch to get to Maine there's traffic but you can do it and so and I liked the fact that you pull products locally\nWell one of the things I fall in love with when I look for new products or I'm at a show um is\nThe people behind them you know you don't want to buy from some big generic company but when you meet the person behind a product to has the history and it's a family that's worked really hard which I can relate to write one family business buying from another to me there's nothing more beautiful than at ... and\nYou get to hear their story and and how their family started and how hard they work to get to the place they're at and\nOf course I'd want to take on that product as long as it tastes wonderful but you know it's so nice to be able to reach out and pick up the phone and call the owner of another company and say you know your jams are doing great can you send us twelve more cases for Christmas nice so that no one had\nResidents in business on a personal level that really you know makes it work you know your small business in a big town but you carry products from small businesses around New England in addition to the ones that you import 'em but I just think it's great that you support small\nBusiness if it's my favorite thing you know the whole business yeah um for instance a customer came in last\nYear one of our a frequent customers and we'd been trying to find some local honeys 'cause that's really important for people refer from allergies and also people just want to buy local product any way to help the local economy and he said oh by the way I'm a beekeeper\nWould you be interested in taking on my honey and we're like yeah this is what we've been waiting for a so now we sell circle seven honey out of ... which is made by one of our customers that's awesome it's just to me it's a beautiful story\nThat is a beautiful story so we're going to be taking a break and just a moment or I Am Jenny I'm the host of WTO ... talking food ah with advisers Mediterranean marketplace marry him high to resent talking about the\nLocal ... favorites that are available for purchased at your store ... at ...
