come off of a a few really challenging weeks I'm In the market\nUh with significant declines end up seeing a good balance in the markets today a which is a bit encouraging and you know the markets trying to find its direction in\nTerms of whether this is there's there's a few more percent or or more to fall until it's sort of finds it's temporary bottom or if it's going to reverse course in a is sort of steadily increased uh from the low point that we just saw you know yesterday on all this this past Wednesday\nI'm similar to how it came back from the late January early February corrections\nWrite down a little bit more you know from that first direction but I've I've mentioned many shows and enrich has that\nHistorically the market does have two to three of these five percent plus corrections per year but the thing that makes this you know ... or or or really makes everyone recognized what's going on in the markets it's so quick\nAnd one day it goes down three percent the essence he was down three percent on Wednesday ... the NASDAQ was down ... percent on Wednesday so instead of a steady you know four percent decrease over thirty day period\nHaving it in one day it makes the news was talking about it right it makes you start you know question where where am I my positions and so it makes it creates more emotion I write a quick or the ... and that's the technology age right now in the rhythms and you know money just floods out of stocks so movingly\nBecause of these triggers that are created from algorithms right\nTo ride technological right the computerized trading I'm quick dissemination of information\nYou know everyone has a look at the literally the you know their fingertips the latest market updates and guess what I mean the media they

the fear based stories and so they love to to talk about that and you know like are just talking with a client I'm this morning\nHe was talking to you know he's a early retirees been retired for probably about five or so years uh early seventies and saying that you know he remembers back in say you know the sixties when\nA a six hundred point drop\nOn the Dow would've you know nearly wiped out a portfolio bright and you know you're talking to a fact depending on what year you're looking if you go back forty\nPlus years fifty years I'm ... you know six hundred points on that that would have been you know thirty percent on I'm On it you know half of the value depending on where you know what a\nDate you're talking about but nowadays six hundred points yeah it's it's it's still a big drop but you know not even three percent so\nIt's always ... you want to look at the percentage and I think the one big mistake people make is they only look at the dial when clients collie oh my God the Dow was down three hundred two hundred points\nI mean that's thirty stocks right the S. and P. five hundred is five hundred stocks that gives you a better gauge on where us stocks are heading or the performance\nThey they they are very correlated but I Would look at both index is not just the Dow industrial average drew a thirty stocks versus five hundred\nAnd when I talk a little bit later in the show though\nHow important diversification is right if your portfolio is all in stocks then you're going to be very correlated did he has to be five hundred readiness and he goes down two percent you're down to ... percent right if you'd diversified and you know we're going to talk about sixty forty portfolio\nAnd why that will benefit you in the long run and benefit clients in

you long run so we're we're going to talk about some of that market inside some sort of perspective historically on\nThe markets corrections like the one we're seeing now a I'm also I'm like Chris

I lost several thousand dollars in a day or two I mean that's not\nI'm not comforting to anybody but you know like you mentioned Chris I'm\nThe average five percent decline in the market uh index happens almost a few times a year like two and a half to three times per year average a correction you know as defined by a a ten percent or more drop happens almost once every year\nIt just it protects that income and we're not seeing isn't guarantees but you know and our experience that fuck it has not moved you know maybe over a three of four month period like Ryan was suggesting about bonds the bond market is down ... percent right about two percent and he had a gate\nNow remember we still have one quarter of interest payments rights of the bond market doesn't move those bonds that consistently paying interest payments in so did it ends up being paid by mutual funds in interest payments from individual bond so\nIf the if the the market's stays the bond market stays flat you're going to catch up just from interest payments that's why I bought by bonds to earn income and informants interests whether it's a CD or bond I have to get inconsistent income which is consistent cash flow\nRight absolutely and so you know if we think about you know just these past few weeks people have gotten very concerned about the stock market of course right because it's it's been dropping pretty precipitously\nUm however prior to a few weeks ago I think a lot of investors were a bit frustrated that the stock market as represented by the U.S in the five hundred was up seven or eight percent at that time and\nHaving a diversified portfolio wasn't up nearly as much you know ... percent and it's sort of that\nYou know that the frustration of a well diversified portfolio is understandable when you see the stock market hitting new record highs um but it is a bit shortsighted because and I think investors need to understand that owning a diversified portfolio to actually be a bit difficult to own\nAnd the reason for that psychologically is you're still going to lose money in a bear market when stocks or\nYou know getting pummeled 'em and you're probably gonna trail most the time the S. and P. five hundred in the stock index during the bull market so you know it kind of a ... it's sort of feels like you're you're you're always losing out somehow and and it's you know an emotional\nI'm sort of behavioral a issue that is fundamental the financial planning and we have to understand because\nYou know so if you look back since two thousand I'm you know if you look for the year two thousand two thousand and two the S. and P. five hundred was down almost thirty eight percent\nA diversified or using a sixty four sixty percent and us stocks forty percent and us bonds\nA diversified portfolio is only down Thirteen percent but hey if you have a million dollars you're not a hundred and thirty three thousand\nYou still living money so you might say I lost money you know then over two thousand and three to two thousand seven for the next four years yes and the five hundreds of eighty three percent you're only fifty eight percent so then you have to say I didn't make as much you know so far as I lost money now not making as much as the market\nWho short term times in history right too short like one of those two years in the first one in ... in a second right content\nIn two thousand eight you have that really bad one year that started in on um oh seven and continue to know nine But Justin calendar year oh wait the market was down thirty seven percent in a diversified portfolio you still lost twenty so again I lost money right and then the rebound over the last several years\nYou know traveling again are only about half almost as much as the return so instead of three hundred percent increase only a hundred and sixty six so again I haven't made as much money were not keeping up but when you look at the total return\nThe diversified portfolio with a much smoother ride actually pays the S. and P. five hundred new\nYour total return um was saddled with much less volatile is that the wind by not losing mentality\nAbout Twenty years right Eighteen Nineteen yeah\nIs Eighteen year period right here so that's something to keep in mind we have to wrap up this break but you're listening to Ryan and Chris on the car finance or to financial freedom show we'll be right back\n\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid plans in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more likely to go family care dot

freedom shown first currently here with rain can't trace both partners have car financial group thanks for joining us\nToday I'm just to recap uh Ryan made a great point when we when it's a last break\nAbout how a diversified portfolio\nHas outperformed alright diversified meaning sixty percent stocks forty percent fixed income\nHas outperformed individuals ... five hundred over about a twenty year period but in those short term you know periods in time we're like well I didn't know perform this year you're not going to outperform the S P in one year\nAnd you're not going to perform it when it's only a bull market bike\nSo so since since March of oh nine all the way up till you know at least last month anyway before we had this is the rough October I'm\nYou know ... unless you had all stocks you're not going to be an all stock portfolio away\nSome light on ... face you know most people going into retirement in retirement than sixty forty portfolio exec because folks remember your portfolio half the last Twenty years you don't just rush into bonds because you're in retirement you still need growth\nBut it's it's how you diversified you know so remember ... when you're looking at your portfolio set expectations you should understand how your portfolio is allocated\nIn what you expect you put the leaders do ended up market and it down market right talk your advisor about that so you're not wondering why you know the U.S in peace up ten and I'm only up six well you've got sixty percent sucks right you have a lot less risk and the reason that\nA sixty forty portfolio outperformed the S. and P. five hundred ... from two thousand to today was because those two big down years right like that's what's detrimental is going down forty percent when the market goes down forty\nRight each China was less than two years right so the recession after two thousand the tech bubble um you know didn't even last a couple of years but all stock portfolio lost close to forty percent and then the two thousand I'm you know seven to beginning of oh nine lost over forty percent forty two percent so\nThat type of risk is unacceptable for most retire isn't you know and it can be challenging as you go on especially in the year like this where\nThe market at least up until a few weeks ago had really been out performing bonds were down or other you know cash was basically flat gold down international stocks down so\nMore challenging I think than most but again it's that disciplined approach that can give you more consistency overtime and by avoiding though the extent of losses from an all stock portfolio you\nCan actually ended up keeping pace in a reasonable way over a long term we just haven't seen that it's been so long that people kind of ... are starting to forget how painful it is to lose money and not to lose\nYou know only a few percent or even ... percent like we've seen over the past few weeks I mean that's difficult I think on a million dollars in a you know one year later because he wanted to get\nMaybe a little bit greedy and say boy all the ... the stocks are flying and let me go more attacks stocks than you know to have that million dollars shaved down to five hundred and fifty thousand twelve months later and then that can be a real problem you know then whatever's should and having the\nDiscipline not to sell those stocks when they're down right and a lot of times in these below markets what does it bring new retail investors we get cause\nHe I haven't been in the market before in it that long conversation with someone that wants to go in for the first time because we're all time highs which is usually the worst thing to do right and then all of a sudden the market turns on you and you're like well I get a get out I got to sell\nWell if you didn't go in with a strategy you shouldn't be talking about that\nRight because you have an understanding of how long do your money is going to be invested ... set expectations for yourself\nRight that's very important um and there is always comes back to what your goals are right and then so\nClass working with us I'm not not that some of them don't get nervous and worried when there's market volatility of course they do I mean we do we're we're humans its its emotional it's a it's money it's it's we know that it's not just money it's about your future like rich card man that it meets other goals um\nBut if we take the time and you know any advisors who are worth their salt they take the time to understand you\nYour goals and also what the future cash needs are in sort of in a conservative measure set you up for the right allocation that's going to be the right balance between\nBut certainly on the kind of you know the asset level of you know where where ... um what's the income how's that going to affect any financial aid algebra we our assets located and how does that impact\nAny potential aid that you can get in one to talk about a few of the major ones that we see\nI'm One of the biggest ones um that we've seen is our\nParents saving for their kids' education\nUm but putting it into the child's name\nUm whether it's on even a joint bank accounts with their child listed a lot of people do that or they set up a custodial account like in ... you know form transfer to minors act that's a custodial account or they they'll say hey you've got a savings account we're going to get this money and you'll use it for college bad idea\nIt's probably the biggest mistake you can make if you're going to be eligible for eight and remembered than only if you're eligible these are the things like having students at a ... assets\nIn the student's name is going to affect you getting\nFinancial aid and when we me and you know you have to do a calculation through the FAFSA website where it will give you the expected family contribution right so having money in the kid's name is the biggest mistake ... again if you do qualify and a lot of people do qualify\nRight and ... and even if you first of all the first thing I think it will say is that even if you don't think you'll qualify\nDo the fast and do it every year in because ... ability can change 'em and you know like we were just talking about now before the break\n... things are drastically different if you have a second child in college at the same time are we have I have a couple of glass I have\nThree kids in college you know in that for years and they may not have received aid on the first child but with child two or three in that burden of expenses can qualify them plus it just opens up the doors to some other programs as well so you want to do that\nUm but when you're saving the child's name it's considered a ... child asset in it reduces any potential\nAid by twenty cents on the dollar\nWhereas if you have it in your own him as the parent um there is a a parent assets reporting but the ... it's a ... scale but the maximum rate they could reduce it by his five point six four percent so ... it could be you know four times as detrimental basically [noise]\nUm [noise] another one that's come up is the idea of you know these college savings plans five twenty ninth grade vehicle they they're flexible they've tax advantage is a lot of benefits\nLot of people will have their folks their their parents may the grandparent of the student set up a five twenty nine plan and it's a great thing to do you know we have a lot of clients that are\nUm in retirement they've they're comfortable they have enough money to support themselves um they'll have enough income they'll have extra assets and they want to do some things for the grandkids\nGets money out of their state it can give it up to five years in in one lump sum so there's a lot of benefits to it\nAbsolutely um and it's fine for them to open a five twenty nine plan and fun to five twenty nine plan but as that child approaches\nCollege eligibility age you know by the time really before the end of their sophomore year because the financial aid calculation goes on the you know two years prior so if you're applying for financial aid for your student for you know next year twenty Nineteen it's actually based on your income from twenty Seventeen\nSo you you have to be cautious there and you definitely want in most cases that five twenty nine plan to be moved into the parent's name and out of the grandparents name and the reason why is because if it's in the um grandparents name\nAny distributions are talented as income\nTo the child in again very adversely impacts any aid whereas if it's a parent asset\nIt falls under the the um formula for assets but it's a much lower percentage then but you know five ...\nFive little over five percent for the parents but income for the students I think is counted more than twenty percent oh yeah oh yeah on the assets or you just said income assets accounted at twenty percent with the income\nIf it's considered income how much did they leave it can go up to fifty percent yeah right five twenty ninth grade in the grandparents name and it was tax deferred right but now it just could that's the way I'm In a any kind of a portion of your financial aid\nOh right absolutely if if the if if you were otherwise the you know the school says hey you know you can uh\nWe're gonna give you twenty thousand a financial aid\nAnd then um you know then the grandparents you know make a distribution they say oh here's you know ten thousand for um you know ah for Johnny's in oh\nTuition obesity well then they'll say well we're going to take five thousand away or into a basically it's almost like a fifty percent penalty on though just distribution so you want to be really careful about that as well\nUm you know there's other things like now is the time so I'd say in a really as we're running out of time here I'm One of the things to just recommend is that you you don't wait too long I'm now is the time you know be be be before the end of the year to get the fast and\nUm each school has their own college profile special deadline so you have to ... you can look those up on the the FAFSA website um and you want to\nBe ahead of the game I mean also things like\nTaking advantage of the American opportunity tax credit I'm looking into loan options and eat them in potential grants and scholarships you want to do all of that\nYou know now I'm now is the time\nUm you know if we can be a resource or ... you know we know people who were admissions experts um and understand the aid packages and you know we can help determine what student loans makes sense you know give us a call if you have questions um we might be able to help\n'em work our financial group I'm getting located at twenty Park Avenue in

I Love learning new things especially if I find something that I can put into my repertoire grab and go you know stick it in the park because it's going to take\nThe list [laughter] absolutely absolutely oh you know it's a great fall item to is pharaoh and spell so there's a lot of people are making ... so we of course are very well known for a false arrow salad which I'm just going to remind everyone case they've heard about it or not never actually tried it is [noise] pharaoh\nWalnuts roasted butter not roasted Brussels sprouts and cranberries and that's super delicious but now I think everyone's catching on his whole pharaoh thing I'd even seen it at some chain restaurants out a little side of the first\nTime I heard about her was in your restaurant where the ... ... your store were the first times I was in there I was over by where you have all of your book item\n... and I said I said I don't know I I was with Robyn my sister I said what a sparrow and you popped out of nowhere and you're like oh this is delicious and I was like I learned\nI all I Do to be normal and then sometimes I find myself just like overhearing a customer and I can't help but I have to answer their question and then they've got like ...\nThat is the perfect customer service right there because you're paying attention to their needs whether or not they realize that they soak it out loud because I have internal conversations all the time whether or not I'm Out of my head you never know still\nPharaoh is like a little almost like a little wheat berries and um it it you know it's not gluten free it as a wheat products but it looks like a weed Barry else looks just like ... kind of interchangeable and those are\nThings that I feel like until five years ago we were really hearing about and now everyone's interesting texture not use little rubbery sometimes a little rubbery but yeah I recommend you know come down to check out the grain section\nThere we sell a seven grain blend that I think has\nMaybe a wild rice I'm a short grain brown barley spelled and people have love that for their winter soups to us as I\nI think that would make a great filler because it helps soak up some of the broth in it you know without having to use like ... or getting agent after\nThe fact that we're going to take a break All right and when we come back we're going to be talking more about some of the products that you have available that you can make into delicious foods [noise] my name is\nJenny and I'm the host them WG ages talking soon Jeanie and this week we're talking\nWith Mary him hide it from an item Mediterranean marketplace and we will be right\nAnd\nWelcome back to the WTO ... talking food with at ...

Mediterranean marketplace [noise] my name is Jenny I'm the host than I Am in Studio with Merriam later from it heightens marketplace now you're listening to this show on WTO ... five eighty\nAm Ninety four nine fmri any smartphone I pat or your heart radio out on the stream some him you've brought a guest with you\nToday on you have brought a very special guest um today I have with me our why manager justice Wagner hello welcome justice\nI think Ira having me oh I'm Glad that you're here because you know I loved one\nWho doesn't writes um I I thought it was important to\nFor people to get to know justice even over the radio if you've never met him in person um because wine is something that for some reason intimidates many and I I don't know why I used to be one of those people so I I shouldn't say I don't know why but it doesn't have to be intimidating and\nIt's the season to start drinking line get back into line if maybe you had beer all summer I mean I say it's always a season for mine are for both uh but I wanted justice to give us an idea\nOf some good phone lines you know if you're going to go to somebody's house and it's the weather's getting chillier you wanted to bring something without breaking the bank right and maybe they're not a a line up to see a NATO or the person you're going to visit like what are some different winds that you would recommend\nHow did you get into why and what what drove you to be a wine connoisseur\nA I got into wind because\nWas it was just around my house all the time when I was growing up and so\nI saw my parents have it with dinner every night and I'm sent over time after I was going to graduate from school is when I was like hey I'm going to just email like fifty wineries across the whole west coast\nAnd see how to even get started so I ended up getting a job at a winery and working over there and just try and read and study as much as I possibly can for sent you\nLearned wine from the ground up literally from the vines to harvesting to fermenting the whole nine yards ... what was your favorite part of learning that\nProcess I think I Love the like just on the ground getting your hands dirty you know like thrown great bunches out and um\nYou know doing ... are all sorts of different things to ah yeah just a daddy\nVery middle that's very cool that you that you know exactly what went on what you wanted to do and you did it right from scratch I'm pretty impressed with them\nSo I Know that with the holidays coming up what are some of the winds that you recommend to people that come in that don't really get a grasp of what they're looking for that they like the taste of why but they're not sure the differences between the\nYeah 'cause I think part of the challenge with wind is that when you go up to the whole wind shelves and you see it's just a million labels and I have so many people come up to me and they're like confessed that they pick this one just because the label I'm\nI'm I'm a fan of that\nLabel cells I Know when it's when you're fighting against a hundred other labels you've got to have one that stands out yeah\nOh yeah but I was like I never blame you because yeah how on earth that you're supposed to know you have to start somewhere yeah exactly yeah um that's where I think it's incredibly important to um\nUh to ask questions if you ever have one because I think in the same way that if I ever go into a shop I was asked the person with their favorites are because they know the winds better than I Do that anyway um and then I think the other ways to try and find value\nThrough going to regions that most people don't always necessarily know about ... or something like I'm a wind that made him Portugal because it's in this unknown place that most people don't buy from can be like a third as expensive as what like a wine of equal quality would be in ...\nNow I have to say that I Am not a fan of Chilean wines I just I whatever\nThe soil acidity is really affects the flavor of the wine interest in my head I had a much if I had three wind in front of me I could pick out the Chilean wine\n[laughter] I don't know why I Can't pick out any other [laughter] yeah but I can pick out the Chilean wines it there's a a flavor or tennis or something that does not agree with me and it literally makes me make that face\nJustice can you confirm that this is the truth [laughter] that's\nSo interesting um and it's yeah it's funny that's part of what makes wine so interesting to me it's just how big the world of wine is sometimes some resonates with one person and doesn't with another person yeah I'm\nLike yes some people adore Italian winds my brother and he was just started could not stand how panic some of them were the um got Ryan out his mouth like crazy when I go yeah uh\nThere was a movie that I'm Ellen recommend within um called a bottle\nShock do have you ever seen that movie yeah okay so I really got my eyes open to the differences between the Italian the French and the domestic winds from the United states I really\nWas a great movie to educate yourself on what happens behind the scenes so I'm a big fan of that and I love Ellen recommend going to say [noise] um\nSo what are your favorites what do you recommend like say I was going to go in and I was gonna um grab the ... and bring them home and cook them what would you recommend as wind to go along with that\nI think one of my favorite recent finds that I have is this a red blend from Italy for northern Italy in the Piedmont region okay um and it's a blend of three grapes they use their um ...
