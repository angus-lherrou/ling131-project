have one that kind of like a trailer critical couple another trip around about a month ago but it got ... got caught in a composer I already at ... ... yeah I got it\nAll the good great awesome I don't know how they caught on her right now everything's green haven't water there\nAre a lot of about a week but Africa don't girls a lot of young I mean if I thought it was too much outside your water off and you know\nHow I think like Harris I order out\nI said is\nLying yeah water and he's\nThe author ... will grow at the bottom I get all these green hit the bottom of the\nIt funny\nNow we did have a few folks who noticed especially the folks who got monthly statements most of us get quarterly statements but those folks who got monthly statement saw their January statement and we're elated\nWe tend to forget that when markets or go up like that the way I like to look at it is that's not all are as we don't get to keep all of that\nBut people southern January statements and they were elated\nWhile the February statements came in and it kinda wiped out that entire gain from January but mentally we thought that was all ours so it felt like we had last part of our principal or we had last period\nAnything on a short term basis like that is relatively meaningless as a long term investor but it was interesting the number of folks who called in and my gosh I'm Down nine percent or eight percent what are we going to do and I had to point out to folks that well over two months actually break even or up a little bit\nSo long term perspective certainly helps but how about this in the last thirty nine years in twenty two of those calendar years we had to drop from the highest point to the lowest point in those years of more than ten percent twenty two\nTimes out of thirty nine years we had a drop of ten percent or more\nTwenty nine thirty eight years still had a positive return ... year end\nSo long term investors balanced portfolio diversification everything we talk about here I\nLove to think of our show is education or its financial education it's not financial entertainment and are folks who know better know that these are going to happen you look for fundamental changes maybe in the economy or that you can really put your finger on and so yeah the likelihood of this path is is very high\nYou can adjust your portfolio accordingly or but after that the whims of investors on a day to day basis is\nWe don't know why are the market will move in one direction one day versus another um you'll have everybody on TV and radio tells you they do know um but uh in the end they don't uh it's it's about being self disciplined and not making um immediate decisions based on something you think is a fact just because somebody said it\nOn TV is is a wonderful medium a great way to communicate information but just because somebody says something doesn't mean it's a fact and even when they say something that has a factual basis doesn't mean you're really getting the whole story right us consumers\nAlone you and me we represent Seventy percent of our gross domestic product Seventy percent all this concern about China\nAh has to do with trade and the price of goods and labor perhaps that we've used in China to manufacture some goods it more affordable prices\nWould it shock you learn that the Chinese market or as it relates to our GDP is less than one percent less than one percent in over all\nForeign a trade is eight percent of our GDP we still drive most of our GDP and if you consider this that house as a percentage of household income to debt\nWe're currently at nine point nine percent that's pretty good number considering our past where for example two thousand seven\nWe were at Thirteen point two percent um debt ratio income to debt ratio so it hasn't been this low the nine point nine percent since we started tracking these numbers back in Nineteen eighty\nSo it's an evidence that were probably better money managers in our personal lives we've got more ability to encourage debt if we needed to for some reason\nThe host sold net worth in the U.S\nIn two thousand seven prior to the last big crash was sixty nine trillion dollars today it's a hundred and six trillion dollars\nWhy does that matter well that's a lot more money and certainly there's been a decade of inflation modest inflation but inflation but that's a lot of money in our society when folks have some confidence we spend that money\nSo if GDP gross domestic product the measure of our economy is Seventy percent driven by our spending and we've got an extra forty three trillion dollars in net worth\nJust you know fundamentally you would think that would be a plus for our GDP and we've seen some numbers right we know our GDP year over year at the end of the second quarter is growing by two point nine percent number that the fed is comfortable with and that we're targeting\nA from a various angles various agencies and the government three percent but quarter over quarter initially grew at four point two percent\nWe don't want the economy to grow too fast you know it's the it's a the ... to haunt us wants to call this one's just write three percent is a boat just write\nToo quickly there's a whole host of things that can happen that aren't so great inflation being one of them I'm so a three percent on the ... base is right the number we're at is pretty good we've got all this cash reserve that will likely go out and spend some of that will help GDP\nHow about this we talk of an interest rates going higher and the negative impact on bonds I don't know of folks appreciate but if you step back far enough from the chart the history of yields on treasuries you would see that it's printed lower for thirty\nYears Thirty years that ten year treasuries right around three point two percent uh these days three point to do you know what the average tenure treasury yields from Nineteen fifty eight\nTo two thousand Eighteen has been six point zero five percent\nWhy does the fed want higher interest rates will certainly to slow the economy so that we don't see inflation but also because where do you cut interest rates if you're already at zero you really can't\nAnd if the fed doesn't have the ability I'm In the midst of a recession or a a normal business cycle recession that's in our future someday\nUm then there's there's really no ammunition they have to\nHelp for the soft landing that we um we talk about coming out of a market cycle like we've been in 'em and then uh giving us the stimulus as an economy to grow once we've uh we've managed through a recession so we've got a ways to go to get back to average and inflation has average to three and a half percent were well below that number\nThere's a correlation between stocks and bonds a correlation the kind of move together in some instances\nAnd if you looked at the ten year treasury able to sort of the barometer when Neal is on the ten year have been under\nFive percent we have seen on a rolling basis on a two year basis stocks perform well not a few percent of the time not fifty percent of the time were like Ninety percent of the time and we're still in that category\nThey were still well in that category\nOkay rich what happens when ten year treasuries are over five percent well it's just about the opposite I'm it certainly has arranged to remember interest rate in the seventies but once we're over five on the ten year treasury you see a a correlation of negative\nStock market performance in the U.S so\nJust some things to keep an eye on things that a good financial planning team will help you understand again it's not entertainment here screaming about the latest biotech and\nUh how it's going to come up with the newest cure for some disease you've never heard of my favorite every couple of years I've mentioned in the show before is the company that has now come up with fake blood\nAnd uh we get folks have all kinds of academic background subtle call and say I want to invest I just read about this company fake blood\nYeah no uh [laughter] is in any such thing um so um you have to be careful when you get those kinds of things because not only did they tap into your greed impulse but really though show succeed because they're entertaining\nAnd advertisers loved that they know you're going to sit there and watch and you know a frightening at the mouth about this latest stock and that's why you see the ads even on line that will say this is a guy bought a stock and it went up six thousand percent and a half an hour he's got a new pick a just click here and for forty nine dollars you can get his latest pick and\nUm it taps into our greed impulse uh it's not an appropriate weight obviously to ah to invest especially because when we deal with clients in their investments were talking about the future of their whole future their future their family's future you don't want to be running after the latest hottest thing\nYou want education you want to understand all of your options and when you consider products or strategies how about the pros and cons of each\nJust as another quick example every time there's a new twist on attack strategy that comes out we sit down and we look at it and almost always out of the gate there is some appeal right it it looks pretty good on paper you mean if you do this this this title things this way and this way you can avoid X number of dollars of taxes\nWell then you have to sit back and have the logical discussion about ...\nI Wonder if the IRS would be okay with that I mean is that the intent of the tax code to allow these six different steps to avoid those income taxes or those estate taxes probably not and it wouldn't be long before the Irish caught up with the strategy and slammed the door on it\nAnd now what do you do if you're halfway into that\nWhen you don't have an option but to unravel it sometimes costing you more money in taxes in the end\nSo uh if it's too good a right to feel like I'm I'm Talking to you are in things you already know and I'm probably have a ingrained but if it's too good to be true it's too good to be true don't let yourself get tempted um stick with educating yourself about all the factors make better decisions for you and your family\nUm avoidance um and then let's talk about some of these uh nudey products that purport to be\nNo risk only upside a tight do an index I'm In what the real story is they're not that it's necessarily not appropriate for part of a portfolio but when you really hear the whole story you realize it's not exactly as wonderful as she may have thought\nSo we're going to take another quick break I'm rich car with a car financial group and I'll be right back\nAt car

freedom show I'm rich car thanks for joining me this morning [noise]\nAh I hear there's an election coming and uh [laughter] you see the signs you see the folks out on the street corners waving well\nWhat does it mean to your portfolio well known know rocket science here right um we took a look at a these years these interim year's midterm elections are going back fifty years and uh really the year itself the county or itself with the mid term election has really been a lackluster year\nIn terms of returns they're pretty much if you took 'em an average about breaking even in years like this\nUm it is in part due to the unknown the speculating about what the outcome of the election um might mean for stocks and even more specifically industries what industries might benefit if\nDemocrats were doling out that the do or or what industries my benefit if it's Republicans you probably have an answer right on top of your head right it's not a a rocket science here is some uh an aspect of it that's much more entertaining [laughter]\nExciting than it's ever been you remember brags it you remember how the um the international Monetary Fund came out in a very public interview the day before the vote instead of hundred economists from around the world of decided that Britain will not exit\nThe euro zone it would be catastrophic economically for them and they've all signed this uh this letter saying that they are short will not happen and brags that happened\nOkay there might have been another election a couple of years ago where the outcome predicted in fact the opposite was predicted and it seemed like a lock\nAnd President Trump was elected we are in a period a populist up period\nA where a lot of times the outcomes um are impossible to predict in what seems likely is not what in the end is um is the outcome so here we go traipsing in the midterms and what does everybody saying\nLooks like the house will go Democrat\nIf there is a split in Washington and we know this well usually there's a deadlock usually we see a nothing progressing and it's not typically good or for the stock market here is one caviar from for me personally all interject\nIs that I think if Democrats did take the house there is one aspect\nOf the economy that might do well\nAnd that might have to do with infrastructure\nBecause both Democrats and Republicans want infrastructure they want to spend money back in their districts in their states um because that gets them reelected and everybody's sort of on board with that how they divvy up that money is certainly a a more difficult discussion but\nI'm splitting up a executive branch and legislative blend branch a can make for some stagnant years so if the house goes Democrat what could happen maybe not much by way of stock market a movement maybe an overreaction in the days that follow\nThe election and it's typically a non event when you look back a week later it's an overreaction and we return right back to where we were\nUm but if Republicans held on to the house and Senate this isn't a political commentary by the way I'm only looking out for your investments in your portfolio if they held on to both well the dollar will probably go up in value against foreign currencies stocks will probably go higher\nAnd what happens when stocks are looking more attractive than bonds people sell their bonds they buy their stocks are more stocks so with that happening bond prices go down and yields go up\nSo uh keep an eye on the midterms keep an eye on what the what the long term\nEffect will be on the economy likely effect on the economy and then more specifically perhaps what industries might benefit and how can you use them in in ah in your portfolio nowadays targeting an industry has become very easy\nYou don't get the whole upside\nOkay the value of the account doesn't go down when the market goes down but how does that really work have you put pencil and paper and figured this out I'm going to tell you how it works and give you a little bit more details again not the worst thing in the world but better that you understand it before you sign because often these types of things come

try our new nine green we Jimmy ... yeah [noise]\nAll right I'm running up against the hour here and I promised you a little bit more information on these index annuities rich car here on the financial freedom show\nIndex annuities they purport to track an index and usually the one we're used to hearing is the U.S and the five hundred a couple of factors right you you go up when the index goes up you can't lose a couple of factors that might shed a different light on it a little bit is number one will be either cap how much you can earn in a good year at five or six percent let's say\nUm and uh they uh it might give you ... what's called a participation rate are saying that you can only uh participate in forty percent of the upside of the index\nUm the good news is yeah you don't lose money when the market goes down but if you looked at the history of the stock market and you have a minimum of a five year commitment and these things\nOne of those years is going to be down so if you kept at six percent you could make great if you made six percent in those other four years of a five year period because the average is still better than you would have gotten in a CD or a fixed rate annuity these days\nWhat happens if it's not one of two of those years are down\nNow the risk is not to your principal at the risk is too you're the opportunity cost what could you of earned in a CD\nOne other thing to keep in mind is another flavor of these things is where there's a bond there is a managed fund let's call it a mutual fund it was a mutual fund and the company says we'll give you a hundred percent of the return of that mutual fund with no downside\nWhich sounds kind of appealing well how long do I have to commit for seven years you know like I don't know okay we'll give you a hundred and ten percent of the return of that fund with no downside well now that sounds pretty good who manages the mutual fund dun dun dun it's the insurance company or the bank so\nIt's not like you can pick your own mutual fund of course so what happens if we're getting to the end of that seven year period and the fund has done better than the bank can afford I don't know what happens but if you got the Fox watching the hen house and they're managing the fund themselves that magic\nThe fund return might not do as well in that last year huh so that it can get back down to the level or that the bank can afford\nLook if it's too good to be true it is if you find yourself looking at one of these things go to somebody who's going to give you the pros and cons straight across the board if you get up from a seminar at dinner seminar and you are fraud and get them out because you just heard about something that is so good you can't wait to buy it something's wrong so uh\nKeep that in mind it's common sense but we're good source of information we're educating our clients so they make better decisions for themselves and for their family if we can help you five oh
