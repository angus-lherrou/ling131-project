{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Who are the countries that are going to be affected by this the most I Know Arlen like I said could see triple a prices of beer but we're all the other countries and then where does the U.S fairness the northern Europe is\nGets the biggest hit because they will have to import than most barley to make the beer and\nThe U.S consumption drops in price goes up but not as much as other places because barley production starts moving north into Canada further so we don't lose as much supply a early is imported and exported widely and that was the corporate as a model but you know it really helps in terms of price to have a stuffed nearby\nWhat's been the reaction from other groups or you know beer trade groups I Know the brewers association was one of them that said hey you know this is the ap academic exercise don't believe all the hype nothing to lose sleep over and they also say you know the farmers would be adapting as things would happen to you know the shift\nBar the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields but so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nYou summarize the beer industry is reaction pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought and the Pacific northwest last year that affected Brawley production and so we're all\nAware of this and worrying about it and that's all nice but some of the people who look at sort of large scale farming say that you know these are changes are going to be happening on continent wide scale and that is going to affect crops when you have drought and heat waves we can engineer for\nThings like drought resistance but that actually might change the nutrient profile of the barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can editor for drought resistance but hate resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on in the barley that make\nEarly early and so that's why you have to move north to harm it and you know you run\nOut of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops so the people who study these things on ... agricultural economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people like beer and the industry is pretty innovative won in some way so you know maybe if they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said I'm not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories on the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween that I Love to get every year\nThe one that caught my attention this past week\nWas that a child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery there was this eerie discovery they may found it was the skeleton of a ten year old\nThat had a rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child is way because they were afraid it was gonna come back to life and continue to spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university that Stanford\nWent on this gig in Italy and they found this\nChild cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic\nRoman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about it like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with his mouth open and stuffed inside was a limestone rock\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child\nDied as malaria sixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this catalyst they ... they ... already dead they opened\nThe mouse forcefully shaved the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impressions right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this ... like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called London properly they bend beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in his burial site you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in the trenches they're dirt cover trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents total bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient lay of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and I I don't know how this would apply to children but that had violated society's rules and the name of empire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the day that thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were rituals I rarely if he didn't say they were dumped honey cycle all over the place and these are just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these spirits would just pass along and not come back\nWe don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains of a three year old girl they found\nThat said that her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because it's Roman Empire section was considered to be a cesspool of diseases and they spread it through\nContaminated food and water and swam the so they're a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nIs not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire burials yeah in northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a brick in her mouth almost the same thing like ... you know\nThe shape rock but this was a British huge too that she was dubbed the vampire of Venice in England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone so it just seemed like that was one of the population methods are popular rituals to keep them from being able to come back from\nA and actually translated into a building that that works first and foremost as a baseball venue but also to fulfill all the pope some promises that we've made to the community about what it's going to be in terms of authentic Worcester connected to the neighborhood\nA catalyst for development um we don't want something that you could go there and say oh yeah I saw something similar and you know city acts or city why we want something that people who really\nYou know gravitate to as unique and authentic to west or an is pushing the envelope on what AAA uh ballparks can be and [noise]\nYou know the level of international\nYou know talent that was drawn to submit a proposals for the architectural design element of this um we can't go wrong no matter who we picked that's going to be degrees and how kind of much we want to push the envelope in terms of the concepts that we're able to employ here um\nAnd one other thing I should mention too that the it's not all going to be done in back rooms so we're getting ready to announce the next day or two with the team a schedule for fan engagement\nUm where they literally going to go throughout the city each city council district and they want to talk to folks about what they want to see in this ballpark in excruciating detail from literally from\nYou know the family change in Rome what do you want to see do you want diaper tables and they are do you want you know particular type of a a quote from ... to a seats to vending stations they really want to engage with the fans ... how do you want the seats to feel look\nEt cetera because they want this to be something that really works for the people who are going to use it to people going to pay for the tickets are so it's not going to be a fly by not going to be a sending a quick survey it's going to be real sincere engagement\nAh with the community about how we build this fall\nAt this point how much is I'm with you know and it's a real easy with you\nA very closely so through the uh interviews for both the on this project manager as well as the um architect\nIt was the city team that was in there and it was lucky you know it was January Smith it was most of their key staff who sat there for two solid days are they probably are sixteen Eighteen hours or more of listening to the presentations asking questions you\nKnow kind of clarifying saying so they're putting a lot of time and then they're hearing a very you know engaged to a matter of fact I was telling Paul I talked to Larry over the phone over the weekend in about the pros and cons of a couple of the\nArtist and he was going following up having coffee with a couple of them that have a studios in the Boston area to see this studio see what they look like kind of get a feel for them so um this is something that I Do I'm going to do right\nRight if I\nIf I asked that we work as a team and we have common interests here\nOr can make this be the best they can be for the neighborhood we need [noise] it's it's more than just a ballpark is the manager said this is part of the neighborhood\nWe want people to go eat lunch sitting around there we want to make it to be like a um Larry Keane likes to say minor league ballparks apart amusement park we want playgrounds we want things around it to keep it alive even when there's\nNothing going on and we want the public to be able to walk the concourse uh [noise] you know most ... minor league ball price one of the architects and you know depends berries a little bit about three times around the conquest is a mile and people can go there and at lunchtime do their three laps or something like that we wanted to be\nPart of it in the neighborhood not just locked up other than the one is an event\nYeah that that's why I think it's so exciting yeah yeah it really is and you know the whisker element to it you've got the\nInside of the car costs will have your traditional food vendors but the outside that with the the field as the backdrop I saw this down in Nashville they had old campers and trucks that hollowed out and they have specialty food vendors operating out of there we've talked about doing that was Mr diners\nSo having the Old West or diners that have the names on it throughout the conquest and you can get a specialty food\nItem and you know I'm just filling in as the boulevard\nDoes you know the ...\nOr whatever it may be along the concourse overlooking the ballparks or feels again like western edge over the U.S or they were all may exactly they were made here and there are a big part of our neighborhoods out big part of our history so kind of a paying tribute to them and integrating them into this new modern facility rushing up\n[noise] so one of the big thing is that and I want to call that come in and talk a little bit about is integrated planning which is far less sexy or than building a new ballpark but very germane to the pocket books to the people of oyster or\nWhether they be uh you know property owners themselves or rent just somebody's paying a water to a bill or if you live in the city of ... or or you or a business operating in the city of worse to somebody's paying the city of ... or a water sore bell\nAnd you know we've worked really hard and before I got here uh Paul and his of previous boss Bob Boilen and Michael Brian and others\nReally led the charge to try to fight 'em some of the the about permitting um requirements that were being handed down from the EPA\nOr as unworkable or in terms of the cost to they will go into um past have to pass onto the\nRate payers in the city of West or are we all share the goal of wanting a clean environment we want you know to make sure we're doing our fair share to make sure that what we put back into the rivers and streams of of Massachusetts as clean as it has to be but we don't want to be chasing you know I'm unrealistic goals\nUh when we can be doing other things that will have a bigger impact on the quality of the environment so\nNow we've been able to convince the EPA do allow us to try this integrated plant approach um\nWhich has led us to make the case to the EPA that we can\nYou know accomplish some very important um goals in terms of the environment but doing it more affordable way and do it in a longer term way uh I think it's a fifty year plus plan\nA that we really need the public to validate through a public process and we had one hearing willing to do another one on November race and we want to get the public kind of engage this conversation because it's very germane to the people in the city\n[noise] yeah I joined in fact just give you a little background about two years ago now asked\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan that is right for\nCall it today in letting it get started\nSouthern course offerings will be made only offering circular which has been found within qualify by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs of ...\n[noise]\n\n\nThe uh the squeezes Marilyn or terrifying attractions in one location designed to skiing\nThis audio is for your review Internet postings for distribution other ... copy quality original property media Washington DC\nOptimal health introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more likely to go family care dot com that's go family cared dot com or call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from after my health\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nMean it's hard to tell you it's a way where he was a city\nManager and foremost as you can measure republic we're talking about the EPA in a in a half a structure and in the working relationship from the city is now develop the EPA just see if we can avoid catastrophic expenditures that would have\nBeen absolutely prohibited in it I think Paul as you said you weren't even finished with\nThe licensure for the first base and they came back and then bang just to get it's correct and there were ... you know people don't realize what you mean wander in ... right now are relatively cheap compared to other humanities towards the Boston area\nAnd we want to try to keep them affordable you know people get a lot of bills to pay they're paying their taxes they're paying their water sewer all the other utilities and you know we know we got a lot of folks shore senior citizens on fixed incomes and you know we want to be sensitive to their cost of living um and try to do what we can to keep it down\nI didn't pause you just tell people I don't think people realize this gulp and the scale of this thing like the number of miles of pipes that make up our our water or sewer system the number pump stations\nThe sewer system in water systems probably Thirteen hundred miles a pipe\nI'm fully a third of its over a century old I'm On the suicide it's more than that the water strides in better condition because even some of the old pipe say go back to the Eighteen hundreds but over the years they've been relying we'd been lining since back in the eighties so the water system generally terms of distribution the pipes\nAre between water and sewage is forty to pump stations ah Worcester is a city of skills which requires all those pumps stations in different pressure systems we have ten reservoirs all outside\nThe city and there's a substantial number of dams and and you know infrastructure related to the reservoirs and of course we've got the filtration plant\nThere was built in response to when we used to have more quality drinking water and now we have some of the best in New England but that is Twenty years old and we have in the back yeah Twenty years I'm ... right now during the ozone system over because not serviceable anymore and you know over the next decade or two and a half to upgrade parts that\nI'm not and we didn't have potable water we couldn't for water on airplanes yeah right it didn't pass federal standard it out on it is now but we did the water filtration\nYeah we were the brunt of jokes back down I mean that was unnecessary expenditures that still paying dividends to the community that we have reliable safe drinking water is just one of the things they say you know\nIt's one of the things you have the luxury of taken for granted and we're still you put the cap on you know think twice about it just go or they've been documentaries and stuff written about Flint, Michigan or you look at what it's like to try to sell your house in Flint, Michigan\nTalking about economic development there is none when you don't have water that people feel it's safe to drink\nOh my God nothing else cops nothing else can ... what is it was written\nUp or not it was an issue but I remember when I was there we read that ... I mean to a fairy shrimp and we ought to know um they don't work ah actually these little\nMicro swimming around in your water ... I mean you do and he went through the city you know what you eat and drink it and also it uh it didn't pass federal standards yeah we didn't want to spend this kind of money we were fighting with each other so it's like\nA you know it was probably the one of the best things we ever did it a huge and had to remind me that I Know we were actually clash university at that time they just some studies with the city a washer and conscious I ... I was chair public works at that time when we started the whole reminding from um now he's a big step forward\nAnd we were actually still doing it but all the major pipes it done but we're still doing probably for a million a year in in New mainstream and relying on aging process law yeah but that that a filtration plant we knew at the time was the right thing to do is a big investment\nBut it it's paid dividends all these years and will continue to pay dividends because we can attract\nEconomic expansion without reliable safe water\nIn ... right and you think about who some of our biggest customers are the people who employ a lot of folks polar beverage\n... Abdi gab these probably one of our biggest water customers are a lot of the ... a sector is very heavily reliant on water and sewer usage we've got a whole new by a manufacturing ... we will she coming over\nBuilding their first manufacturing outside of China in Worcester um we need to have these kinds of services to expand our tax base great those jobs so\nEverything is is linked together and that really is the argument that we're making\nAffordability is a critical part of making sure the system can sustain itself there'll be have enough people can actually pay the bill price will go right back\n[noise]\n\n\n\nCity manager\nAnd the ... with us a mushroom Lucy oh gee [noise] have the uh yeah ... ... and everything else a yes or because there's so much in public rush that I had to be talking about building a ballpark subtly infrastructure but uh\nOh there's the aspect of the code all these things being killed in a ... let me ask you a couple of questions maybe outside of the realm here maybe fall and helpless when there's a courthouse you know what else you know I don't see anything happening down there\nYou you're gonna see stuff at the end of the year probably in December so they are about two months ago got what they were really anxious for is the historic tax credit allocation their first allocation about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars [noise]\nUm [noise] you know we sold at last December a to them so they actually been paying taxes to the city\nUm we did a bunch of the clean up the one element of the cleanup or that we held money in reserve but we were waiting to do with them at the windows or the windows a historic so they need to be maintained but the window clocking our have PC bees and other things in it so\nWe need to take them out we wanted to do it in concert with the developer so when we took them out they were doing whatever other kind of work they're replacing them re mediated [noise] um I think\nThey're developer the construction company might want to do it in a different schedule so we're talking that through but you should start to see actual work or ran around the end of the year on the court house uh and it was this historic tax credit allocation which was the big thing that they were waiting for how much a voice what\nAre the boys club or waiting for the city council to take up and they sent it to the economic development the committee's recommendation that um I said to them that we sell the boys club\nFor three hundred thousand to wind development [noise] um when development within a duo at least with cement academy which is a program for kids with autism going right up to the college age level\nUm Wynwood redevelop it\nAnd then release it to them that's important because when as a for profit they would pay taxes on the property or and have a well lease a that would be paid to win\nA we had a number of parking issues we needed to work out the whim church next door worked with us the city kind of recon figured a few things to squeeze out a few more parking places so they'd have the sufficient parking", "show_name": "Best of Jim Polito & Jordan levy", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "21"}
