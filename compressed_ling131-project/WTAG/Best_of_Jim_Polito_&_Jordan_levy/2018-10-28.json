{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "[noise] [laughter]\nThis has to be my favorite story of the week I'm a Southern California guy I grew up here and I love Disneyland I Love going there\nIt is one of the happiest places on the earth and we found this article on Wall Street Journal about the big secret that Disney World and Disneyland have\nThat it's a favorite spot for people to scatter the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tribute said you could have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ashes spread it isn't and where would you have them spread it\nProbably Indiana Jones because that's my favorite\nRight I Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything I worried they're going to sweep you at the end of the night that's what happens actually so\nWe spoke to ... he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes in they spread them out in different places Disneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to\nHave it be their final resting place oh here's ... with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me to it without that I ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense that someone want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for it or they say it's a habit cleanup so\nIf you are a worker who sees what you suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a habit clean up and that means\nYou need to grab the hypo allergenic vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will suck them up in a vacuum and clean it up while everyone you know leaves the premises and goes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency\nWere talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading\nThese ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's earn in the hotel bathroom\nInto a pill bottle that she could then smuggle path park security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ... that that's gone through security as well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the rights particularly dark so no one sees\nThem other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade\nSurrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass flinging them she ran and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of sit there and I just saw the you know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn for a ashes doesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine\nHow many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking\nTo custodians that consensus that I arrived that would that have happened about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more frequently heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I think the ... says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing [noise] you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nProbably it was one of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by and and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the spread these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter] I Love the quote someone said that the hunted mentioned probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that\nIt's one of those places obviously we know what the hundred mentioned right is all about spooky and what not and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be the I'm going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the I think\nI heard so many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes have been spread all over these parks the hunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean\nReally if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there and I don't quite know why they ... the haunted mansions is so I mean obviously it's on theme break for the practice but in talking to people who work in the hot I mentioned they describe just to sort of general obsession among certain fans\nWith the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark and there are a lot of places where you can sort of an conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating a cleaning it up\nThey'll close them rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've always seen rides closed for technical difficulties before it could be something mechanical but this is also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nIt says a process that will kick start on rights like the haunted mansions so stay around comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises do radio over for ... clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will head out fast passes\nTo people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they say the right to have to shut down and you have to leave you got to give him something wrong with people are going to get upset so then the the vacuum in come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look and see like are there any\nAshes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these ride like on pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty simple place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween Eric ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hundred mansion please call me so I can do a follow up it definitely was a great thank you\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the daily diet every Monday through friday joined us on social media at daily diet pot on Twitter and daily podcast on please\nYeah the guards Churchill and got the sort of scrutiny is he really did not a sympathizer either for that guy at all no but I Know that like I said\nYeah I I'm I'm not either oh of course for me to be fired by ESPN is kind of a badge of courage\nUh as far as I'm concerned but you know the the folks from the red Sox talk about talk about backpedaling I mean man it's like they're going there they're going backwards for a pop up fly into into the center field wall that's that's how much they're back pedaling\nThe ... originally they said oh we just invited to players\nAnd then you know other people called and said hey they can be part of it and you know I never got around to Curt Schilling\nCome on\nYou know what you know what it really does it really bothers me because the red Sox around the cost of a of a World Series championship right now\nAnd to just pull this crap you know changed the name of yucky way by the globe make it even more or less the radical ... and and this kind of stuff\nAnd it just it really it's like you know what guys are you trying to make me not like you\nAre you really trying to make me not like you I understand\nProtecting your product and and the Boston Red Sox are a product just like the show is\nBut come on\n... what did they think we're going to happen people are gonna boo Curt Schilling\nIs that is that what they were worried about save that would be working in a blue courage owing or we don't we didn't want to be associated with his ...\nWe have we don't want to we are right we we don't really agree with what he stands for and so that's why we're we're not which is again putting yourself ahead of\nLove and suppliers everybody involved and the thing it's it's all about the red Sox you know that they put their own personal politics and priorities ahead of everything else that's going on which is annoying typically yeah it's very annoying\nI mean look at the place the guide deserves in history of course\nYou know as Johnny Damon would say what was it in the middle for we're just a bunch of what was it idiots idiot idiot yeah we're just a bunch of idiots but Curt Schilling went out there and yeah the bloody sock and even though what did he sell it after that or something you know I Can't remember but he went out there and he had a bloody sock that was a real\nThat was up a a a such a a representation if you want to know what that year was like for the Sox like a bloody sock and he still pitch and what was it what did they done staple some tendon back together and his ankle\nYeah they had some suitors and staples down and then they thought that goes to the game it didn't hold\nAnd they ripped and he's playing any still you know he still throwing rockets over the plate\nCome on [noise] you know it's interesting to look at it like you know everybody gets the NFL is such a hard time for putting the politics and into it and I\nI think this might be a little bit different in terms of this has nothing to do with the players like if you're thinking to yourself I don't want to watch the red Sox anymore because their owner is you know X Y and Z that's fine but\nI Will say that I don't think this has anything to do with a monkey bats and David Price and Chris Sale and all the other oh no on the team that have gotten them to this point you know so it is to me important to separate the two and you know you can still tell John Henry I feel about him but still be able to watch the\nGame and oh no no no no no right right I'm not I'm not turning away from the game this is not this is about actually the owners and hey don't get me wrong I I'm Upset with the ...\nNFL not saying hey guess what guys stand up you know ... and ... and then do a little too little too late over the summer\nThey put the new rule in but no this is was John Henry like this is a kind of anger that people had with um [noise] uh you know the Yankees organization under George Steinbrenner\nOur country realizes nine dollars in benefits through increased earnings and decrease reliance on safety net programs well if that's true if we can get a nine hundred percent return on our investment\nCan we put a trillion dollars into head start\nI mean if I came to you and said I've got an investment here and you ... you're going to get you're going to make nine hundred percent on your money when you'd be a fool not to invest or well wait a minute [laughter]\nWho would be the fool because when you say a gym that doesn't make any sense how am I going to make nine hundred percent on this\nHe's saying just like this is the common refrain Nancy Pelosi said remember when she talked about food stamps and welfare\nHow much economic for every dollar spent on food stamps I don't know what the government gets like three to four or five dollars back really that doesn't make any sense how can you hear something like that and then say oh that's great\nThat's like in Nineteen eighty four of the the the story Nineteen eighty four by George Orwell\nTell people that and tell them that it's great and you just don't use any logic to think about it one other thing in this\nThe typical McGovern typical Richie Neal um he says head start is one of the best programs we have for breaking the cycle of poverty\nNo it isn't\nNo no see it is not you know one head start is\nHead start is this\nYou created the welfare state with the great society with Johnson\nAnd so you made families less and less responsible for their old children you even incentivized\nFathers to be absentee gonna break up the family\nAnd now this is your fix for right [noise]\nAnd let's talk about breaking the cycle of poverty Jim McGovern you opposed\nThe program at the worst or housing authority developed by re Mariano a fellow Democrat someone who grew up in public housing you opposed his program that was voluntary that help to get people out of public housing\nThat\nAs long as they went to work and their kids went to school they could stay in public housing and money would be saved for them but if they didn't do that they were out you said I Can't participate in the program that tosses people out of public housing\nWell then watch the incentive to leave public housing\nSo don't put out a press release with your friends from the community action council and talking about how this is a this is going to break the cycle of poverty where all that this does this contributes to what perpetuates the cycle of poverty [noise]\nYou're listening to the
