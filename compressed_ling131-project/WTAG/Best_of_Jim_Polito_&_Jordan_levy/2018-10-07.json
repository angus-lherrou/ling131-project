{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Kind of destroying these muscles how's it been ordering the ant\nOut of the colony and this is\nReally eliminate research but what they're thinking is that it was actually acting as a kind of\nNervous system of itself so it's actually replacing the nervous system of the ... so it might be releasing narrow transmitters that mimic those of the ants owned by to actually manipulate individual muscles so it's like a puppet master\nPulling strings and it's just it's stunning how this could have involved but it probably happened small step by small step it started more simple than that of course but these extra manipulations help the fungus propagate itself to get into more ants and that's what led to the developing this extremely complex\nManipulation but nevertheless is happening\nI can guarantee you that that's happening it's real life you know it's happening out there in nature\nNow it's kind of crazy it takes about three weeks for the fungus to grow with inside the end\nAnd you talked about how I mean it's so crazy how delicate this procedure is because you know aunts live in this colony when they noticed something is amiss in another end sicker stumbling are acting weird\nAnother ... will literally come and take it pick it up and throw it down to its death you know away from the colony protecting the colony so the fungus has to be very careful that it doesn't trigger something weird in the end that it it's going to trigger one of the other answer and suspected of being some type of intruder\nSo how does that work how does the funniest delicately move around this because at the very end as you said when it makes it go bike the leaf or the tree branches something that's the point that takes over the brain kind of but before that the end is still operating normally in within the colony\nYeah that that's a really incredibly about and you know I don't want to to the short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happened\nTo be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals before they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of at a path to the fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years and ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so that scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical and so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of missing out bad actors\nIn the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact that they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably started out pretty sort kills the ... in the colony but that might get it found out in that would get it dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you you just stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive its host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms in the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree [laughter] so you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex because the ant colony is it self extremely complex and able to sniff out the sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball\nTo avoid detection and really pull off this\nTest downing like complex devious and manipulative\nAnd that's how we get this zombie I mean he it's so delicate that process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus has a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight leaf and everything it's just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in South Carolina I think uh we have at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of at least that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of elite but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the street the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a purchase your ticket have purchased on the vein of elite biting into it so it actually happens here in the United states as as the\nFungus there's ordering the ... to bite onto the flag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then it orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that stamp and that's just all the more power to to\nPurchase there and you know get a good grasp because\nIn the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will over winter just sitting there on the stem biding his time and then once the spring comes around at will then finally a rough out of the back of a head\nThe ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world\nFungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin that day you have the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead so about the book\nYeah though that turns out that the fungus is just one of the\nMany many manipulators among parasite and the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species the worm do it to cricket their war or to the cricket the jump into water which is not of course ... the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then ...\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation\nRabies actually is a very well known parasitic manipulated that does it usually the raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so the book is about the wide range of parents sites the\nReally incredible range of parents I more than you'd ever imagine that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique ways whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering\nStructures in the brain so called by living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration hope is very strange kingdom a species that are are really ruining the days and they're\nJust reading about the ants in itself is so interesting so thank you very much Matt Simon staff writer at wired author of plight of the living dead check out the book thank you for joining us\n[noise] [noise]\nAll right and that's it for us this week and be sure to check out the daily diet every Monday through friday\nJoined us on social media daily diets hot on Twitter daily podcast on these [noise]\nLeave us a comment give us a rating and tell us your stories that you're interested in\nOf the daily dive and I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your aka\nThe daily dive is produced by random er into an engineered by Tony Soren Tina I'm Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\nBowed [noise]\nHealing for Senate and strengthening the legitimacy of the Supreme Court I'm camp who sales Fox News that's the focus for Senate Democrat Chris Coons following the contentious confirmation process to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nThat Senate role in our in our politics is not to just reflect the country but to help heal and leave the country and that of course we should be on\nThe Congress and the Senate\nNothing his victories were in the courts\nAnd through executive order that was it that was hit I mean he may have been a popularly elected president but when it came to his agenda\nWhat did he get done\nIn a lasting way\nNothing other than Obamacare and that was done on a procedural trick it was we all know it was\nWhat did he get done\nNothing\nThe liberal agenda the less agenda does not stand up to voters why\nBecause the average voter says on some of the crazy stuff they come up with that doesn't make any sense to me I felt that people are hateful and\nRacist it's just people say a lot of liberal stuff they say that doesn't make any sense I'm not going to go with that\nSure there are enclaves throughout the country where one of them we got the tofu courting around a north Hampton cameras from that area and of course in one twenty\nEight east got the tofu curtain\nFrom the rest of the state and get people saying that doesn't make any sense to me don't get that\nThat's the problem now next step\nAnd we're going to get to build them for our national correspondent who will lay out just where we're going to be over the next forty eight hours how it's going to work\nBut Justice John Paul Stevens who's Ninety eight years old and I knew until I read this last night I didn't realize she was Ninety eight I knew you were retired I knew he was old but Ninety eight years old he had supported\nBrett Kavanaugh previously he'd actually I think he had mentioned Brett Kavanaugh on one of his books talking about a decision\nThat came out of the D.C court of appeals the cabinet authored and said this guy would be great for the Supreme Court now John Paul Stevens is saying he doesn't have the temperament\nTo be a member of the Supreme Court really okay jump ... let me ask you this question let's take you\nDuring your confirmation hearing\nAnd subject due\nTo what Brett Kavanaugh\nHad to put up with\nWhat subject due to what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with\nAnd see how you react\nI don't think that as anything to do with your temperament he's got three hundred decisions and how could you say that his three hundred decisions were sounding good and this guy should be on the Supreme Court then you see I'm Upset because his name was dragged through the mud\nHow could you\nSay he doesn't have the temperament I Would say that if he didn't react that way\nNow granted he went a little overboard and himself in the wall Street Journal piece yesterday said I got a little too emotional\nOkay we've got a little too emotional nobody ever said that about any of his uh decisions did you see anyone earlier\nThrough the process of his confirmation until they tried to sneak listen\nThis is this a sex assault allegation did anybody say a you're a little too emotional and your rulings did you remember hearing that during the during the hearings no you don't because it didn't happen\nBut John Paul Stevens said last at all I don't think he has a let's put you up against that and see how you react not not as a Ninety eight year old man but when you were younger let's see how you react to it which brings me to another point the media\nNBC has has published\nAnonymous accusations against Brett Kavanaugh like like no no verification no core operation nothing and yet NBC was the same network\nThat wouldn't publish Ronan Farrow Z story on Harvey wind\nTo have a good weekend\nYou too Bye bye John is another example of why or even if you move away\nYou can stay in touch with us the ... radio apt you can listen to the show anywhere I Know my friend Jimmy Brossard is down in uh\nConnecticut right now\nListening because he's out of the area and a out of the range of WHYY enemies still picking us

Schumer is not one of my favorite comedians I didn't see\nTrain wreck um what's the deal\nUh well it's funny how we actually saw her at the mass neutral center last year when she performed and like
