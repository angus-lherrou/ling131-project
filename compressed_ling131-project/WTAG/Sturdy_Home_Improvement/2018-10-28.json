... we're here to help you triple the plan requests AAA seven five to six seven forty two on line at rice on the dot com [noise]\nFolks are slow to respond because they're overwhelmed with their own business you know there's they don't have enough people working for them um there's there's a lot of folks calling for estimates are they don't have enough guys to get out and maybe it's themselves to go out and see them um and then once the wants to\nSail does come into the books how do we get it done because ah it's kind of happening from the bottom up meaning if there's an eight man roof crew and three of the guys leave to go make more money somewhere else because it's all available then that that hurts that crew so the problem with this kind of set up\nIs what you end up seeing John and where I'm going with is is that you end up getting lower level workers leapfrogging\nThe position that they should be in meaning if you have an apprentice that should be in a low to mid level carpenter range he's now jumping because he's allowed to jump and they shouldn't but he's allowed to jump in say Mr and Mrs homeowner I'd be happy to build that deck for you\nAnd your lead carpenter when you've only been a helper on deck building and\nMr and Mrs homeowner now receive\nA poorly constructed deck yes because he thought it was okay to to jump ahead and I guess I don't blame them because it's opportunity\nBut in the end everybody gets hurt so I went on I Want everyone to to give us a call here and let us know your experience who've had this happen where you thought you were hiring someone that told you they can handle everything and then once it happened it was like whoa you're not a professional at all\nWell that's a triple down ... trickle down effect that um\nWhere you know you you better a practice for two years and all of a sudden you think you can you can do the job now so you go to ... you talked like you said talk to the homeowner you give the home or a great place to do the job but you only get to a certain ... at a certain level of expertise and then you then you tumble\nSo we do a lot of condominium work on roofing projects and siting projects you know we've been experiencing this um pain in the roofing industry\nAnd basically we've got you know on a on a given job you might have a ... man ten men twelve and crew in the old days yes and they'd be off at ... seven eight great Schindler's out there will now it's it's a little bit\nIt's diminished the ... the size and the quality that you can get there so we've been forced to be honest with\nLarge accounts that we've had for many many years to say hey listen I'm just going to be honest with you read the papers looking at magazines there's a there's a skilled labor shortage out there so I Know you're frustrated with the production of how fast this is going\nBut I at one of their option I can ... I can bring in another crew\nThat's not going to do the right job\nAnd and I'm going to end up having to fix a lot of things that that are done and done wrong here or we can wait be a little bit more patient and make sure that we're using the quality harassment on the job\nAnd it's going to take a little bit longer is that okay with you 'cause that's really are are only option yes and we're getting some pretty good response but you got to be honest with folks and let them know ahead of time that that's just what it is right now\nUm and if you're if you're saying it's any different way\nI I I don't know where you're getting your help because it's not it doesn't it doesn't exist\nEither that or you're not busy enough to correct about that a scenario\nNo doubt no doubt which is also troubling because in this market\nIt it's almost impossible not to be a ... and again we always said the old the old adage you which is\nIf in a busy market if you don't and you're a small guy that only handles one job at a time if you don't have a backlog that's a couple of months long what kind of work or you die\nOr give us a call your eight hundred three three one nine for nine six eight hundred three three one nine for nine six we want to hear from you and give us a an opinion again have you had contractors come to your house bid the job have you're hired someone and then say oh jeez you know we were shocked that this is taking place in terms of\nYou know we thought we were getting something different because\nYou know that's what you said yeah and a ... and you know that's where you really got to do your research and you got to see not only is that company down that work but who's gonna beyond my job\nWell this is the time you don't over promise on the job you permit to the schedule you three to four weeks out a customer service will give you a college you know exactly what time the job is going to be started\nWhat was the difference here saying don't over promise the timeframe agreed but we're we're not going out under promise\nThe the commitment of level of quality the quality of all the animals that sometimes we're saying folks it might have to wait three weeks when normally we'd be there and a week so we appreciate our our our clients being a little bit patient but again\nYou've waited this long to do the project yes let's do it correctly and make sure that we have quality ... time\nLeft in the season they get a job done you know even though we're into the end of October he got the Halloween coming up the thirty first a lift\nIt feels ... I I'm In my mind them in November because the weather is felt like no yeah yeah right it's it's funny I almost like December you know in some ways it's sad that cold chill um and uh you know a lot of cold rain and things like that\nThe early morning in cold weather Adam ... early morning frost than and warmed up to fifty five sixty your appreciative of the of the temperature of fifty five sixty

little differently especially on especially on all remodeling where to cover in with a covering the aluminum around the ... and given given it a nice clean look yeah you know and uh\nThis is this is this is very important because it can save you five to seven thousand dollars on a job sure if you're if you're going that route if this new construction hardy board and PVC to all the way but if you do or we mowing job\nMaybe ... ... especially with the brick malls around the windows you got crawl moving up in Gable ends you want to leave dad give it a nice clean look\nA little little stuff like when you say novelty jobs but like jobs that are particular you know he's got an old uh\nVictorian home you know you you know built late Eighteen hundreds in the early Nineteen twenties you know these kind of homes and you end up with a with a house that\nWhen you strip off three layers of roof shingles that are up there\nAnd he's got cedar shakes you're going to leave a little bit of a of a dent there and it's going to have to be repaired and we're going to put a ... a ... up there are we gonna or we're gonna sock to thin the the er the cedar shakes we're going to have to have some sort of repair in line and if you don't say that that's going to happen right and you're just setting yourself over ...\nWill shame shame I knew for not letting people know especially if you have the experience and knowledge of of the three layer for Les ... strip roof and you know that this final signing or a little no sign on top of that yeah that once you strip it down you're gonna lose two and a half inches right and these are you take the signing off or put some type of ah\nOf role flashing up\nThere or whatever we're going to take our first break here we come back we'll take your phone

the powerful enough [noise] don't waste register online it only\nLasts helped him are ten times for babies like high up with one or very thin signed up today at ... dot org\nAnd we're back you listen to trust house call my name's Adam Lucy I'm ... give us a call this morning at eight hundred three three one nine for nine six eight hundred three three one line for nine six\nSo we're ... we're just talking off air about different you know stuff that's going on in the marketplace it's funny you know the roofing is goes up and down with with numbers and certainly this has been a year that pricing has been up because the suppliers take advantage yes when they when they have an opportunity of\nBeing busy funny how all it's like a monopoly the the ... the the distributors and the manufacturers all say hey we haven't gone up in in a year so let's let's go four times this year because it's really busy yeah and um you know that happens across the board and and\nWe're virtual reality yes yeah and that and I think that that's folks want to shop and the comfort of their own home just like the NFL wants to go to a game and freeze their bought off when you can sit on the couch and it's a better experience you watch every game relax I've I've never been an NFL\nIn live you know granted in September October maybe when it's somewhat warm but you couldn't pay me to go to maybe it's a playoff game or something but generally I don't want to go there to lose your whole day you're ... you're you're stuck in the parking lot for two hours on the way out\nTwo hours away in two hours one way or that or I was watching the game no thank you I I agree yeah\nI I ... ... people are too busy that's why baseball is so it is so boring to everyone no one wants to sit there and watch these eighty five pitching changes and a four and a half hour game forget about the Eighteen endings just a regular game is four and a half hours\nOne has that's why I don't know kids are playing baseball you because the parents are checking their cell phone and their text messages I let's go let's get outta here we don't we don't want to go\nTo our window you know if you're playing soccer lacrosse and football is those are the basketball there's a clock the clock running and that will not clock ends the game\nAnd it's constant action yeah you can watch Johnny play the whole game even involved\nBaseball your kid comes up to bat once an hour and yet right you know once every forty five minutes and even the field and they could ball gets hit to him once or twice a game and that's and that startled some that the boss coming [laughter] where to take our halfway break your ... you know we'll try to get back on track as we talk\nA home remodeling eight hundred three\nMonths in practice and escape playing for you and your muscle and learn more of us ... down in the dark as it gets signed in every one site\nI can only run one appointment night and even if that and then if my kids got to a game I Can't go and run leads that night next thing you know so they're letting all of these opportunities just blow by blow by blow by and it drives them crazy so sometimes they just say you know what\nForget it I'm going to go work for somebody and you know pay me good money I don't want to\nThey're running ragged because because during the books doing the sales running the jobs something's gotta give by how can you focus at work all day when you're worried about everything else\nAll you got your focus got four o'clock appointment and you're right in the middle of doing things and it's now three o'clock in the wrap up in calls a day\nYou blow on another day behind ... where if you work until three thirty four o'clock and get that project finished or you will head of the game so you you have to make a commitment on whether you want to be a sales a salesman ... a worker a labor\nOr or whichever type of field you want to go into that you can't do all three of them was tool the two of them are going to suffer\nNo doubt no doubt and I think that everyone struggle even internally John we struggle and we have\nFolks like yourself that get overworked and you'll have have you know we rely on you so much because you have so much skill you know Jeff we've got guys that can do multiple things and handle multiple tasks and and you lean on people when it's super busy you know luckily eventually a kind of blows over but\nIt it's it's tough when you're in that in\nThat you got to ride the wave Adam yeah you know\nYour answer famine and there's been no matter what you do is not always a way it's either it's a six month off on six months off business it really is you know you you you you really kind of come to a screeching halt but right now it's it's\nEveryone says oh this spring is the busiest way than the late fall is by far the busiest time of of of\nThe year I looked on my calendar January February and ah I see why I'm work out so much in September October and November right\nWhile you're doing the work and you're lucky we're lucky that we're able to stock up the work flow because of all the other projects that are are settled and put together now that our our businesses leaned a little bit more long term as we're doing more\nLarger projects or you know they take awhile to plan they take a while to get through zoning and and be approved so next thing you know if you close a deal and in mid November may not be starting till mid January and finishing in the spring\nRight which is a good thing for people out there that have plans are looking for a plan designed to look at a break ground and uh it's a tool it's a two month process to get all these all this paper I call a paper trail to get this paper chill and order so you can start breaking so you can get into the labor in the construction end of it\nYeah I think um you know I've talked about this endlessly but I Do want to make recommendations I think nationally what\nThey're finding is working to help the skilled labor shortages is for companies like ours to ... to to make an initiative and to take on more apprentice programs way to really bring folks him because you've got to train people if you want to write because what's out there isn't enough and then there's what you want\nWell it costs it costs the corporation costs the company money to train course a installers\nBut in the long run as long as they stay with you as long as they make a commitment to work with you after you after you factory trained them you know that it's a good ... then it's a good investment yeah I mean what happens is uh we factory train or a couple and laws for three weeks four weeks and months six weeks\nOr after they get factory trained and after they get the certification\nThey ... they work a couple of weeks and then they say well we got all our certification we need thank you very\nWell yeah but you know there's you you know there's there's ways to combat that I mean you have to offer more I mean it's different you know it's it's offered the offer the over time time and a half its its offer four one K. it's off the benefits because you know it used to be the case in this industry you're still carpenter\nYou're not getting benefits like you're not you're not getting a a you know overtime you're not getting you know even the W. too\nSo this has changed dramatically over the past\nDecade because because the market has flipped there's ... you know it's supply and demand John yeah it's pretty simple there's there's too many jobs to be done out there and not enough workers\nOr ... before every everybody with a truck had a lot of latter brackets out of there were there were ... they were ... they were window installer now you can't even find them now yeah you know every every firefighter was or how does how trades whether it was a plumber electrician or a\nA sheet rock or or window installer mhm or even a landscaper yes uh they they're they're in their in their fields right now where they don't need to work this extra time these extra jobs to make ends meet\n[noise] yeah it's different different world I mean and and I think ah I expected to continue um especially in the in the in the greater Boston market for ever [laughter] basically and and I and I think that it will be you know in in central mass western mass northern Connecticut it'll be it'll it'll continue to busy busy busy as valuable you're not residential\nIt's commercial to Adam everything yeah commercial industry out in the Boston Boston area you know I was in a Dorchester the other day and uh the commercial buildings you you don't think they could squeeze in another building it in a\nProper yeah sure they can they gotta not Scott I'm not going down right I've got three of them go inside I say it's called dynamite right it's incredible well I mean ... ...\n... ... what are they going\nAs well as you are it's called well are you thinking of it in two different ways but what do you say ... what do you what are you saying what do you mean were they\nWere they parking ... where the park and all these people on these big high rises to build them right in the middle section you know was of all the all the traffic you know the ... in infrastructure can't can't the\nCan handle it well I'm thinking of it to ... more from like a standpoint of gentrification like where where are the folks go because it's become so expensive and you know there where's that where's the Affordable housing because I don't see it\nI mean it's it's like disappeared in these areas like Framingham is a perfect example used to be\nHeavy immigrant um area ten years ago and all these big you know triple decker and an end to families now those triple decker is our individual single conduct is\nSelling for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars each you got a million to property than they used to be three hundred thousand dollar tripled doctors and they were very affordable housing well that's all changed gentrification is a nice way of saying get out yeah because it's too expensive for you to live here and we want to charge more money\nAnd where people going\nSo I don't have the answer that question because I don't see I Know that there's there's still", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sturdy Home Improvement", "city": "Worcester", "day":
