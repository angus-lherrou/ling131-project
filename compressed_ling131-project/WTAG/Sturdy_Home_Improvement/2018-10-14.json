{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Or\nAre they elected to continue to experience declined with something that the interest rate continues to go up a wondering what your thoughts are on the to on this topic\nCarrie thanks for your question um yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create\nFurther declines in the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this number one yes the markets do anticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing dissipate that and they adjust securities prices based on that\nIn other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market is a leading indicator not a lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked in\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond\nWill have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense the longer the duration the longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing and value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should probably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you hold on a mature you don't have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to\nWhatever market prices are being offered at that time then you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bonds in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year majorities rather than twenty and thirty year majorities of for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this is something new and different for investors most folks are comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to interest rate risk\nFor the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates are pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment and not realizing that race could go up not just down and they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because\nFor the past since Nineteen eighty them bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up or down a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question because a lot of folks at the very same question\nDon't buy a bond unless you plan to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably on bonds in that funds that are shorter in maturity rather than longer and to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them you should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plan Rick to tackle that question for you here's another question and we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nIronic that just make them more prone to answer a question about tariffs we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied to all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase of crisis for a number of the products that we can see where it's purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariff money go does it go straight to the government coffers\nDoes is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers um\nIt's really that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and and there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem but the burden is paid by American\nConsumers who a foot the bill so yeah that's what terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of ever noticed that you know longer right your taxes at the end of the year to the IRS they want you to write your check to the United states treasury because nobody wants to write a check or the IRS but everybody has happened to be patriotic and write a check to the United states treasury [noise]\nWe don't have a welfare

[noise]\n[noise]\nTotally consumed by a chilling last for power I'm Pam ... Fox News President Trump rattling that charge against Democrats in a political rally in Kentucky\nI was a showing my companion that I drive in today his name is Hank number [laughter] hey can I we're talking all the way here and you know ... on them just shock and awe but we were talking you know get a word in\nYeah I wouldn't let him thought I got it when he does like up he agrees with everything I say what's the best thing about it so [laughter] no but seriously um you you do see that the actually the best time of year to understand\nYour ventilation and insulation problems of your home\nNow a lot of people are going to go home what do you what are you talking about but but Yeah John you see those lines on the roof those are your rafters right yes rafters are not insulated would is not an insulator so the heat is escaping out of your addict through the wood right that's\nThe reason why you have the insulation in between in in Cape style homes or if it's cold enough inside of it that's where the ... you know what I mean so that's where you see these things and uh we're looking at a Cape style house and you could see those lines everywhere which is kind of funny but yeah\nIt's it's it's amazing how um the frost will also tell you the warm spots because now of course is the the top of the roof is there's no frost but everything's down at the bottom for the rich friends not working you\nYou rejects that work in the heat the heat or building up build it up into the rich and ... and there's this moisture there's moisture in the first five feet of the of the ... coming down off the origin of ... that means you got to the heat loss that's right a wood heat Lawson with ventilation comes an insulation factor\nSo yeah and I think I I feel\nThat the Cape style houses I one of the worst type of homes they can properly instantly\nIt isn't it well it's not the ... well it's an ... not ... it's a it's almost impossible but the problem is John\nUsing old technology it's one of the worst yeah but there's new technology right that you can do it better\nThan how we used to do it because of raptors we're maybe at the most the to buy it you know and that was the problem is that they would go all the way up and they were really they weren't making to buy for teens so you don't have a lot of sickness of insulation that you could pack and there were fiberglass right\nBut now they make spray from right and so here's the problem John\nMost people don't want to know how to do right because of the expense of the expense but you still have to explain it to him right hey no problem I'm more than happy to fix your roof properly and here's how we're going to do it rip your roof off rip the boards off pull out all the insulation\nWe're going to then spray foam your entire addict top to bottom put all the plywood back onto the roof back on this possible we\nCan do that yes I I've I've done jobs I've we've that magnitude yes ah\nThe those discriminating clients that say get it done get it done right I don't care what the expense do it\nWell those are the people that have also have dealt with mold that have dealt with you know vermin in their house you know I don't know about you but the nose spray foam especially close el ... spider not an aunt that mouse nothing is going to go through the\nLawyer low moisture is going to infiltrate nothing and uh the the old kc style houses you know before they have proper that's a raft of raptor mates they put the insulation right to the deck and\nAnd that that created the more than a moss issue from the inside out because you couldn't see the condensation that was building up between the debt for\nUh the roof the roof she's in board and the insulation right uh once you take that off you're you're you're better off just removing the the sheep on the show like the plank board and putting insulation in and doing the job in the proper me in one\nOf the Facebook friends of ours is making common uses any proper venting in the sausage and an escape through the rich or the ... the floor of the addict should be properly insulated and well blown in or on faced insulation\nThe um the paper phase should of course vape toward the vapor barrier moisture of the inflation making it\nA useless overtime yes that's true of the old techno yes ed I'm Sorry my cousin I Love 'em and I just wanted to say shot\nAnother guy off off the face but I Know they're going to\nAnother guy that was just until the blonde me and say I don't like you but it is the old technology has sorry\nUm I Will no longer use fiberglass insulation on any project that I Do greater than you know like if it's a kitchen and it's one wall will do that by but if we're doing in addition we're redoing an addict\nWe're redoing the house adding on we're only doing spray foam okay\nAnd the reason for that is fiberglass insulation believe it or not as the filter you sit heat will escape through it yes and if you look at the our value okay you're never going to get to a point of a hundred percent are about right you're never going to stop the complete loss with fiber to us\nWell 'cause there's always area filtration coming through whether it's a because in in between the rafters got dressed tucked one way or the other around the electrical outlets what about\nThe way we do the air sealing which is what you're supposed to do first before putting more insulation it's\nYou're at it the stretch energy coach today you need what you are going to talk about right\nBut you're supposed to um put a spray foam around every single hole that goes up into your right now if you were to 'em and eliminate all that forget about all that forget about the rich meant not working forget about the socket events not working\nBecause you can put more insulation you can get this office work completely perfect you can get the rich meant work not all rich friends work the same okay so when are you\n... as I was I was going to stop I stopped\nGoing to take a break we're going to take a primary job I was I was gonna let you refer yeah but now it's gonna he's disagreeing with me so we'll come\nBack we'll come back here to give us a

I don't think they've caught up with the times I think it's just like the the ... building code that have been caught up with the times uh they're doing much better but I'm I'm really disappointed with Massey for not including spray foam into their costs because it would cut down even more energy\nBut um I don't know why but it's a very good question to ask those guys um why won't they pay for some of the newer technology that's available\nBecause of the costs of it you know Johnny when ... when you get into an app into an addict or across base when they have the the duck worked up ... up in a in the know John\n... wait a minute why is ... ... why do they even exist and I'm not going to speak for them so please we're not trying to\n... but I understand why the utility companies all joined in to say hey let's help people out save energy because in order for them to build another nuclear power plant that to be ... next to impossible so we can reduce the amount of demand that on their service because if they're running a Ninety percent\nA demand on a nuclear power plant they got to reduce the amount of demand right and the only way they can do that without having to build another one to to meet the demand is to say hey guys save energy full well that makes a lot of sense to me\nMarriage have not save is run by the national grid ever saw yeah they're all pull their money together and say hey guys\n\nHeat in it if you look on your utility bill is a number to call there's an eight hundred number to call in just call the number and uh everybody qualify for this and it's not a not for the richest not for the poor\nYou know but not every town qualify like I was the only negative side because if you have a local municipality that has their own light or their own power you know you know mostly like because there's nobody generating their own power that I think of right now not I don't know I don't think so\nBut I imagine you know a new thing of today would be absolutely to go to um you know all solar and everything else so let's go to a break\nWe're going to break a ... will be back eight hundred three three one nine for nine six just as ...\nAs a home or if you want a company that pays attention to detail sturdy home with your job is a company\nBy on site job supervising thirty finds itself on completing your roofing job in two days or less for you can get a thousand dollar refund why because it's dirty home is a beautiful called starting home if Ruben today at eight seven seven three thirty that's eight seven seven three thirty below gone too dirty home dot\nCom\nHas a homeowner you want a company with an attention for detail at sturdy home improvement your roofing job as a company by an outside job supervisor sturdy prides itself on completing a roofing job in two days or less for you get a two thousand dollar ... why\nBecause I was starting home is a beautiful costs thirty home improvement today for log on to thirty home dot com [noise]\nHi this is Adam Lucy from study home\nIf you need to replace her old drafting windows I flew in from Asia that will help to insure you find the that's the best value every window manufacturer is required to report their ratings for the national federation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sturdy Home Improvement", "city": "Worcester", "day": "14"}
