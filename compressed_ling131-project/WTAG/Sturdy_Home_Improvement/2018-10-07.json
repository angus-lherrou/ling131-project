follow the rules very carefully you could not only in Coeur taxes but you also encourage penalties up as much as fifty percent\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw\nAnd it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said your doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life if you wanted to do it\nOn a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you'll get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the count at the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ... with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name and other Iranian her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but we separately care if any of those accounts\nWere for one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the town on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nThe rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are on yielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court\nYour blood most likely going to lose that case\nSo we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or errors or omissions\nAnd a reputable advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur\nSo we'll be careful make sure you get it right don't mess around when it comes to withdrawals out of your account\nSo that sounds good Rick and and we do only have two accounts and uh I Do coordinate with my account so good we make sure they know the amount is right I always take out an extra two dollars [laughter]\nVery clever so chat I'm Glad you got it on the money I'm Glad you're on the ball there I Wish everybody else was to ... thanks very much for your call\nWell You're welcome have a great day\nYou to a that was Jeff from uh Charlotte Hi Marilyn if you have concerns or questions or confusion about your retirement accounts and the required

withdraw the money in the year that they've turned Seventy but they haven't yet reached age Seventy and a half guess what\nRift draw doesn't count so when I talk about the complexity of the rules quite frankly it's a whole thing's a a set up at the rules are so complicated they're designed to trick you and trap you\nEnabling the IRS to nail you with penalties these rules could be made so much simpler so much easier so much more fair\nThat would eliminate the need for the complexity which does no useful purpose for anyone other than to frankly provide job security for accountants\nI'm Rick

my health\nAll right well look John I think people in general I Wonder if we created this ourselves we as contractors the seasons you know like we think that fall\nIs we you know the ... the myth by the way the missing the roofing industry is that fall is the best time to put a roof on your house I would you agree or you don't agree\nI I I disagree with you a ha I don't know I now I Love it\nCertainly with the Everytime you speak\nAnd bring it on baby let go that'd be I think\nThe springtime the best time to put her will follow the summertime when president a fall then you've already with me no no in in the face I agree with you you you you said the far was the best I Know that's what contractors tell him all that is what consumers believe okay\nI think the spring and the summer's the best time to put a roof on this way here it can a shield down into the uh the ... sealed license with the hot sun yes our tap seal\nAnd now you get the win warranty from a hundred and ten to a hundred and thirty mile per hour yes I've played a real fun in the fall\nOr in November and in the sun's not hitting the roof as often as they should stick to melt those tar tabs instill that roof together they have a chance for in a severe when you have with a tablet lift up and now the compromises the tar tab\nI I'm telling you are right now John I absolutely agree with you a hundred percent because I think the biggest myth in our industry\nIs that roofing should be done in the fall well that's because you're going to go out go out and here's why because it's the worst time to do your roof in in in you know let me rephrase that I Apologize\nIt is one of 'em not the worst time it's still a good time you can look at it does but prices are going to be a little higher because guess what all the contractors are busy yes so when is the best time to do it when it's slow\nRight because when it's low prices are slow and then think about this John\nThroughout the entire summer how many times that we get notified that the price of ... the price of roofing materials going up yes it's been three price increases since uh January every single time but now after December what happens price drops right because what happens the the supply and demand takes place\nNobody's doing a roof in Christmas right\nOkay now if the weather's mild and you can get it done great\nBut if magic have you placed an order on January first\nThink about this for a second you go when you get a contractor and say soon as the weather breaks soon as the weather's good I Want you to do the truth now that might be march or April you're locked in the prices right you've got the job you can have the material sitting in the driveway\nThey're not going to go back in the snow but the materials and the well I Know what we're not gonna but I'm just saying if they did and they got their inside of a plastic wrap or they're not going to get them it's right while the snowplows going to ... different [laughter] well we can put it in the basement and put it in the garage Saturday you know to move it four times before we put them yeah exactly but my\nPoint to you is that if if we locked in those prices with a contractor unless they had an escalation clause in their contract that if you know price of shingles doubled\nWell then guess what you could actually get a very reasonably priced roofer last year's pricing right\nAnd so you then make a decision on your own time but not based on you know I mean I don't know about I think everybody can a one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six is the number to call one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six if you want to join the conversation\nI think that if you call the contractor today I think you'll find that they're very busy\nThey they're not coming out to give you estimates wire 'cause they're busy working and what happens when they do show up because they're busy all the price increases hey I've got enough work to keep you busy for three months if I double the number and I don't get the job\nI'm OK I'm shame on shame on the cusp the consumer out there\nThat choose the contractor that's been out there and he's four months backlogs and now comes the science of contract\nNow comes to cold frigid weather and he's put a roof find your house right shame on the homeowner I tell people I tell people roofing still you still have a strong October November and a half of December before the snow ... calls a flies in and then you you have to stop putting roofing ah but\nIsn't it true John that roofing right now throughout all of the contractors down yes isn't it true that you do not see a lot of people replacing the roots right now\nWell there's still plenty of work out\nTo you know there's work but I'm saying if you don't see the ... John you remember the days when you and I were selling you know three and four routes that day yes okay you're lucky if you get three and a roof so weak\nDon't forget now that was that was Fifteen Years ago I Know when we're over in ... when ... when ... when we were taking the tree tap shingle off a roof ... only lasted ten Fifteen ... because it wasn't ventilated properly and it was today today if you put a roof firehouse Twenty years ago\nIs still looks like they want to look out of ventilation right if you're headed correctly and that's why that's why the resources have slowed down right and because of all those catastrophes that we had in the areas where people you know we had a tornado in two thousand eleventh two thousand twelve we had ... and yet I was twelve\nIn abundance of rules were done whether the rules for five years old or ten years old or Fifteen Years old they all need a new roof at that time between heal damage and things like that so that's why the ... the roof in marketplaces slowed down because now all these groups are just eight to ten years old\nAnd there's no need to put a new roof of the house that was roof is only eight ten years old\nRight and that's and that's what I'm Talking about John is that I think that if you look at the the marketplace itself I think there's a lot of people out there that are not really putting on roost right now because of the fact that it is um [noise]\nI I don't think that there's a lot of people that are thinking of doing their roofs\nWell its roots are in need it right out of wine because I don't think\nWe had the hailstorm right I don't think we have wind damage I don't think we had you know the ice dams from last year I don't think there was a lot of ice and snow and stuff and we have\nPlenty of rain hold that thought Sam this is trust house calls going to take our first break give us a call after the break at eight hundred three three one nine foot\nBrian he now where the song heroes his imagine this week in Nineteen eighty three total eclipse of the heart written by Jim Simon his number one in the U.S making ... Tyler the first well singer topped the charts\nAnd this week in Nineteen Ninety five one story morning glories relief and make more why stars of the British rock band only make champagne supernova exclusively release as a single us reaches number one on the modern wrong\nTo say\nTo find these radio by four point nine FM double duty aging\nAnd we're back to trust house call I'm ... and I'm Samaras REO or we're having a little technical ... I'm just messing around in\nThe studio okay so anyway I don't mind me how is everybody doing\nWe were talking it was it was a call this morning at eight hundred three three one nine for nine six and let's see if you can stop myself in San ... at a question about roofing site in windows kitchens bathrooms yeah Danny ...\nAnything you got any question do you have that you want to ask about how to improve your home I'm\nActually you know John it was funny we were last\nLast uh last Sunday excuse me\nWe did a someone called and about hardwood flooring yes\nAnd we were talking about that we I actually did that job you know this Thursday and friday and when my hardwood flooring guy was there we actually had the same discussion and it was funny to hear him described the same exact thing that we talked about was when you start that for off\nIt's going to become blotchy in my plane you know and what are you going to cover the deck with a you know ... I mean all you do that you can tenth as well and that would be crazy you know she can tend to put a while it all depends on how big the deck is a ten by ten ... know what\nI'm saying this guy's that's asking the question most likely has a much larger deck okay so well and if it's you know twenty by twelve you know then that's a big tent\nYou know the now now do you think to yourself or is it time where if I painted and preserve it is it going to last another five years there was only the last one year out and do you do you go to a composite that\nWell they are but then you know that's expensive yes you know so now John the other thing too and it's a great question to ask because I think it also leads into ducking like we're talking about earlier\nIf you buy a brand new pressure treated deck\nYou cannot and let me rephrase this one more time you can not stain it are painted for the first six months to eight months to a year\nIt has to dry out I bought a pressure treated piece of wood John that weighed ten times more than what it did just because it had so much moisture in the eyes of that pressure treated\nAnd it it it weighed more than that the older ones that were sitting on the shelf because there was pressure was brand new\nSam we're gonna have to take a pause Breyer this is trust house called gives us a call at eight hundred three three one night\nI why a bank and you know anything about her life is none of their time today literally\nGoing through every fine tooth comb of your life to find out whether you're going to pay them back\nWell they're protecting themselves course they are you know the phrase the banks were ruthless this way and I don't like banks and I don't like insurance companies because they only protect themselves well they don't protect you as a consumer\nWhile they're in business to make money in the in the audience companies in business to save money in the U.S as a whole ... you need the the protection fund the what the banks and with the insurance companies also seemed to help you in the in the near future if you if during need\nRight and you do if we can focus in on you the consumer first and say hey guys\nGo get your loan figure out how much money you got the bank sell off your stocks and bonds you know figure out where you know if you're getting a gift from a family member find out how much it is right figure out how much you got then talked to a contractor because if you have no money\nYou shouldn't be getting estimates on something that you have no money to do\nWell you're right I Would check credit scores and and see if your credit is up to par if you go to\n... dot com right here you can go on your phone or your smartphone and in anything like this is what you're going to find it\nIt's very simple yes and uh this way he can find out what your credit scores and if you in your half decent credit and you have no money you can also find me a ... an secure loans\nTo green sky synchrony this this probably five or six to ... a different institutions that offer financing right at the un secured say give me a credit card and some of them go up to thirty five forty thousand ... and\nJohn that's where you come in right because now that if you know that you can't get money from a bank or that your credit score is doing really good and you know you have no loans then it shouldn't be a problem with writing zero percent financing or a ... very low interest financing\nFly nine nine the seven point nine nine to nine point nine nine depending on what\nYou want and and you find the answer for Eighteen months no ... no payment you guys offer finding yes see finance finance and it's very important to the people that that need the job done and because if if you're if you have equity in the home is still going to take your six to eight weeks to get that money right\nSo just to the audience understands you know thirty home improvement offers financing for those people that need to get a roof right and it's available to you or you don't have to do what no money down a little money\nDown okay it's just just based on your credit score\nSee for me as a small contractor I don't do that I don't have that so my job is more of the you know kitchens bathrooms handyman stuff that type of thing I Love the small jobs those are the things that I enjoy the most\nUm the ones where you guys come into your offer additions and kitchens and remodeling and the same thing in your off this financing available here those projects\nSo for me I don't do that John and that's okay because that's the cost of doing business and I also the paperwork and have a you know a staff like you guys out but that's okay there's nothing wrong with that\nYou're a good local contractor that does work John you guys Connecticut\nEaster mastering that as a matter of whether you're all over Massachusetts there'll be a natural gas west or we can\nHandle the volume in or just like if you need a roof we can handle the volume of putting a refined your home right we do over two hundred three hundred ... a year and a world company that can withstand any type of ah any type of job no jobs too small little jobs too big for us to handle it and then we get out there and do it in a professional manner\nAnd and you know it's funny because we've always all used to talk on the show about consumer protection and one of the things you know as I'm passionate\nAbout is understanding the differences between one contractor and another\nThe other biggest missed in our industry that I Want everyone I don't care if you're listening in Massachusetts Connecticut Washington D. C. where every year at one of the things that you need to understand is that this myth that you cannot share an estimate with another contractor is a myth\nI cycle Dolly it's like going down the casino in ... and you're calling somebody's bluff to the see what what type of contract from another contract\nAnd if they end by the way it does the number matter no no the estimate on that the number that that's on that contract doesn't matter until you compare apples to apples who you get that comparison of the job\nAnd they don't know I Do I ask them covers a name up if you're embarrassed above than they cover the name of his way to be embarrassed\nAbout John John we we technically compete against the yes yeah OK\nAnd when I'm In the room with someone else and they said well John a soloist here I go hey just a good friend of mine right great company nice guy absolutely people you can trust right right okay so why would I sit there and speak ill of a good company now if there is a bad\nCompany what is your mother always say if you got nothing good to say don't they don't say don't you think it's a consumer you want people to tell you going on ...\nWell I I just I I look at the line item Sam I says I don't need a name I'll need the bottom line to show you can look at the school show me showed me the middle of the guts of the of the proposal\nWhere the scope of workers listed already taken a permanent now they have proper insurance are they putting their own dumpster out of the driveway or the or are certified by the manufacturer or to use it will use a roofing sample are they using six feet of ice and water\nAre they using the synthetic on the layman are using trip pages a three inch five inch or eight inch strip edge are they using started to ... to cut the tree tap shingle\nAre using the hip and rich cap or they cut the tree tap shingle for the hip and rich kept these are people just fell asleep listening to that leaving [laughter] they might have fell asleep but they're all looking at their contracts and looking at you know looking at him right now and say\nCheese that part of the ... is that part of the scope of work right and that and that determines the war coverage also say that that that goes from a a ten twenty year two fifty lifetime\nYou're let's talk about this John if you had a roofing estimate and the guy says well I'm using you know I think well you know what I've been sued before so it's OK I'll say it anyway let's say they're using attempt go single ever seen that you know such junk that garbage that they put on houses that", "show_name": "Sturdy Home Improvement", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "07"}
