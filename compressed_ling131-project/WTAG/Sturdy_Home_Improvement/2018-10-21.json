{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "The goodness can remember whether it would have stripped stands for separate trading of registered interest in principle of securities strips mean Wall Street loves to invent products that's why they're called the residence their products based on other products so you've got to U.S Treasury that's a government bonds issued by the U.S government\nAnd you know how government bonds work you give the federal government money and they give you interest and then they give you your principal upon maturity and Wall Street takes these government bonds that are very safe and conservative and\nTurn them into other investments and they strip out\nThe interest in principle from the securities because some of the investors want the interest in other investors want the principal a different time periods so they\nTake these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor against the principal back at maturity and encircle strips in so Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grand tour receipts there are page after the income generators but no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's Wall Street doesn't like bears um we like balls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security called a bull\nUm but anyway I digress so\nLet me ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a tip a treasury inflation protected security oh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CD now which are destroying regular interest and what I wanted to do is\nTake out enough money where I don't go over the limit to add up to my Medicare payments\nEvery year mhm with increases\nAnd I know it could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my Ira between me and the wife\nAnd I don't want to have any additional ... oh I did I had that you know be paying to stay in other words what I read the areas that they do is take you don't have to report that to the state\nArt hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYeah so have you done an analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that it\nProbably going to be enough whether or not you know depending on how long that naturally and how long the wife live\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just do a real quick back of the neck in effort what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of ...\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk and therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond a relative to a Banksy day I don't know if the difference is all that\nWorthwhile relative to the complexity the securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary bank CDs the difference in the fields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this is based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper or I could certainly argue that\nAll of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got and the amount of income you need if not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nAh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues waving office in Cherry Hill not far from you in Mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing financially speaking I think you and your wife would be fine\nOkay okay over there in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is then if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number and we'll connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and ah go from there okay that'd be fine\nAll right Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do it Neal dead and call triple each plant record it's really important that you put your investment strategy and the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication to your life\nGetting into securities you're not really familiar with are accustomed to when the material differences in results are really not going to be there when in\nFact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that's the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think you'd care very much\nWarren Buffett I don't think he really needs his Social Security check right so for them it's not a big deal for you and me so how do you know if you're going to have enough\nI Want you to find out by getting your free retirement review we will provide this to you for free\nWill look at your retirement savings and

show\nTripoli plan on line at rice filming dot com [noise]\nProviding personal financial advice for over twenty five years this is the ...\nAsian [noise]\nThe kids would see that what you're doing yeah that'd be reversed question\nSo one of the things that we're gonna talk about today John that I Want to get into it with you is a little bit about home security and things that we can do that maybe not require\nA ... you know a fancy very expensive items but I was a saw something that come across my screen and\nAnd I thought it was a good topic to maybe talk about just like locks okay your doors what can you do to fortified your house just in case if you have certain things that go on and and what are the better doors to get what are the ... you know better locks to get things like that [noise]\nUm so again this is the home improvement show we can change the topic anytime\nYou can email us you can Texas if you know either John or myself you can call us but this is a call in live radio show don't give your name you don't have to rely on you can make up a name yeah no one knows your voice my voice is pretty well known I guess you know in my head or [laughter]\nYou don't mind my own mind yeah you know and again you know if you have a question you could ask it off the air you can oh someone's here to take your\nCalls in here to help in the south this morning he or she was ready by the phones\nLands ready by the phone so again you're don't feel intimidated by the process and this is a live show this is not pre recorded okay this is not something that we you know come here\nTo help you we weren't here Tuesday Morning doing this you know when we're live on a Sunday Morning live on a Sunday Morning before we go to church after the shot [laughter]\nSo if you're out there and you're driving and you have a question about home improvement and maybe you know you want a second opinion that's why we call the doctors of home improvement you know this is where we come in and\nHelp you out so if you haven't seen have you ever heard to show\nThe show only works when you call so one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six again one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six you're going to listen to us to banter for a very good forty two minutes of a programming error but you know joined us if you have any questions so John\n... doors are a number of this ... this time of year where you know you put new windows in your house and now the doors you know you have that the stuffed animal that stuff's than snake on the bottom of your door keeping the draft\nOut [laughter] [laughter] this is neat yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they put the snake underneath the door they a draft and all that is the problem\nNow's the time to think about putting a new entry door into your home yes and along with a new entry door is\nA good deadbolt lock set yes now as a company we don't supplied to lock sets or the ... deadbolt\nBecause we can go out there and spend Nineteen dollars for that both of them I said you could spend over three hundred four hundred dollars for a good black set in missile range all it's very important that as a homeowner and you want to be secured\nYou want to be able to pick up the what you want as a lax at yes and he all nor I like to see on the on the on the door GM\nIs the metal casing around the block so yes the metal the little metal a trim around the locks at so if someone does try to kick the door and if you're preventing it from a good ...\nWell when you have um is it very simply John if you have a concerned over your door security right now you know you know the strike play where the ... comes through that's what I'm Talking right that little tiny plate\nOkay here's a very simple tip for you guys out there there's usually about an inch screw that just holds that into\nThe gym of the door yes okay take that screw out and replace that screw with a three or four inch screw right\nOkay that would prevent someone from coming by maybe kicking the door and breaking the gym right so just by simply changing those two screws you can make your house maybe ... feet you for your own peace of mind feel a little more secure\nWhile the the the more expensive the locks that the more expensive the better the the tools in the battle battle she knows that you will have\nSo I'm not a I'm you know I'm a ... of course locks that bolt into locks is always a good thing but the most important thing John in my humble opinion and I think you'll agree with me 'cause we didn't have this discussion\nIs a composite Jim yes a composite gym because when you buy a door out of the big box it comes with finger joined it would\nSo that's not what you want okay you don't want finger joins did would you want to have um\nA composite jam that's cost them we're not custom made but it's made for that door yes so that makes it a hundred and forty percent stronger for that gym so that it won't break or split that's what I ... that's what I said I resistance also in Sam and\nBesides that yes what are we always find that the composites ill or the syllabus adores the one thing that always rot south or as the water comes down to the door on the outside right at the bottom where there still is it always routes out well guess what with composite it'll never happen again so the only doors I sell is always with a composite\nGym well thermal who has a great in in ... to your door with a composite you didn't get the composite jam with the threshold you didn't get The Vagina you can't get it at a big bucks and really you can get anything special ordered\nWell but again through in ... you know through a professional distributor right someone that is a good company that we use as yes contractors\nWe don't buy stock doors and only time we buy stock doors is when you need a stock door like you know when you when you're just looking for you know a garage me indoor yeah you know and you're by the way you're selling the house in six months and you're out of there and you just want something cheap and in inexpensive and quick\nThat's what you would do but if you're looking for quality\nIt's your front door of your house we're going to order that door to size [laughter] this this door is not sitting somewhere waiting for you to buy\nYes you know it's you know usually is to buy six construction if it if it's a newer home in a house built by after Nineteen Ninety Ninety five or it's too by six construction right on the snap your fingers we haven't even started the show yeah and we're taking that first\nAnd that's the ... and she's good like that yes ma'am and we will be right back you my ... my name's Sam ... on\nInformation station every facet of life is to use radio fighting\nKind of am doubling UTA gee [noise]\nAnd we're back to the U.S house calm down in the summer and I'm ... don't forget\nTo give us a call this morning at eight hundred three three one night for nine six week answering the question we had the one lady Texas what's a gym on entry door\nThat's right and you know what John we speak in contract talk yeah you don't necessarily speak in comments and or common language that most people don't know about um some people you know what's a gym now we know what it is I mean we we sit here and looking at her go what do you really don't know what a gym is\nWhile it's true it's it's nice that [noise] a gym is the frame of the door\nAnd which the door locks into correct so and so it's a it's a frame around the door to a gym whether it's to buy for construction or to buy six construction is it uh would would a gym or a composite GM is [noise] insulated is it a right is it whether tight\nYou know this leads into I'm going to go off on a tangent real quick if you don't mind but I'll make sure we ... what else is [laughter] but I'm In the morning you know I'm Free warning you and then we could just come back to this but it it's terminologies [noise] excuse me got sun and so it's terminology is you know what is the\nUm you know valley what's the valley what's what's a gym or what the hip you know ... ... you know my hip of my body or the hip and the root of all you know All right so these are the terminologies that people don't necessarily understand in\nAnd they use the twelve you know what I mean when you only need it ate Connecticut I'm wrong they [laughter] they view that me for something else that has taken three feet or two of them yeah they ... they took one of the two and a six foot away [laughter] five foot when\nBy the way the gentleman John speaking the truth this has happened we've had people with not that much brain power working at times and you wonder but think about it is there a college for they become a carpenter\nWhile you can go to that you can go to a union you ... you know your your union that'd be a ... what's the word I'm looking for a a a print is an apprentice\nRight what have you learned on the job right that's the whole point right and I think that we should be encouraging more people to not go to college let's make sure we understand this um\nI notice now that absolutely everybody this is not for everybody but for those individuals that want to work with their hands you'll make more money working with your hands than working with your brain or doing you know computer graphics or whatever else these are some of these young kids are trying to graduate with\nAnd they need a trade we need people in the tree yes you want a job you want to make fifty sixty Seventy thousand a year without having a any college debt than I encourage you to stop looking at computer gaming and get in the field and learn something right because there's this is what we need this\nPort Chester Branford hall there are there are schools that are can be a good lead you into a trade\nWe're looking at electricians right now electrician can make forty eight dollars an hour if you wanted to play and if you worked in the union you make it even more with the benefit package you and everything else guess what electricity might be afraid of it but you learn\nYou know and these people are making a lot of money without a college education without spending that kind of money so I Would highly recommend\nFor those people out there to stop telling your kids to go to college and get them into a trade because it ... and I\nAnd I first I see him as very sincere about this ...\nPassionate because you know how many guys are out there John that we're looking for\nTo be able to work in the field because there's not there's no carpenters being made anymore right we have to take the young kids of today which were doing and I'm doing in my company and were training them learning them and say put down the YouTube and stop watching ... and put on YouTube and\nSee how they can get the phones out of their hands yeah but you know what no phone\nIn your hand and start you know researching how to frame of wall\nSam we're gonna have to take a second break the trust house call I'm John the cellar with Sam ...\n... [noise] ... register online poker\nMarching bands like high end with ... million or more in line up today at much for ... or\nI'll give us a call this morning at eight hundred three three one nine for nine six\nPaul was a good caller talked about uh doing a do it yourself or build your own house your own house\nFull of hundred square feet as a you know as a base he could probably due to twenty four hundred at a garage [laughter] you know that's a lot of work John yeah it is it's I look I tell you right now it's not easy as you weren't there is what's really now is it worth the Fifteen Percent savings it's not it's not I mean John I mean it ... if you haven't\nDone it but I or on the phone twenty four seven\nNo but look what is the best thing that you and I have John that we can bring to the table compared to the average homeowner [noise]\nI have Fifteen jobs lined up for you Mr framer I have you know X number of jobs lined up for you Mr plumber if you want your money come finished this one so we have that ability to work with are subs now I have to say I'm very very fortunate in by the grace of God I have some very good subcontractors\nElectricians and plumbers and we all know who the last ... those are the key to very good yeah not just having them you know working together\nYes and you know what I'm I'm not perfect or they're not perfect but we work together yeah and we make things happen you know a give you a perfect example I'm a electricians says yeah I'll take care of that I'm going to clean up after myself and then he didn't\nDo I yell at him no I go take care of it why 'cause\nHe showed up when he wasn't even supposed to be my [laughter] you know so am I going to argue with you a famous or you're doing him moving why or why am I going to sit here and argue with him when I go I have to spend an hour of time to clean up after him like deal you know what in the scheme of things in our relationship that we have\nHe was busy he was alone he couldn't get it I got it somewhere in yeah I'll take care of you know is it his job yes but guess what\nThis is the thing we have better than you as the homeowner [noise] we have relationships with our vendors that we can you know uh I kitchens delayed by a week and of course we start you know\nYelling and screaming in that in our own loving way right John because we don't yell and scream we kinda go really you know and we get into that with our our our vendors and instead push them and then all of a sudden it shows up three days later\nI mean one thing about a kitchen is only one kitchen in the house where a bathroom you can get away with a one week delayed because there's usually two bathrooms in the house but\nThe on the kitchen and a week to lay that's an inconvenience for the whole family yes and in ... and those are the types of jobs we need to have everything on the schedule and if something is if there was a hit ... one thing on the schedule that backs everything up a couple of days where I Need you need to have a professional\nUh attitude when you're doing a somebody's kitchen\nRight and again uh the question goes back to can it is it worth the savings and the answer is no do you know hire professional get it done because here's the beautiful thing that I can pass on to him if you don't if you're not happy you're not writing a check like plain and simple you\nKnow it it one of the other topics that you know that I'm always passionate about John is consumer protection\nAnd end the best thing that I could ever tell and the advice that I give to even my customers\nWhen you're smiling writing a check everything is okay yes but when you're sitting there frustrated and you're mad and you're upset don't write the check yes don't because that piece of paper is what keeps us all honest\nAnd if you say you know for example I I got Hank in the studio here right you know if he was wandering the the room and being a bad boy right now does he get a treat no but if I say hey sit stay\nHe gets a tree right so we're just like them were ducks [laughter] you know we want to treat we what we'll do whatever you say and then you pass in and then we're done\nAnd when you're in the middle of a of a job and it's not the right look Trish and you can't fire that looked Trish in because he's he's he's pulled all permits and he's the he's the man to do the giant\nSo if you have any questions one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six any topic anytime any situation just let us know will change gears were okay with that\nYou know so give us a call so one eight hundred\nAnd we got George impacts them with a roofing question George how are you sir\nYes come on and good morning I own a mobile home down in Florida yes and ah last winter I had a contractor\nOr
