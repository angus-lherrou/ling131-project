{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh but just because he he surpassed\nThe average lifespan I don't think it was as low as forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ... I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff and you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I check it out\n[noise] uh east of the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my play the\nIdea that they didn't ... originally made their money to the science trade that for a day a wet I'm more a humane

the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with similar in South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter]\nReally interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from summer\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old old east coast family uh probably it's old

the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those needs to call them the Boston blaming those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what\nIf I was paid a

Tony Saturday near ... Georgia\nYeah uh so yeah we we now have a life where of the above a certain amount of uncertainty but also\nThe sphere of that's it's it's a you know I I went to a concert recently had you had to go through metal detectors don't want to go to a ball game you've got to go through a metal detector\nProtecting yourself from the as soon as you\nWell I guess you're protecting yourselves or the the theory must be a that somebody could walk into the concert or the ball game uh and uh start opening fire\nThen we're the same old same old we were afraid of that [noise] who\nWell now that you put it in those terms yes where everybody is afraid of the\n... but ...\nIs a qualitative difference I guess between the Nineteen fifties where people sucked into the schools that I think\nAgain ... which I think generally in those days last hope is something beyond his like his life was emblematic iconic of\nFor the lives of the world to see how that him and it's been placed by middle detectors and [noise]\n\nAnd you're right now I don't remember any one having a security system at their home\nBusinesses\nBut now you know it's the the thing to do you know and these are sold on television and in the papers you know you got to have a right cameras everywhere a\nJerk [laughter] it's why is this fear\nThe question is why the here and what isn't here about what are we ready to [noise]\nBut you mentioned earlier that the fear was a\nConsequence of serial killers or fear of uh people shooting others up in a\nMovie house orders stadium or\nYour church you know some judges station people who know what to look for the door because someone will come into a\nShooting the congregation we know that in places like Egypt\nMiddle East\nAre Christian Church members of other religions will come in and think nothing of stuff in ...\nWell that's true and also it's true is or what happens in America this we're not immune from people shooting up people in charge\nA lecture just suffered because someone not too long ago was one of the churches and kill people or the Sunday service yeah thinking or doing something\nSo you raise a very important question why is there the sphere and the ... census suggests that there is maybe reason to be fearful but why are these things happening when they didn't happen fifty or sixty years ago what and I think you made reference to the fact that the those days are people had hope\nAnd that hope I think came from being much more connected to God\nI don't want to get you sing in\n[laughter]\nI'm hesitant to mention it but it was a popular song charged here's the whole world and cancer remember this yeah\nAnd I don't know so I could think of the pop charts she has no world yeah as you are in need of it is said\nAnd I think what it says if there was more to life than we have in\nWay but that's that's a\nWell you mentioned songs and there were a number of songs in the fifties sixties that had reference to a chapel or had reference to a\nGod or\nThe hope if you will that we seem to have forgotten\nHoping and security devices and metal detectors\nAnd cameras and things like this Saturday and they're good for now hang on the ice and there's been several thoughts as anyone else is interesting\nYou said something that struck me as each other and Greek or a sheep on a case in person on the same logic like let's say you're looking your brother in the face and your sister\nCannot fully a person unanimous that to me and says looking to save the same kind\nSaying here's someone has it I Love God and my having seen one of my

that shows him taken to the nth degree [noise] hell is the other person is ... than in that\nHere we are wondering why is that his fear because the other person is no longer the gateway to having but now there are enemy you guys left an island in the least keep them on the other side of the locks security system [noise]\nWell I think you're absolutely right how to correct this misunderstanding if you will how do you provide safety in\nPeople's minds that God is still in charge of the universe and still watching over us and\nThe fact is that ah he's not happy with the are being antagonistic to each other or belittling each other I mean we're all supposed to be children of God\nAnd there you go to those who children in God and so instead of the other of being a harbinger of life\nAnd I kind of the king and suddenly become the potential for harming injury and death\nAnd and and we're living in a in a fortress fortress I think the social engineers you show us that if they removed die from the equation so somehow that would make things better but now that we see the other is\nAssistant you see them as intact stories enemy and it did as a consequence moving guy from the social equation [noise]\nI think it's one of the unfortunate developments that happened with taking got out of our lives uh you know a ...\nA prayer to schools you know longer have a sense of the blue laws that exist

Sundays and a half a they said something that was construed as offensive and people turned out in droves is just we got to go forward in a\nPosition in the business yeah and so something guy people\nStill have that moral compass share where we as the church I think we need to appeal to a deeper level is assessing ... [noise]\nWell I think you hit on a very important point in our theology namely that we have in a ... each of us\nThe image of God we were made that the image and like this of God\nAnd that image is still there and the hunger for be connected to God is still there unfortunately that hunger is being diverted to things other than God the need to be at peace that need to have friends that need to be loved\nWe're looking for in places that are not good for fill that need\nMore satisfaction we ... we never wherever we go on when we go into these fantasies at all these movies\nAnd those are war stuff and all this businesses is to substitute the reality of God and his understanding of things on the angels and other people that we recognize Israel\nWere substituting him for all these characters that are made up and put on screen and we get hung up with it I mean they're people who are just fascinated with uh all this fantasy\nThere again they buy more books they buy more things associated with these people I mean like what is going on here", "show_name": "Orthodoxy Perspective", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "21"}
