your guest\nThere you're very welcome to guess could talk a little bit about your um along valley of the night of county area and what what has gone on here in the past\nWell there's a broader question do did any of the murders happen in that area bill\n... no ... ... ... did\nThe uh uh although he would probably like through that area and Eighteen Ninety eight\nUh but uh it was cold cold a lot of\nThe year and he he didn't he didn't read all ... some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never for half the year we've limited to South Korea um\nThe uh that area is a interesting because it it's always been a hotbed\nOf um [noise] a reformist motion or a movement or it's as you've no doubt no\nA a a a one of the foundation areas of the women's rights movement the uh uh is is uh that exact area upstate New York but also many um\nReligious movements from the nineteenth century actually I'm a native from that part of the country I don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument in true crime that the ... the ... the murders and unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and then they tend to also then grow back out of it again which I was kind of book it's poetic they're interesting Doug is in New Jersey on ... east of the Rockies for Bill James go ahead\nYes good afternoon gentleman a pleasure to speak with the last ... hours of uh we have this show on cable it's called um uh give me a second hair um mysteries in America and they each

a train yard in Chicago\nAnd ah [noise] along the shore on this one particular train ride and I came in and out of this yard um\nThey had four or five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd there was I Believe a total of five bodies found and um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and look at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly till he white you know till\nHe retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all yeah they um\nUh I I I Know exactly it it's not Chicago technically but the um as Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that's the case you're referring to it it's a\nEliot Ness uh after that ah\nUh what was hired to try to solve a series of a ... and I'm\nAt right here on the name by which the yet right is\nA crime series is known but they actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes that I'm like in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... if they were\nThey were axe murderer as they were directed to train the but it it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that here's would um I I I I knew the case you speaking of ... to become the public\nWould have to go to the public safety officer public safety commissioner of Cleveland after Chicago um and those I thought were murders mostly of women again that they were talking about this as being sort of an American river um and that they were\nThey were all man they've all been voted one woman\n... the Russian government will get very interesting I we have time for John in Long Beach California and then we're going to have to wrap it up or go ahead John\nOkay thanks I'm not going to go about a nice to see again but but I think hey a bill the guy in a in Cleveland out here in LA I'm a longtime journalist out here they think he might have been a suspect in the black guy you're killing a LA enough thought that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed or a she if she did it she used to play to the acts and you said the other guy used to be blunt end so that would be I guess that'd be something else against it but I Want to ask you real quick did they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if\nYou're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell all types of stuff like that I mean\nThere had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about him later he just\nBlew into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was you know when you when you buy\nBuy it that's a really big or it the first crime everybody\nKnew everybody knew what he looked like and he was a very unusual looking man but\nFor some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can find no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of and posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west in the same era\nThe it was ... it was common to do drawings of criminal in that case there are drawings of the a police inspector who was in charge of the\nCave drawing for the house and he tried to use it all can set the house on fire and there's a drawing of the oil cash\nBut none of them are very ... it listed Bill James I Would just running out of time but that's why this is why people should listen to the show and then go by the book the Mets and the train discovering America's most elusive serial killers so enjoyed this conversation so grateful that you make time for us\nUm and uh and I look forward to in an updated version of this if you ever decide to the\nAh but in the meantime thank you I look forward to bumping into you Kansas on my way they're going to take my friend uh Nathan again and also to Ritchie Flores who's been kind enough to host me here in Phoenix in the meantime day used to um uh [noise]\n[noise] three years ago\nMaking a murderer became less a TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice than it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of rebuilding them\nOr to removing a murderer is now on the free I our radiolab just open the up and have a guy\nOr where we come from we all experience difficulties in mind [noise]\nMilitary veterans now that sometimes it takes ... determined to make it during the\nWeather is obvious physical challenges bore struggles in the inside it takes strength to ask for help when you need\nI knew that I had to get support\nNot just for me but for the sake of my wife and kids\nSee this is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine at\nNova or faculty or rock stars we're talking best selling author who writes scholars and professionals with deep industry experience [noise] they'll teach adults don't you start up here for patients foil a cyber attack I\nDon't think you're settling with an education\n... double duty A. G. W. A. T. A. G. H. D. Worcester and I argue radio station [noise]\nSunrise soon on a city that saw little sleep I'm Del Walters Fox News day one on one of the deadliest days in Pittsburgh history a little more than twenty four hours ago Robert Bauer as a lone gunman opening fire inside a synagogue killing eleven and wounding sick\nSo so in that she used the word connect and connect people with each other and with Christ in the courage to couldn't\nShe'll and historical office as well as a and all of the ask a life of the world to come because this person has called quest to love that serves God's people and a\nSays is visible so that connected us with Jesus Christ you hold is fear for the love\nAnd we say that this bishop this individual uh\nHas been a annoying to defeat will laying on of hands from the time of the apostles 'til now so those are just\nGoing to make myself a bishop in the mall where am I bet you that much but you're not going to be authentic [laughter] what are the out to buy cars though the Jersey Stevie made up is that it yeah right right uh though it's interesting when [laughter] it depends\nOn how ... how sharp your you know the soccer born every minute it's a bottom say that it was you might be able to get by a of\nThe of the some Protestant denominations they don't use the word bishop they use the word regional minister okay\nBecause they want to stay away from anything good scope ... uh but the fact is you need someone\nTo oversee an area territory and ... and the fact one of my college friends became a regional minister and when he told me he was now a little bit of that responsibility as all now you're a bishop [laughter]\nSo bishop is someone who has responsibility for overseeing sector secular area but he's also in communion with other bishops and having connectivity to other bishops keeps him on track so he doesn't go off the deep end\nYou know that's a big difference they just ... yeah it's one of his good to see if what if this could just see in one dish is higher than another\nIs one church in body of Christ when Jesus Christ one's a father who ... who sees more churches ones first is ...\nIn any way for you because they sort of the one lady of Christ but there's a whole discussion you were we fishing guide ... churches in New England\nYes and uh he was talking about the uh the sacrament so if you will a\nAnd the Sacramento ... is a word that is from the Latin a translated from the Greek word which miss miss the early on\nIn the near earth rocks world of the there's the attempt to maintain and it has thank God for may ... from the time of crisis to keep the mystery of God alive\nTo keep the ... the unknown is of God alive or we say very clearly that God is beyond a\nExpression uh invisible\nIntangible inevitable we use these negative words to say that we don't fully understand who got really we no God but we don't know him fully or we might get there someday in our lives in the next the next world in\nWhich is the difference between eastern and western he allergy is inevitable that we can go down but I had this thing out as well as our first cat if I think in the\nWest is saying what it is yeah and uh so in the case and we don't mix religions but as a\nWork in the far east of the doubt the AOL and it begins by the same way that can be name is not the way\nTo like buy some but I think of a vision of relationship is\nWell this idea of the mystery of God we take from our Hebrew brothers it's there in the Old Testament that's there in the early years of the um um scriptures\nUh that the ...\nThat God is beyond our full understanding and that we as mortals can never understand fully the immortal one\nSo that's usually a good thing\nIs probably a good thing because otherwise then you'd be God [noise]\nYou know you or you think maybe we're [noise] so anyway so the question is what about sacrament so what about in the studio and uh we unfortunately have the tendency\nOf saying they're only seven sacrament ghosts and new and our our brothers in the Catholic World have seventh documents and so we say we got those same sacrament says but the idea of a sacrament is God's working in our lives\nI mean if you think about the question and I think as a courtesy and to be polite and to try to interact with folks and share the\nLove of clay we we engage in news usage is but if you're asking me how many of the mysterious ways by which has communicates himself as human beings\nMany many ways\nThat this will say this one was history but the shots to questions [noise]\n\nGot accident many different ways with many different people at the zoo church\nWe recognize certain things that I just provide you know what's funny to Michael they're simple things a water at the baptism\nOf oil or the enormity of red\nLifted rather than why these very simple things there's such a beautiful magnificent south\nAnd in the world is the opposite is is these lavish production is the outcome always kind of leaves you want to see it was about ... understanding of the city of is simple elements within the beautiful like\n[noise] what was what we're talking about here is that uh I think we need to be I'm quoting here from\nHis talk he\nSays it a dictionary of Greek Orthodox father Nick on poetry out across writes that the terms duty on is a composite of the verb meal which means to close ones eyes for the purpose of protecting them\nBudget that closing one size but that's where the word listeria ... closing your eyes and the holy mysteries we're closing our eyes from an extraordinary vision of the living eternal God\nMysterious denotes the wheel and action of God which is beyond the understanding of man beyond what we are allowed to see\nThe mysteries in other words are God's actions in our lives which we are protected from seeing where we see them we could be blinded can you imagine that blinded by God's glory like our eyes would be lined up by the sun if he tried to look at it\nDirectly you can't do that you also I should go blind right seeing God would surely leave us with out\nThe fence with expose the Kassem between our central state to the glory of God in God's mercy towards us as he chooses not to manifest themselves in a more tangible than when his word became flesh and walked among us and now he hides in the elements of the sacrament this re straight on God's part is a mercy towards us\nNow let me go open up a little bit more uh\nWe know the Christ shown like the bright sun on the trans figured himself on tape or he showed his apostles Peter James and John who he was ... you know his his divine nature\nAnd others say change the past and the and their\nPotential to win this reality changed and he actually he was\nHe was always the time but had he walked around the earth like that all the time he would've blinded people ride he wouldn't have been able to communicate with people that she had shown his full divinity all the time here she's\nIn Hebrew Bible US Census puts his hand to protect those ... ... Abraham see right right\nUm no one who was seen God is lives right\nSo what\nThis seems to suggest that while it because you want to go back to what you said about the the the sacrament so the mystery\nIn each of the sacrament in each of the mystery as we said the orthodox world God is acting when I marry people I said look I'm not your not marrying each other and I'm not marrying you God is marrying you [laughter]\nI'm just the agent time just the deputy here who's doing the performance there but you're being married by God when you were baptized is not me who's baptize you [noise] it's God who's baptized that you're being brought into his death and so he could rise in his is a resurrection\n... we've got to say I marry or I'd advise you ... says in God so so is that of ties in to the father son [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Orthodoxy Perspective", "city": "Worcester", "day": "28"}
