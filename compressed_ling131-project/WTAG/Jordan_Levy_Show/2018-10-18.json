Mediterranean marketplace actually is going to be um my co host for the first six shows we are going to be talking about at hiatus Mediterranean marketplace mhm first show was this past Saturday um we talked about favorite fall flavors\nHold on a second Miriam higher who've I've had in this studio many many times is ditching me for you\nYes yes marry him I did many many shows together um for the

before she was getting to know and and I'll seriousness a Merriam height or is\nIs probably one of my favorite people to talk food with because she along with with myself we really have a passion for food and so we can sit there and we can and go back and forth and we come up with these great ideas and so it made perfect sense for me or am I going to be the co hosts for the first ...\nAnd everybody is kind of sick of the same old same old as far as you know and I were going to have hamburger foreigners enemy hotdogs says on friday and right you know et cetera et cetera but\nWith spices you know when I think of ... when I when I think of the Roman when you go in there well it's most delicious and you know what I mean I absolutely so I'm sure Marion will bring um quite a a wide variety of topics mhm not just Middle Eastern stuff but stuff that comes\nWith the ending um what they do in their store they this Saturday shows is going to be primarily about homemade prepared foods that you can go in and just take from the refrigerator and go home and bake so\nSo Jean made yeah but not cook\nExactly so they they've they've really made shopping at ... easy if you have five minutes or an hour you can go in and find what you need\n... and let's face it with\nUm most families today with two people working the days of the leave it to beaver father knows best and those shows where\nDad was working the kids were coming home from school and mom was there with the apron wrapped around her and pearls and hurled sent me an every every air place yes with an apron on as well um those those are pretty much gone and\nUm you know then you get home both people are working then you get home and the kids have to go to soccer practice they've got to go to a choir practice they've got to go to ballet\nI'm having fit your family time in ... right meal time is the only time in real time is also health time because I'm sure that you'll get into some of the shows about how food impact your health\nOh absolutely and how how um your health impacts your food I mean it can go both ways because there's so many different dietary needs out there now with the social environments that we have\nThat you know you really need to sit down and figure out what you can do for each person in your family because what what makes one doesn't what one is allergic to one's not so we found challenges in my own household\n'cause I have a son that has um a an allergy a severe allergy and so we really had to sit down and figure out how to\nGet snacks to our kids how to make sure he was educated to not do this\nOr tastes death and you know it was a learning curve for us so that's why you know with the first six shows that at ... um they have everything that you're looking for for dietary needs there as far as gluten free items and and races and what have you so I mean it's a really good place to go\nYou know it's amazing how in the last generation um these allergies have either been diagnosed properly or or they've appeared because I Know growing up there was no such thing as as a ... gluten free of even\nTalk about our social environment right now and and you know everything that's happening with acid rain and things about that really eat your body has to try and adjust to the chemical changes in the air so I'm sure that has\nA lot to do with it and the chemical changes in their\nAlso lead to chemical changes in the food that you eat in the water yeah you know and I know there was this big push a few years ago about grass fed beef and then I talked to a person who owns a butcher shop and they said was well you know there's kind of just a marketing thing because grass fed beef all it means is the last thirty days of their life\nThey ate grains and not grass yeah um but people think that\nYou know the animal has been raised in that the whole time free range free range and and I argue with my wife all the time about free range ... uh you know versus regular eggs and I've tried to to trick or a few times usually gets it right 'cause the 'cause the\nYou know the the eggs that are five dollars a pound somehow the color is a little bit different\nI'm I'm Still trying to figure out how the company um it's kind of like the Chiquita banana people how they could grow those bananas with the ... the the sticker right on the\nOld that they do amazing things\nNow and how those eggs can have the egg land best oh yeah you know stamped right on the ground coming right out of the job\nI'm a big fan of just non pasteurized eggs just going right to the farm stand in and buying them I think a cake made with a non pasteurized eggs in one of the best things in the world\nMm [noise] um ... that's a very interesting topic that you bring up

show news radio five eighty Ninety four point nine FM and I made reference to Washington because joining us this half hour for our D.C segment is our\nUnofficial Washington correspondent Jeff Taylor Jeff welcome back to the door and let me show here in West or\nGood afternoon John how are you\nI'm doing Great Hey not much ah [laughter] it's kind of jumped to say there's not much to talk about on in politics today but um\nEverything is just going hot and heavy down in DC and you're the one who has all the insight on the inside the beltway scenario and um I Want to throw some I'm going to throw some words out to you Jeff and you just talk from there okay\nWe'll do it a little bit differently okay or else I'll just throw names out and then you just talk and say what the first thing that comes to your mind about about these names ready first name\nYou're ready\nI Am Hillary Clinton\nWell she just won't go away and and and that's a real problem for the Democrats now you know traditionally uh uh the standard bearer of the party or stay around for four years until there's a new standard bearer so technically Hillary is still the leader of the Democratic party\nAnd you know that would be okay if she was out there talking about a a good solid democratic issues but my goodness every time she opens her mouth it's about something that is completely off message\nOr whatever you think about a Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and that land all ah everybody on the planet\nAnd I wake up and maybe if you will in a scandal that wasn't a scandal that was consensual activity I don't I I very my listeners here in viewers are very upset that you would refer geneticist scandal I think you should\nTo the people of the United states for using that word scandal\nWhile the love affair between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and if if if it's OK to say love affair uh I think around the globe that everybody would consider that if the most powerful man in the world\nAnd the most of the smallest person in the U.S federal government and in turn we're in a in a relationship whether it was consensual or not\nMost people on the planet except for maybe seven or eight people in central Massachusetts might say that that was clearly an abuse of power if especially in this me to Iraq where you have Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and people like that\nSo for her up for her to come out and say it was not an abuse of power makes the standard bearer of the Democratic party kind of not on the fame game plan as the rest of the world so I think a lot of Democrats especially three weeks before an election would rather have her\nEllison if you're going to talk about tax cuts or or the size and scope of government wine but my God to bring up Bill Clinton and abuse of power just don't do that\n... you know what I just wasn't my ... one of my original topics but I Will bring this up um\nAre going on tour the coming to Boston and New York and Washington et cetera et cetera but they're being promoted by live nation which is the largest concert promoter\nIn the in the United states um are there any precedents where past presidents precedents on presidents have gone around speaking and um\nYou know charging a feat I don't and I don't mean the fees that Clinton would get from a corporation but selling selling seats like to like to uh Bill Cosby show um have you ever done it before\nNow I'm not familiar with that and of course you've got President Obama now cutting a deal with Netflix to do some kind of a in some kind of a show so I think in the age of communication and social media and just an explosion of a TV radio and and communications you'll you'll find more of that\nNow people are actually doing it and over the last forty eight hours if you do a Google News you will see five or six different instances where a Democrat or a Democrat operative have the hack\nPhysically attacked a Republican candidate for off\nLet's move a little bit off of a a female Democrats for a moment to a um to a person whose name is in history and I'm tell us what Jimmy Carter is talking about lately\n\nOr German listen Jimmy Carter he is probably close to Ninety years old now he's he's still very active and uh but you know he he takes the shots every once in a while and today he decided he was going to say that Brett Kavanaugh is on there to serve on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd uh I'm I'm assuming that you're referring to the fact that I Believe that you know Jimmy Carter will in fact go down as one of the worst presidents in us history and here's a guy who who just simply was not a very good president calling Brett Kavanaugh who's an enormously accomplished\nA professional and public servants are on there so you know my feeling was if if if if the worst president thinks he's on that then he's probably extremely that serve on the Supreme Court\nWho's got a caller here what's what's the name Kim Tim Tim Tim welcome to the door and\nLet me just tell them crawling John how are you ... and that was pretty well that's a new name\nThat's the name you know who I Am to me here Yeah Yup yup yup discuss this is Jeff many times a year and I I I've already heard things is or frankly I don't plan to be fair and balanced\nLet's let's hear going ahead with that but um it's just we we didn't plan is to him I thought you were at the Cape a back and forth oh okay so go ahead I'm defend what\nYou think is to send them all\nAll the kinds of all in the world the Clintons for over your Bill Clinton for the respect for all the presidents\nWe've had as I said the president's so\nI'm happy that he's campaigning for Democrats these in the class it was far outweigh Hillary Clinton was in office for a terrific secretary as safe as well as an excellent from the New York so I guess for them to be healthier rock yeah cutting says I'm a class with Jeff I'm not I think that's a very positive\nGyms let me ask you this um should she be saying we can't be civil until we win again and in was that misquoted is that it was that the message that people should be\nPresented presenting go ahead Tim\n\n... [laughter] but\nYeah I think we've we've lost some Jeff you still hear on the air yep yeah I Do must be on a in a phone in a car but I'm I'm while we're on the topic of\nOf um we talked to a Jimmy Carter oh the other name I had written down here and I'm I Know that there's really not much to say about this lady but I just wanted to put it up there any way I'm Senator Warren I'm In her recent claim about her heritage I'm\nI'm looking at it and I'm saying who do you believe you are so in order to find the truth I went from Fox and I went to CNN and I saw that they're even saying you know uh you know what forty generations ago Irwin however it is I'm\nA lose Warren is the topic Jeff go ahead follow up\nWell Senator Warren a you know certainly not a cup of tea for Republican or right of center people or a conservative and we already know that but right now she's almost persona non grata in the Democratic party and again it comes down to this\nThree week uh you know three weeks before an election Democrats want to be talking about health care and they want to be talking about you know and other very pro middle class uh uh topics and here comes a center Warren who apparently\nWho apparently tipped off nobody in the hierarchy of the Democratic party that she's going to come out and claimed the cheese one one thousand thirty twenty four percent a Native American\nWhich is laughable on its face uh and uh it's now been up for a five day uh well what four day a news story\nWhere in fact they want their democratic candidates not responding to Senator Warren but their own campaigns and their own messages it's all about message\nI I was going to tell you that are right now it appears that two hundred and six Republicans are locked in for reelection about two hundred Democrats are locked in for re election in the house\nAnd so there are thirty feet that are true toss up I Will say that there are thirty seats and they're all Republicans so that that is of concern to Republicans\nBut the fact is when you get off message in those thirty toss up seat and start talking about senator war and as a Native American that that must just drive and and I think we now know with CNN and MSNBC\nIt drives these pro democratic uh news stations and and the party crazy because they're way off message\nAnd they've got to pick up at least twelve or Thirteen\nOf those thirty puff up seats in order to get control of the house right now every message and Senator Warren is way off message\nInteresting interesting um we got a a few minutes we had when we got a minute before break and then we come back we'll talk to him as well because him in his call back um\n...\nWell Kanye ah hey he's a he's ever since he took a slap in the Senate ... President Bush II it really is not my cup of tea but he he's been a very open in a supporter of President Trump and the way the Democrats\nHave treated Kanye West\nAh yeah it it it's almost as though listen con yeah you're supposed to think can speak the way we tell you too and I think that's enough of a massive or illicit whether you like President Trump or dislike President Trump at your own particular brand\nBut then they go out and just a you know criticize them and and borderline call him a racist or actually backing President Trump ...\nHey a a good for you ... for being your own man frankly and making the call on your own and not being bullied into doing something that otherwise you wouldn't do so uh\nHey Kanye is a quite a unique individual I'll say that\nExactly so hey we're gonna take a break right now when we come back we've got some callers on the line in a Jesse take the calls that'd be great and um we want to talk about a couple of other things in a few minutes that we have after the break into Jordan let me show my name is John in vitro we'll be back\nHe's joined and let me show you tell them I guess his son in law when you tell the truth is always says find use radio five eighty Ninety four boys ...

what we really want to tell our listeners interviewers out there that folks if you've got a reunion coming up and you know you generally Thanksgiving weekend is the big big weekend for reunions because people come back to their families and\nYou know back to the home town which there from for Thanksgiving and in that type of thing um if you've got a reunion I Am sure you guys would would suggest also just go to it don't worry about what you look like don't worry about the fact that your your hair is a different color and and all that other stuff\nUm would you guys agree with me on that\nYeah definitely a lot of people worry about well what am I going to say I'm going to be in a conversation and all of a sudden they'll kind of end and it's going to be awkward it it doesn't happen you talk to these people then the next somebody comes up to you and they start talking and it's more or less people just like with each other and\nWe just moved to another conversation so easily it's surprise it really a surprise and it's understandable why people would feel that way and you know I I I get it you know just you\nKnow when I go there were ... more ... um well I'm I'm a cool\nPhone from 'em so now I mean that was\nIt was part of growing up\nWhile the higher growing up right and you learn to live with it if I went on for the column I\nFelt like I was that was from I get older you have to let go of it in front of everyone and you know it's in regular life\n'cause you know like I posted something on Facebook earlier this week in anticipation of this and I said um if you weren't part of the in crowd um\nAnd you know what back then everything was collect you know you had you had the athletes you had the the scholars you had the kids that were in in shop class

the idea of at least as far as the women are concerned put their maiden names down because they're married names wouldn't\nWouldn't ring a bell yeah after fifty years name tags were very uh very integral part of the evening would you agree\nDefinitely 'cause what happens if you don't know the person the second they say their name their face like clothes and it's right there you know what

church to get to the Italian church\n[laughter] yeah the ... and I ...\nRealize there were a celebration of life and I think that's why everyone really interact with them because we have to realize that it failed early yet on the connection here like you would get people to death with their ... close friends and but\nWe were kind of I I sat with someone I I didn't know very well in high school and we have such a great time at all what what what has been going in his life and we got invited down to earth if we're ever\nGoing to be perfect you know interesting Janice I'm I didn't attend with
