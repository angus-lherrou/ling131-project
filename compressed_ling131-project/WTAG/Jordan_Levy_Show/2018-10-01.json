I mean really early on says there's one\nOr how much people can do how much do you remember how will make a function\nThe progress has to another stage rushed to another stage if you're too shippers you go to a stage where the folks are what All right and that's unfortunately this is the will to the shift of right now with the ... of the church and they haven't had the syllable word that we can just do\nThe ... the one that draws a treasure ship but that doesn't mean the quality of life shouldn't be affected in Israel right you get the maximum all with the quality of life should be\nAbsolutely and I think in the beginning stages that's when we really want to support people who have um the dementia because they can still do many things on their own but one of the first science might be with banking that uh we know financial you know dealing with um checks and and so on\nPaying bills or say to build ... ...\nActually so that is a telltale sign that maybe if your bank recognizes that you know now you're slipping and some of these areas they could start to help you with that which would really help you succeed instead of what's driving or becoming dependent upon somebody or really getting yourself into trouble how\nAbout his relationship of of course I'm sure this is all part of it um with the family I mean because many people that\nHave early onset dementia run denial when there are approached by family members are all all hell rituals were told me I feel so much over there was this is an independence level change right ...

[noise] well\nI think there's there's a variety of services out there so the senior center might see someone who's very healthy or in the beginning and then as they start to have some declined whether it's physical cognitive you know they might make a referral to elder services which the area where I work um we might get a call from a family caregiver who said\nYou know I go to calls that there was a concern whether it was the police department or the fire or something that triggers other people are getting involved and so what you're you're looking to do is get to the cause of what's going on and then figure out what do they need help with how can we keep\nThem in the community as long as possible and his safety safely as possible\nTo pay for this or this or she\nSo elder services with her as a private nonprofit agency that um we look at a folks income but we also look at what services they might be I'm\nEntitled to um if they are qualified for mass house we have respite programs we have sliding fee so we really want people to call us and just have a conversation whether it's through an options counselors membership we're all\nMedicare does not unless I'm because that's a skilled they if you were to be discharged from the hospitals and required some\nShows ... home or else exactly for a period of time is short periods the physical therapy ...\nAnd a job to job sort of before\nThe occupational exposure for in a senior center up\nSo there's a lot of educational programs for both seniors and their children I'm Somali abducted but some coming set and ways to managing your memory open to the public gets free and people can come up and learn about that and the all time is association office a lot of programs at the senior center on again at no cost\nI we also get grants and we thank A.

going to come out with chocolate\nAs one of the programs that we just started as an eight week pilot program and funded in part by a a pie\nAnd it's a once a week program for eight weeks for hours and it is respite for the ... so they can drop their loved one offs and hang out at the senior Center for hours we do activities the headlines exercised\nAnd wants to eight weeks is over we're going to continue on\nYour yeah so that's going to be like a deck yes\nWell it's incorporated into the senior center so they're in with the general population for some of the programs um but it doesn't replace in adult they health program or anything like that but it's something to help people and we can only take on seven people and\n... right now is that by based on us\nCertain degree of of the ability\nOf the higher functioning people need to be independent it's mainly supervision that we provide right for it it's got off to a great star it's wonderful yeah what else you're doing so we now have you know [laughter] have a memory cafe that's been running for\nAlmost three years now after years hitting our third year but I'm Debbie can speak to the memory ...\nSo this is a place where someone\nWith um the dementia and their caregiver can come up to spend time at the senior center we meet the third Tuesday of every month is is free at two o'clock to three thirty and these are there are\nMore than ... eighty five cafes throughout the state of Massachusetts we have the most in the country last I heard and this is a wonderful way for a we talked about isolation and this is a great place for the kid gave her to come\nThat they're with other caregivers and they can bring their loved ones that we don't talk about the disease but we put out some resources at a table so that they can get information Patty\nAnd I both volunteer there along with some other volunteers so we start the cafe off with refreshments in conversation for the first half hour and then we go into some form of entertainment or activity that really we were trying to engage um the the person with the dementia\nBut it's just a great opportunity for people to get out and be with others and also they can't give us get a little break there with others and not having to worry even though their loved one is still there\nBut so are there that's being redundant but you know everything you can do it was just it was just two parties Shia yeah you know you've got to use that the patient then you've got to kill you and I don't know who's going at worst\nIn in a as was mentioned a lot of them are couples and so it's the husband bringing the wife or vice versa um so it really is important that they get that break or they've got to go do some errands or and they need to be able to do with the rest of the program you\nKnow that they're safe now that they're in a place that the kid for a while they go out and do their Iran's would take care of go to their doctors appointment or whatever it might be a so that they can stay healthy and and get done what they need to do so it really is just trying to provide some of those supports the folks and\nYou know one other thing that we've talked about on your
