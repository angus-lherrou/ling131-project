lean and I didn't call or Helen [laughter] that's what people do yeah exactly so this way here by having you introduce yourself and takes the heat off for me to go to do that you're the executive director and you've been with us once before and we had a great response\nTo the information that you shared with us but for those of us for those folks that didn't have a chance to listen on the radio or or catch it on TV tell us what Fifteen dash forty or\nIs what it does and um [noise] how long it's been around\n'em so Fifteen forty connection is a nonprofit organization with Ruth right and what store I should say what's right what's um what's that what's the math um and what we do is we teach people how to detect cancer early and we do it really for one reason and that\nSave lives so we work with high schools colleges um within wellness programs we do a lot on social media and it's all about getting people to recognize the most common cancers symptoms and knowing when to seek health care and how to work with their doctor to get that the best care\nShelf so you're not a word in say the least you're not a\nDrug company that is behind this that is just a masking\nThemselves as I'm a public service organization and All right\nNo not at all in fact it it's all good intentions um I Know many of your viewers and listeners will know if it costs on family and kids are off when you're at uncovered this problem that that the late diagnosis was causing a lot\nAnd so he and his wife Nancy in their entire family decided you\nKnow after an extensive search to look for somebody that was doing something about it that you know what this is something we can brushed under the rug now that we know what's going on than we need to address the problem so they found that it is yes that\nAnd what we call them our T phones here\nIn the terms Fifteen dash forty word is that what is the significance of those numbers\nFor the question I'm so when Jim and Nancy found this problem originally it was through the data that that showcase it mainly who fifteenth forty year old says teens and young adults and when you think about that age group you know they have less preexisting conditions and it's an easier to study\nBut um that that ten years ago and they were first introduced to the data\nIt then I'm since Nineteen Seventy five that they had seen improvements in Kansas survival rates for the ... and a big reason why was\nThe early ... weren't catching it early enough you\nKnow the lean year that the education and outreach director tell us roughly ... you're a ... interview for your job again tell us elsewhere or job is\nTo say I probably have a better idea of the time and when I originally that I'm so my my primary role is it around your partnership development so I spend a lot of my time going out finding new places where we can share education programs out there that schools that are that corporate wellness ... fire department\nAnd I'm I'm also over the the um the education program so looking at our content and put a content delivery compost contend a creation and your content\nOr again like how we work with your partner to make sure that we're sharing our educational materials that's why they if they can\nYou know this three stepped detect mhm I'm a aspect that's yeah prominently displayed on your website um tell us what that is\n... yeah so that's really the cornerstone of our education so we call it three steps the tax test you know they are and how that catchy name they can remember it but it's really all we say that guy to early detection so the idea of how to use the benchmark hair how how do you notice health changes\nAnd what you do you do when you do to help changes\nUm you know and we share that with stories from cancer survivors who share their experiences with us so we can share him out\nI'm early detection\nIs probably your best first medicine your best first medicine that said that the right way\nYeah that was the most effective medicine out there and if you look at melanoma right which is an aggressive form of skin cancer and you find it early survival rates are Ninety nine percent right mhm\nYou find that late that Trump's all the way down to twenty percent\nWill think without early versus late on that particularly with the like I said\nOne cancer so you just notice them all changing and surgery or just removing\nThem all ... um and and margins around it can take that can't throw away and you're here okay right you know and I\nLater on it it's gone into your body more maybe there are two very popping up elsewhere and your body is a threat\nI mentioned before uh and and I wasn't joking with the ... I just thought it was when I said sunburn there there are certain people from ethnic backgrounds that burn a lot easier\nThan um than others you know generally the light light skinned people that you see 'em on beaches and they've got sweat suits and hats and you know blankets wrapped around them I'm the son is not necessarily your your best friend when it comes to cancer is\nNot always um there's some great countries out there though I'm One of those people that burns or easily you know um\nSo yeah no you you have to you know if you've if you've had a number of fish when you're younger of severe thunder and that does increase your risk of cancer so you have to be careful\nSure in um occupational circumstances certainly determine exposure to percentages\nAnd I know again I'll go back to my father again working in the shipyards in Wednesday in the Nineteen forties I'm with asbestos around but I'm told that no I'm the modern day people who are most susceptible to occupational\nUm [noise] a bad environments are firefighters can you tell us lean a little bit about your work with firefighters and the issues that face\nAt totally so it's on the air listeners may have seen that in a lot of news coverage recently about the rates of cancer and the fire service and how author study they're coming out around a fire fighter getting cancer at a higher rate than the general public on survival rates being lower\nSo we actually started getting programs late fire departments almost a year ago now\nWe saw these reports and started talking about our materials which we primarily been doing in school and said this method of Information Act is certainly something that we could share with the firefighters and information they can use for their own health\nSo we started with their a fire department of actually our first full department program and we went in there last spring and were able to share our program where the entire department though is like\nThirty ... over the course of four weeks on end talking of the firefighters about\nAbout the three theft attacked and important that early detection\nThey think with a lot of the training that are going on in the fire service now the conversation is round prevention so what are things that firefighters can be doing in order to stay healthy you know changes in in the job from any of the way it was done ten years twenty or Thirty years ago\nTo try and keep the guy's healthier on and then they did all around the idea of\nWhere they have you noticed how change it and act on them and even more than that why does that matter\nSo showing that it's important to try and stay healthy but even if you do everything right you still might get sick you know what are the things that you can do to get yourself a better chance of getting back to health if something does happen to think greatly started and with her and had been expanding programs pretty rapidly we've done on a number\nOf department and the other way from Webster the way to Watertown I'm working our way down for Ninety five although we are in Milford a couple of weeks ago Franklin so it's been really exciting to get to the program\nWith ... perfect we've got to take a break right now but if you guys hang with us um I've got a couple of more important questions and especially in ... to our viewers and our listeners this is W ... news radio five eighty Ninety four point nine of them my name is John to be drawn this was the door and let me show will be back with more with the Fifteen forty connection right after these important words\nUsage or didn't let me show\nAnd we have to know it has to realize you have to live on lies not feel not in ... what the minute we let our guard down his use radio five eighty and Ninety four boy died after ... gene or\nThey might use it overnight what's new today on the free I her radio\nFor decorating the house for just sitting here in our home games by new play ... with labor in mind when you know and your days\nIn swing mainstream break out all our great zillion party ... whether you're at home or the stadium the new I our radio ... collections that come out and\nJordan over here for Thomas tree woods insurance did you know the woods insurance agency offers a pie Massachusetts auto in home insurance replenished rock and bumpy hill insurance\nHey happy members Massachusetts can sign up for on on home insurance I contacted a up the hometown service and would you Sharon's agency ... home insurance a bundle your auto home insurance and get the discount city up his name is ...\nIt's the best of both worlds a nationally ranked insurance company for me I'd be then off his hometown personal service and claim support on right here in which does to Thomas Jay was insurance agency\nContract jak woods on Walter Conlin today Thomas Jay was insurance agency so you're no obligation consultation with insurance at five and wait for them and five five five nights for for that is finally seven five five five nine will for more information available online and was insurance dot com\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to the door and let me show we have our friends here from Fifteen forty connection and ladies um [noise] what can the general public due to find out more about your organization but more importantly to get you into I'm into more and more groups and organizations to speak to\nYeah I think that the guy questions that we're always looking for more places to go and and we would just add that people reach out to us through the website that website that great\nFirst stop WWW dot\n... dot org gets more information and we have an info page on there\nSo you can reach out to it and say you want to get involved you have an idea of where we can go and then I'll get back to you quickly on and we're always we're always looking for you or your fire departments new companies that want to bring us and we can share of the program with their employees I'm really open to expanding\nAnd we can run programming for on faith but also throughout than ours so for a place\nStay yeah company and I say\nOn an intra day but I've got people work from home I add a whole bunch of different offices we find that that's a great way to be able to reach 'em to reach everyone and then they get really easy for people to access the information\nSo what would be the parameters that you set for um the groups that you would actually physically send representative out to how many ... is there a minimum number of people or does it have to be during daytime you know working hours or or a [laughter] ...\nYes yes oh that's a great question they were really it really that a case by case basis so I had a pen on\nThe the people the where we are going and we had the ... so we want to make sure that anyone who is interested in getting our early detection education we find a way to make it work for that and so\nFor example for some fire department the only time they can get everyone together at seven o'clock at night so we figure out a way to get on that seven o'clock at night um\nThere were people saying well then they didn't interview the two parties involved in this um is that because they already testified under oath for several hours just prior to that\n[noise] well I mean in in in background investigations just so so uh you know your audience can understand um the political appointments\nThat the government makes are not necessarily political appointments but appointments to um offices as whether it's a\nUm you know attorney general's office so whether it's uh uh the Supreme Court um all of the backgrounds for for those federal offices um are done by the FBI\nNow basically speaking or the FBI has fifty six different field division [noise] okay and in each one of those divisions they have a squad it's called the applicant squad that does background investigations\nThey do background investigations on all these appointments that that are made they do background investigations on people that are have are filled out applications and to be FBI agents\nOr they do background investigations are on federal employees a that\nEvery five years they gave us a security is secret security clearances or you you have to do a background in five years so they they do this regularly and also um you know during election years from November\nTo a January ... is a very busy time\nBecause the new president\nA president that got elected is now a pointing and everybody that's appointed has to go through this long or a process where\nThey you know all of the leaves are run out and a a a document that created with all of these interviews\nUm and and uh what what happened\nWith the situation with Dr Ford\nWas there was already people that were assigned to the case\nOr whether it was probably run a um headquarters got the paperwork they sent it to probably in the field office or in Virginia to actually manage the case\nUm and and they went to the applicant squad\nBut but if interviews had to be done in California\nYou know you pick up the phone or get on your computer and send it to a field veiled division field office in California\nWho would then go in and that person was asked who would then get them all in all of these\nDone all er all of these I've done in person but but if if there was a hundred things that needed to get in a done in one day if the African squad\nHad twenty people while you would call a another Fifteen people in and say okay here's the two interviews you need to do today and get them done by the end of the day and that is in any field office\nIn the United states\nAnd it's there are forty legalized caches in forty different countries link a lab test Shay is an FBI agent that is working in a foreign country his offices in the embassy and he handles paperwork and leaves\nOn cases that originate out of the United states and and our FBI and investigations so they needed something done in England France\nYou know get on a computer or pick up the phone\nAnd that person is gonna is it can get done in a matter of hours I mean you know if you look at at what the how the bureau has function or in in the crisis time or things are happening\nUm hourly daily or because you you know you've got contacts\nAround the United states that are interviewing people uh in person and the ability to do it around the world in person\nNo no it's just you just joined us you were talking with retired an FBI agent Charlie ... and Charlie you've probably done several of these is if not hundreds of these um um interview self would that be correct\nYes yeah so I made over the course\nUm everybody has a has a shot and working on an applicant squad it usually comes comes out within the first three or four years\nBecause it forces you to be you know getting used to interview people because you're doing it every day every day every day as opposed to\nUm you know other things where um you you you're not into a million people every day and then when it gets busy it's very common to say okay you you for guys\nGet onto the applicant squad for three days get your twenty interviews done and then come back\nAnd that's kinda how it how it is you know and if they they need something done and the only time you you do it is eight nine ten eleven o'clock at night well that's why they they you know that's why they don't pay you know any overtime\n[laughter] totally let me ask you this question and make sure we get the terminology right\nUm experience that nobody in the media can ever replicate duplicate or or whatever so we want to thank you so much Charles for that\nAnd let you know that this is WTO gee it's the door and let me show my name is John ... and when we come back we're going back to Washington

doing great Jeff um\nI had an opportunity to watch the swearing in the quote unquote ceremonial swearing in last night in what I did was I watched it on one channel but uh periodically I Would switch it to other channels so I watched it on Fox and then I switched to CNN then I switched to MSNBC\nAnd Jeff I don't know if you were doing the same but I didn't know if I was watching the same broadcast based upon the comments that the that the panel of experts that were assembled and host of other networks I or what's going on in DC I'm a new ... what are they saying they're\nWell a hit list and that's the way the news media is now you get a change the channel and get a different point of view and and you never come down with the actual facts right when at the numbers but you know what actually is one of the fun part of today was that a\nA a Brett Kavanaugh heard arguments for the first time as a U.S Supreme Court justice and it was announced who he had chosen as is five a court and all five of them are women\nAnd you can imagine that the women are are the the brightest of the bright\nOr in law school and coming out of law school so I'm sure that put a number of Democrats back on their ill that for the first time in history\nA Supreme Court justice has five clerks or all women and good for bread on that account\n... now and her two two different\nSides of that story in one was that he had already decided on who these people would be a regardless of their gender prior to the hearings um or prior to this last round of hearings\nAnd the other said oh it's only a response to make him look good um have you heard any have you heard both sides of that story\nAh I haven't heard both sides of that story or the ... he is the ... he is reporting it appears right down the line where you know the by the pack whether he picked them before the hearing or after the hearing a\nLeave of the five he's going forward with a in his first year the Supreme Court justice so no matter what it looks pretty good\nAnd I wonder if they're going to be subject to an FBI background check to find out if they ever drink beer while in college\nWhile even at a isn't it a ... and ... in the whole thing that I was just reading an article\nAbout how the how you know Senator Sheldon Whitehouse got away perfectly clean you know here and here he is sitting on a committee overseeing the on the Judiciary Committee overseeing the nomination of a Supreme Court justice and he asked the nominee about part at\nA I Can't imagine you know not about judicial temperament not about how he would decide on a constitutional law decision you know ... and at at a ... got to be his most important hearing ever talked about Sheldon Whitehouse yep and in a poll vow Brett Kavanaugh's year book\nAnd makes a banning blow up of it yeah\nI don't know I don't know if you are listening on the radio or saw that on TV but I remember the day it was what two weeks ago just Thursday I was I'm driving back from Cleveland so I had a eight hours in the car or actually more hours in more than eight hours in the car so we listen to virtually every word of\nDr force testimony and then when just when I got home to west or the um\nUh Brett Kavanaugh came on and I saw a White House\nOr I switched to TV buys [laughter] and I saw a White House have one of his staff hold up a big\nUh enlargement of Kavanaugh's picture with the with the yearbook activity you know what the four years of high school activity under it and I said number one I Can't believe they did that and and the line of question was just amazing\nBut this is the same I'm a Senator Whitehouse that you're talking about the Marines\nThe marine hero right the Vietnam hero that at the same guy who's not\nAll that that bloom and all of a little bit of Sri blooming fill that strike embarrassed itself too but you know the the two New England\nBut they're only in every five years so it was that like a five year period that I'm from the from the first check to when the second one was\nFor me no there was no second check I had already left the administration so it was the first check and ah I'm not even sure how I did because by the time the the background check was done I had already moved on\nMm [noise] couple of other things that have taken place based upon what's happened in the ... in the past few days um did you see RPG on TV at all\nOr Ruth Bader Ginsburg no I didn't\n... I mean the poor lady um it it looked like she had pajamas on and she had she had gloves or mittens on 'em and really couldn't lift her head above her shoulder it but it's a lifetime appointment um yeah\nWell I don't think she's I don't think she's going to leave with President Trump in the White House and you know she has had some some or health scares and she is getting up in age she's she's she's got to be in her late eighties by now and so listen it's her own call it's their own decision she can leave one she wants\nBut obviously a you know a lot of people thought she'd leave during the Obama years and not allow that seat to go uh to someone who is more like her but uh you're right uh you know when you do see that Justice Ginsburg on TV boy it's a it's a\nI mean I feel bad for from from uh from just from a human perspective it doesn't look you know maybe she's maybe she's mentally there but physically I mean she couldn't even clapping and that was another thing that I think CNN said oh Clarence Thomas was the only one clapping\nUm is that an issue that that those guys are not supposed to clap those men and women are not supposed to clap\nWhile they're not supposed to clap during the state of the union address is that what you're saying\nWell I don't know but there were a couple of times last night when I'm there were were portions that oh a couple of the justices were clapping a light but\nI I don't I don't think that I don't think that's really all that meaning fall I mean the fact is he is now a member of of the Supreme Court\nOr the data done the house of representatives has not linked to impeach Brett Kavanaugh that's just a fun thing that the news media likes to do\nAnd not only that but ... if he would have to be removed from the bench by a two thirds vote in the U.S fed at that never going to happen so you know they can play these games all they want a let's get back to the Brett Kavanaugh is on the bench\nWell let's get on to more tax cuts let's get on to you know a a approving the budget for two thousand Nineteen let's get back to something normal the around\n... you know one of the things that I read today is that a Susan Collins is being a because of her vote\nThat I'm prominent people why I'd never heard of before are suggesting that uh if they owned restaurants\nDon't order Maine lobster don't order main squid don't order any fish don't order any seafood that comes from Maine and people are being told to cancel their summer vacation is included a trip to Maine\nI'm all in their throwing it back onto Collins' how do you respond to that crazy ...\nWho says that ah just come to the the adult you would think that someone who would recommend that would be an Eighteen year old kid sixteen year old kid who ginned up in a politically active\nBut when you when you actually work at the people who are screaming at the galleries and the fed it and they were asking the boycott Maine lobster either people in their forties and fifties these adults these are people who you think are sentient the these are people who\nBut sadly there some something going on in the Democratic party where I'm a uh the the the being an adult a is a ... be heating yeah it's it's being put in the back seat and crashing\nScratching the Supreme Court door or running around in ... all of them were around naked outside the Supreme Court the other day and again they're in their forties and fifties and they have children and they have responsibilities\nYou would you would think that they were sixteen and Eighteen year old kids doing this uh this is going to stop US Senator Rand Paul's wife ah was on a a interview the other night and she was saying that their lives are being a a a challenge\nYou know we now know that barren Trump the twelve year old kid of President Trump is it is being threatened Dr Ford was threatened the\nWe've got to tamp down but especially on the left when you have people just ... in the gallery and screaming at the hip or the ah at the hearing what is all about you just got up\nYou know one of those things that we've got to do and about uh about ten seconds or so it was take a break because um we're coming up to that moment but I Want you to stay with us for these few moments when we got to take these important messages and when we come back we want to talk about\nWhat's next for the United states how can we here we have Jeff Taylor on the phone with us from Washington DC this is WTO edgy isn't Jordan let me show my name is John to be drawn please stay with us\nThis is short and let me

the crazy things that are being done um than we check out on Facebook and other social media sites as well as um news sites um\nBut one of the things that I pointed out last night when I was watching the president\nAddressed the audience um when's he was going to introduce Cavanaugh\nI said I Wish you hadn't even brought up\nThe program the confirmation hearings and you ... and several other\nFolks blasted me saying he should bring it up because these people need to get kicked in the ... and you know we've been taking their baloney for too long um what's your thought on that\nActually mine was tongue in cheek I I'm I was completely on board that you go back okay everybody was like you're right you're right you're right I find it the\n... to ... not that it was it that you said I go to and we can't we can't say that on the radio but I think we just did a middle of well\nWould have just let it go in you know ... him anytime 'cause my feeling would have been if you didn't bring it up um you wouldn't have let them know that they got your vote\nYeah no I agree with you and and those are the kind of things that the you know I'm a I'm a supporter of President Trump on policy ideas policy I Believe in smaller government less taxes and I I think he's done a very good job I\nI like Gorsuch and Kevin all the two people put on the court but every once in a while in the in the in the news conferences and on the Twitter\nHe makes me whim and you're right he should not have brought up that point of view and then you know just moved on it should've been a celebration\nBut you know ... you know you asked the question before the break how do we get back together and some kind of a\nHarm um any\nKnow my background actually I'm a licensed clinical social worker and I've been practicing for a little over Fifteen Years working with kids who have a anxiety related disorders and through my work is a clinical social worker I had learned it okay and as\nA step by chance not by being a kid with it or anything like that but I'm\nAn older client that I had worked with his grandson had it but I ended up learning a lot about it and then it turned out that um [noise] my son my oldest son who's nine now he started experiencing rapid changes in his behavior heck OCD um regression\nAngry [laughter] rage ... that were so unusual for him\nUm and so I started to try to figure out what was going on ... and I hadn't thought about pandas out of it because it I had heard it was so rare and now I ... I didn't have anyone in my clinical practice at that time who had a a\nAnd but they can't say I figured it out on my on that my son actually did have an does either\nHe ended up testing positive for ... and then um [noise]\nI went down the rabbit hole of hand and hand does and now a five years later that I have dedicated my career to helping other families and kids who are dealing with it and then my my personal life and professional a has a totally coincides a\nCone totally coincided in ... in your story is what\nA similar to uh to our other guest some you know had children that um\nYou know we're we're we're we're doing fine and then you just notice boy this sudden this sudden change him and uh you know you you try to figure out what's going on you know for my son it it uh you know almost overnight he started to um\n[noise] he starts to to have a you know anxiety he's got ticks and he's he's um you know really kind of regret singing\nThrowing a a you know temper tantrums doesn't want to go to school and this is a lovable kid that you know months before it ... you know\nHe never saw this in so you know that's the scary part is kind of feel like on some level you lose your your child do you know that that that kid that you know I'm kind of disappears and so um\nYou know that's why we're we're doing our best to get the word out about this um I I Believe it was some uh Lisa who said she didn't know about it and that's what that's what we hear all the time that's our story too right we had a pediatrician that that\nWasn't really aware of it and it took some of our own digging to find out what it was ... and then try to confirm it or after the fact but that's why\nGetting the word out about it getting more research done this so important what we're trying to do\nYou know I'm not a doctor and I don't play one on TV or the radio but\nAll of the parents seem that we've talked to in this group and I should say the my interest in this or we have a granddaughter that is I'm involved in this circumstance I'm so we've researched it a little bit more than a normal gas too I Would be but it appears as though when we've talked to other parents\nUm the term misdiagnose born undiagnosed seems to always come up in the conversation we used to let's go back to you will will go Lisa Melissa ... probably the easiest way to do with a Lisa tell us did you have a scenario where a doctors were giving you I'm\nEither no information or wrong information\nAbsolutely they put a ... year old daughter on it though is is that if a psychotic I won't say let's say a her personality for and I are feeling from happy go lucky little kids you know I Would say you have a trend\nI'm obsessive compulsive currently only it was not only on cars positive thoughts but it was also accent she was like driven by like a motor\nThat went on for about four months and um there was nothing then that was in two thousand five five so it was nothing on the Internet I was looking at case studies because one doctor says something about it we like that but I don't think it's sad and then go without\nUm she was the one that actually finally diagnosed her or her off that it was about it\nAnd on the foliage and got her partially that ... and then his ... you know a lot of lapses over the years she's twenty now so I'm In there is hoping to follow that people love it there is hope but\nHad a lot of problems that I also had um like a problem that alone yeah mine are now ... says so then you know a lot of other\nHousing thing you know in our in our health history that iPhone contributed to their problem than does\nContributed to it or as a result of it\nCould be one or the other I not actually sure if I'm because we really don't have anyone that at that time was diagnosed thing and I was lucky that\nWe ended up I ended up on you know little group of people and we all got together and decided on\nThe New England pen than to associates and so it was started by a group of parents and a medical professional volunteer habitat and then on to raise awareness and we started raising awareness\nUm educating the community and ... says now this is what are we educate effort in the school system because of that for us that the that\nUm we do conferences conference advocates outfits and bringing the effort across the country to come in and at the other people were really trying to get the word out there so that personally you know I've had to get the ... I don't want to see anyone else go through whatever ...\nAnd Melissa I think you mentioned you kind of your story already as far as I'm you're working in the field and then became personally involved in the field\nCorrect and so yeah I Want my son was diagnosed and actually um because of the work I did I\nAnd you know the rich are tied to quickly I was able to figure it out and that God my pediatrician with on board and um she was actually on the board of the agency that I was working at the time but I think the you know I wasn't a\nLack of heck I think a lot of parents are seen a pilot that they had ... than ... syndrome or something like that because parents are often saying in\nA in a doctor's office and who it and you know in my line of work I see kids now who\nYou know heartbreaking may go years and years but the fact that uh the amount of fake mad that they are put on our you know get the different treatments that are given that are effective um really hinders their their progress and it's it's really sad to see but\nUm but I you know I was I was really lucky that I was able to catch it early and not that it made it\nBetter because my kids now now I'll read it and I could have it um\nYou know they certainly have had their challenges and struggles and continue but um you know I I'm thankful that I wasn't a you know I did figure it out early and you know then was able to advocate for my kind of quickly and start on the appropriate ...\nJeff would you just go you know we talk briefly before we came on the air uh heredity or environment or both [noise] well I you know for what the research shows or whatever now and it's still it's kind of work in progress\nUh getting this research done but um you know our family or auto immune runs in the family auto immune issues this was an auto immune disease which is basically the bodies are immune system\nUm reacts in the wrong way when it encounters the strip and so uh in in unfortunately because it's getting into the nurses is getting into the brain\nThat's causing a lot that causes emotional response is the um over you know emotional triggers the or the meltdowns if you will to the anxiety issues the ticks and all those things\nAnd you know we we we were lucky enough that my wife um you know she's a teacher and and she she knows kind of what what ordinary anxiety should look like at different ages and she's an elementary school teacher and she's also a fighter and\nUm so we had a you know I I think to be fair to doctors and pediatricians you know they do probably get with the age of the Internet also comes a lot of information not all older most correct relevance correct so they probably have a lot of parents oh you know I was reading this explains what my kid is going through and it's probably one of the million right now than it's probably not\nBut you know when you go you want to be heard and you want it to be treated you know seriously and we weren't getting that from our pediatrician and my wife again she's a fighter and she she wasn't going to take no for an answer so you know she found a pediatrician that was willing to listen I'm you know thankfully he was\nUm in a circle of you know in an orbit where we she kind of was able to get in touch with him and\nTook us took us on and he was um just willing to to do the\nDo the research on it decided to to ah to engage upon a fairly conservative treatment of antibiotics are well first step to testing and not just a rapid trapped test but an actual strep test my son\nI'm a I'm sure he's going to love to hear this audio when he grows up but ah he had a rash on his bum that wasn't kind of you know kind of going away and and so you know we actually it was actually you know ... uh rectal strip so you know it's not it's strep doesn't always has a sore throat it can hide anywhere in the body can hide so\n[noise] so we're going to take a break right to recover no good to regret now I'm ladies stay with us when we come back or I Want you to um\nWas joining us who's had this disorder for several years and we'll be back with more on pins and pin this on the door and let me show and I want to say thank you to um\nTo Lisa in Melissa for joining us this segment and ladies keep listening\nOr [noise]\nThis is Jordan let me show when they tell him I have to she was ... when you're telling the truth stories always is just one use radio five eighty and Ninety four boy died after a W E a G [noise]\n\nSuzie October night what's new today on the free I heart radio a radio\nIs perfect for decorating the house or just setting the theory move our spicy platelet has your tracks with labor inspired when no after day\nIn swing mixture you break out all our great deal the party playlists whether you're at home or let's say the um the new I our Radio Free ... collections that come out now\nEveryone knew where our city's best chance to pick up their heart designing greedy hands for signature drinks dishes and desert Miriam here from ...
