judicial court if I criticize a an action that he's taken or voted he's taken a statement that he's made\nHow does that threaten the independence of the judiciary rule ... they're not supposed to cheer when I say they're not\nSupposed to care what politicians say that's Moshe beyond reproach they're not supposed to be powerful\n\nNow need a judge cited in the Pacific examples McGahn saluted to a recent attempt by some Republican lawmakers to remove a judge from his position for decision they disagreed with\nWell that's my right that's my right and it's the legislators right to impeach a judge if they've done something wrong it's a connoisseurs right to impeach a federal judge if they've done something wrong\nThey impeach him and have a trial just like they do for the president is that right whether we agree disagree with it that's the right no one should not have checks and balances on them\nAnd certainly the judiciary I'm not in favor of I'm asking judge it was I don't want some politics involved in running ads for judge\n\nAnd the danger of conflicts of interest in going out to raise money\n\nBut I certainly don't seem to beyond reproach\n\nWhen some of the decisions that they've made even recently you have cost the death of people\n\nWe've talked into show about murderers they killed police officers\nThat easy sentences imposed by judges sorority times arrested twenty times interested twenty nine times arrest\n\nSo we shouldn't be able to say something that there's something wrong with these judges\nThat have rules is why we shouldn't say that that person shows contempt for\nSociety by not putting out personal way and not letting him to be a threat to society so no the widow doesn't have to cry at the tomb of their husband was a casket his moment\n\nJudges sometimes make mistakes as they did or not we would not need a public porch and even when judges ask properly within the bounds of the law is inevitable that a difficult case some people would disagree with that decision is fair game and criticize the judge's decision yet says she'll what is he complaining\nAbout if it's fair game which I Believe it is what's the problem\nBuddy and it was threatening judges was removing solely because of a mistake or not unpopular decisions threatens independence is judicious well let me say this to Ralph yes\nIf you did your job if a Supreme judicial court did their job\nAnd reprimanded or took affirmative action against judges who are not doing their job correctly\nHave made mistakes and a number of them\nAnd have an either removed retrain these judges and you want to look in the mirror\n\nHe says his friends are constitutional obligation to apply the more recently you're supposed to be above all that you're not supposed to read the headlines\nYou're supposed to be somebody that small that that's why you have a job to seven but that doesn't mean you have top notch\n\nI mean there's nobody in this country has always has doesn't have to ask somebody was it was the answer to the voters or what you ask me to the legislature issued to somebody\n\nYou know if he can't take the heat maybe you got the wrong people there\n\nIn the last year a few Republican members of the Massachusetts house of Saud to advance a bill of address seeking rule would judge Tennessee feely\nWho came under fire over controversial rulings excluding sentencing manual soda a teeny two probation or set a prison time after he pled guilty to drug dealing charge wow she just someone that was a drug dealer\n\nAnd was given probation and I think that there's something wrong with the judge\n\nOr the judge's discretion\nThis guy was fine with more than a half a pound to heroin in a secret ...\n\nSort of ... he was an illegal alien\n\nNot spent an American citizen he would have been sense but if you were sentence in a felony you would have been deported so judge Timothy Seeley Georgia Tennessee fairly decided not to do that\n\nReality another case governor Charlie Baker finished eating August from WBAI co hosts her mouth has been a hand during a Thomas on over ... district court judge will ... lives should bail for

they should have a job she answers if they find that the corps judicial consciousness\nI just bad judges or if it's just a bad Josh is on the governor's council to the gym was this cheerful and the son of people that I voted for it but what is the person has to be a bad judge\n\nAnd it's the first Supreme judicial court isn't doing this job in monitoring structures\n\nShe'll talk to a gym case you remember the governor's ... hey Jordan or you\nGot I already talking about all these stories and I just\nWanted to call in and say you know I agree with you and I've been working with I'm a
