[noise]\nHey Jordan thanks for having me on really difficult time for our community and by community I mean not only the Jewish people of central math but a nationwide and worldwide there is even outpouring of support from a Jewish communities in Europe and then of course in Israel\nPrime minister Netanyahu gave a remarks on the tragedy to a hard time for us and a\nLot of a lot of sad faces today and\nEthical thing to see you know you're Jewish ... how do you put this thing a perspective us I mean I've been around a long time and I have never been\nShown on only disgusted and depressed as I was yesterday or Sally\n[noise] well [noise] or I\nShould point out that a tragedy is nothing new to the Jewish people but each time we experienced it the pain of it is raw and real and hurtful and uh this is unfortunately that then the next incident in a long long long line of\nTragedy um maybe we're too familiar with it but\nIt's not just us it hurts us and um I think it's particularly horrific that it happened that had happened in a synagogue during a baby naming and that in itself just recognizing that a baby naming is about the celebration of life\nAnd that ended up\nEnded up at the end of the day with a ... eleven people murdered I don't think it gets much worse than that\nNo and you know we can say is a work of a crazed I'm\nA one praised a man one no one hater but\nJust the one hater or\nThe amount of people were killed\nWhatsoever haters all over the place this is not a new thing for us\nAnd that's the pasta that has the\nTo the point of being totally or just disgusted with\nUh I listen to the speeches I listen to people speaking I listen to the politicians and um what is their answer\nBetter understanding better education better what\nWhat are we going to stop running out at night but\nI'm not a psychologist and a and anti Semitism is about the most ancient of all forms of hundred right so what are we going to stop what was so new about tonight\nOn law I'm at a loss for an answer with that all I can tell you I grew up in a community of Holocaust survivors and the rabbi my synagogue growing up survived Auschwitz oh it's all family were slaughtered and that and the gas chambers of Auschwitz and he said you know the world\nThe world doesn't realize that Jews top the world to be humane that's at the ten commandments are all about that's the foundation of of who we are the people evil looks at that and wants to strike at it evil is the opposite of humane this and you stand for humane this so\nWe're the target and um the difference today between between today and and the last two thousand years that we face if they're more\nIs that we've got Israel we have a we have a homeland we have a we had a land where we can carry the uh the banner with the Israeli with the Jewish star on it uh freely and proudly\nUm that's not to say that the United states is a fantastic place to live for Jews but\nWe live with these incidents this this isn't this happens it happens to us we have to take all the precautions we can we have to make sure that our synagogues are protected are Jacey fees are protected anywhere where they're Jewish people are protected we've got to be vigilant\nAnd um and we've got to be certain that were secure that that's really the answer yes coming together as a community something we've got to do we've got to be United by at the end of the day we've gotta protect ourselves\nNow that's kind of sad tribute but you do and I know like the the the uh the president or a and others are made that statement or being rounded we uh\nAre criticizing it's not about politics I don't care whether is Trump or anybody else or be roundly criticized but quite honestly uh we do have to protect ourselves because nobody's going to protect us or if we don't protect ourselves that's it are just very very simple\nThe president's going to Pittsburgh on Tuesday it's just a just was announced by NBC News or he should be there but I'm all the speeches in the world Steve I mean you know you're in the trenches every day of digging around trying to keep up Jewish mice alive in the city or in a in this area um\nWe've got a governor Arnold baths is no one's going to have it for us\nRight you can't be naive about it it's great to live in the United states are free here we're pretty safe here are but there are still haters out there and there are people who are who will try to attack us and we'll try to exploit the freedom and and uh and openness that we have so\nI'm not saying we've gotta we've gotta walk ourselves down and be a suspicious of everyone and ah but I'm saying there's no reason that you can't live\nA great way and also be said\nHas learned to do that Israel is learned to balance it and maybe that's something that we can learn from them\nSee ... director of the Jewish and Russian thank you very much in a state will\nThanks Jordan\nAll right um\n\nI go back to the uh the point of what's changed\n\nI mean I was pretty well you know focused in Saturday Saturday Night Sunday\n\nJust hot and\nHer\n\nBut at the end of it all what's changed\n\nIt has much to know what's changed and I want to know\nComments and by the ... the way they behave\n\nThat day in effect themselves\n\nLook down their noses at the Jewish people\nWe are not alone in suffering we have just been suffering

William ... we we allow immigration are legally into this country every year well over a million people well so what's our obligation which just tell me when I when I guess they got ... five thousand or fourteen thousand people from another country because things are bad there\nI I don't know if we can set up um humane him of addressing their shelter food when they reach ... I don't know what\nThe role of the rich Taiwan or they come off but if they reach the border and ... but then they have to be arrested because they go to ... there's going to surrender and then they've got to be released so is catching really ass and they're going to be deported but they'll never be deployed because they're gonna they're gonna get into the dark shadows of this country and we've already got twenty two million and you're right you\nKnow what you're holding an act but many of our employees on earth are having undocumented okay if it's like where I didn't play written by at one point at which point do you as a taxpayer I Want to pay for them [noise]\nI don't know I don't have the resolution okay if we go if you if you must not any very and that's not what they're doing if we can need to address the five legality for the for the for wages by military personnel by any means and there's no wall that you can can hang\nOn just a wall entertain some of it not all of a well rounded laws were up to your sassy Israel ... they can China ... well you know this is a is a worst in Israel so um I don't know but uh an open borders certainly doesn't work\nOkay Thanks Joe we appreciate it will be back\nIs this is news radio five eighty ...\nUh expeditiously on designing those buildings um [noise] I think he's he's hopefully going to have an announcement soon our flags for the hotels are and some of the retailers are that are interested so we should have some news on that and I'm not too distant future\nNow is that going to be up in concert with the stadium I mean as you could look like or is she finally found a that's a great point hanging out there on his own\nYeah no that's one thing we talked about so what we want to do is have the once we picked the design team the architect firm for the ballpark\nTo sit down with the folks who are doing the design and architectural worked for the developer for all his buildings as well as ... tea and the POW so deep you W is going to do some of the streets and sidewalks with mass works money as well as the garage\nAnd then mass DOT is doing Kelly square and some other infrastructure so we want the four parties to sit down and\nTalk about what the design elements looked like including the landscaping we want this to look like at all belong together like it's fluid and complementary and a lot of that I think can be accomplished with landscaping and we're going to take a real\nHard look at landscaping [noise] you know\nWe talk about green island but if you go from Compton park to downtown it's not a lot of green and green I there's no great idea and why this project and give us the opportunity to reintroduce green to green island this and really try to use it as a way to connect\nSo whether it be you know rain garden small pocket parks other amenities that kinda weave the whole site together as well as making sure the buildings are similar architectural styles and kinda complements each other so that that's the exciting part you get the kind of a great something from\nScratch yeah [laughter] well ... that's what is it wise important to say that you know the ballpark as you said you're going to be very unique smoking it's not going to be a stamp of something else and whatever you end up with it you know I'm\nLike as you said or maybe the diner concept on the outside whatever is but that the a private developer not just look like\nIt you know kind of grew out of a mushroom yeah it doesn't belong like it's from some other kind of error or somebody that you know and it just doesn't fit so I mean although that's you know his money and his investment but sounds like he's really really role when to go and he's\nVery uh he's very good to work with these very cooperative or he gets that all of these pieces complement each other and if\nThey're stronger together the stronger if they fit together and work together um and you know I Would tease folks that you know I think we've got some other exciting components to this to announce in the not too distant future so I think things are coming together even better than we had thought right\nUh and so more to come right okay much talk about the flu\nYeah so the flu or one of the baseball to the flu or find it's out there it's out there and you know this is the time of year that folks should be getting the flu shots and um\nWe took us extra special effort to try to engage the school community um\nLast year we got about eleven hundred kids through um our efforts with school nurses and other public health department to get a flu vaccines this year we've we're up to twenty seven hundred kids who signed up for creating the little incentive program\nAnd it's important for a bunch of reasons or you know last year Seventy nine thousand people died this low a thousands more hospitalized and um you know severely impacted by the flu\nBut a lot of people end up losing time in school or kids who need to be in school every day they possibly can\nAnd if we could shrink the number of kids who are out of school because they get the flu or or if they get the flu they don't get as bad as they otherwise would of and they can have more in school time um that's good for their um academic performance for their I'm kind of staying up what this study's\nAnd the other issues we get a lot of kids in the city who live in multigenerational families um [noise]\nThere's grandpa grandma or a living at home with the family a and they may be old and they may have some health issues and compromise or immune systems and so\nThe average person Russ flu passes it on six other people\nAnd so if you've got kids who are interacting with kids and bringing that home or it can have really you know devastating a and potentially fatal impacts on family members finish almost laboratories for this I mean hey yeah that's where you get you know\nThe kids are school age kids ah you know it's tough to get them to take the advice of washing their hands on your mouth and nose out all of the rest and\nUm so we can reduce the number of kids who get the flu or or get the severity of the flow um it's good for a public health outcomes and it's good for the academic for now are they getting flu shots in the schools yeah so we've partnered with the mass the ph and with wild greens so\nI'm the permission slips went home to their parents if the parents sign the kids up not a lot of kids maybe\nThrough the pediatrician visits get them or other means of parents take care of that that's great\nUm but for the kids who didn't do it that way will have an option right in school school nurse will give them um they have the signed permission slip they'll give them the vaccine or and they're good to go takes about two weeks for the antibodies to build up\nAnd then you have the ah immunity for you know the most prevalent strain for the flu\nSeason I've already gotten my mug shots so I I go to the earlier than usual but I happen to be getting up I was Aaron Rodgers might as well get it\nIt's it's I got to get it every year every year to um you know I got the flu and I took the shot well that's that's that's not true I mean sometimes maybe this coincidences are already have a ... or whatever but um\nI mean the anybody's six months and above um who doesn't want to get the flu she get the flu shot and now it's particularly recommended for older people or people with health issues um\nBut certainly anybody just doesn't want to be sick um should get the flu shot it's usually covered in your insurance so it doesn't caution is a downside um\nAnd anybody who wants you know you certainly can get 'em at any of the pharmacies they've all got flu clinics these days\nBut at our public health department or in the nurse's office every Tuesday from two to four are down to twenty five ... street folks and go there I just show up but get your flu shot um which is another way to to access that if you don't have a primary care physician or a you don't want to go to the pharmacy you can\nGo now you're going to do anything of a ... like at the senior center or anything like that we've\nWe've done that are already a couple of fact I went up to the senior center and I got my flu shot or seen yeah [laughter] I'm getting up it was a I get to one of the job as old as a [laughter]\nA we've done them at city hall different number of places a lot of work places also walk from as part of their you know health insurance program [noise]\nUm but the actual the number of people who got the flu vaccine last year dropped about six percent um nationally so it's something we need to keep just reminding people the importance of doing and um\nYou know make it as easy as possible and particularly our school ledge population because it's such a\nSuch a ripe population they're interacting they're in close proximity with each other and you know it has such consequences for their education\nAnd you know just to prove it's a proven science that are that it's\nI'm just if you want to make sure that your congregation or your workplace or your civic organizations or your school or whatever it may be a knows what the latest uh advice and strategy is if if God Forbid they find themselves some issues of is there really is it's a sad commentary on the world um\nBut you know I think\nOne thing that people should know was certainly in Worcester I think there's many communities around the country uh one community when anybody gets attacked in our community or threatened in our community it's an attack or a threat against all of us are and so we won't tolerate it no matter the race religion\nOr ethnic background sexual orientation that doesn't met anybody who is threatened or attack were all threatened or attacked and we will do everything that we can to rally around both from public resources as well as just raising our voices and showing our our commitment to everybody in our community\nOkay uh what do we take a break right now Matt and when we come back we'll pick it up when the city manager a little bit more on this subject and then we'll go often talk about some other things ...

went back you know in the city manager of the study what's your ... and we always appreciate him coming up so so uh so\nDo the police department is already into related with the leadership within the Jewish community and uh and uh as you said there are there are connections there are there people see something is also responsible in his citizenship or something um you know you got to make a call in or\nI mean there's just there's just not in a in a\nPittsburgh ... he didn't live in a vacuum\nYou know people have to hear what he was saying and read what he was saying\nAnd even the guy down in Florida with the with the bomb with the bombs and the crazy van and all of this I mean so that's yeah that's that's the thing I mean you people need to kind of communicate that and even if\nEven if people can't take immediate action sometimes they can keep an eye on something that seems suspicious or you know weird behavior you're unusual things and it's good to have that record there and give the police department that heads up and [noise]\nYou know certainly is people see stuff on on social media or or other kinds of online chat rooms or things that\nYou know suggest that somebody might have some violent intentions are making some kind of threats are alluding to something that might be physical violence\nUm don't keep it a secret don't think you're bothering the police department and don't think it's a oh it's probably nothing communicated it's better to err on the side of caution than to ignore it and then find out something was a serious and and they were horrible consequences\nBecause there's no don't operate in value I mean they don't I mean the uniform with it but that was different I mean but if you look at\nAnd I'm no expert on this but I mean we could any of that stuff I mean these people talk they're always chattering because they want to brag to brag a dose you know they're they're out there and we got me I'm really tough and I'm going to do this number to do the bombs and and the guy's driving around you I mean it's like a billboard his truck which a billboard nobody sorry no friends of his art which they did yeah\nNo one no one thought enough to call and they started this guy's a crockpot he's about ready to blow\nSame as the guy in Pittsburgh\nI mean if he was that much of an anti Semite he didn't suddenly wake up that day I mean he was talking about this and talking about what he was going to do before he did\nSomebody had said known some thing overheard something or saw some crazy behavior\nAnd writings yeah you know and like you can't expect with all these Web sites out there I mean I Know the little but I Do you can't expect are you going to be able to the police of FBI or the federal can sit and read every one of these Web sites in the posting is thousands and thousands\nIt's hard to do that and that's you know just like anything else they rely on good citizens or to give them a heads up to be on the side of the good guys if you will and\nBe the eyes and ears of the community out there because you're probably going to see something or here's something before the police were authority here it and um you know it's our obligation to keep each other safe or by sharing that and and giving that information to the proper authorities so they can follow up on and luckily\nYou know we gotta amazing police departments and I'm really dedicated men and women and the prime and they've got a lot of good sophisticated technology they also have good relationships with\nUm we have a was to police officer who's imbedded with the state police we have one and better to put the da ... with the FBI so that is good\nCommunication and coordination with those different agencies so what is the right authority as to kind of bring into something or to share information we've got those kind of channels opened up um\nThat I think make us all safe for a million boy yeah really exchange this this is a pretty complicated business\nIt isn't it a lot of dogs to be connected and there's a lot of things to be tracked down in them you know the bigger network of law enforcement and intelligence gathering the better uh and again we're in this together this is our community and we got to keep it safe\nAll right uh let's talk about the NPR story yeah there was a great uh Aaron Schachter who did a um a piece for the national NPR all over the country are and the headline\nWas a move over Oakland in Hoboken West is the new at city uh and did a great job talking about uh\nYou know how a lot of cities in the country that are bigger cities have become so successful\nUh and so expensive that sometimes the next closest city has kind of taken off as people look for you know more affordable options butts in that same urban environment\nAnd certainly that's the case with Oakland close to San Francisco and Hoboken close to New York city um and the kind of theme of this story was Worcester in proximity to
