never have to use the military or if you look around you'll see it as\nWell yeah there are some signs there are some signs that a\nBig one and and the war of Eighteen twelve for some history when the British what trying to take global Washington just that they were about to take out the outskirts of Washington a large storm came along and preventing them from doing so\nWell that was a large storm that came along with the red sea children separated\nBut God has something to do with that I just actually and and the Jews were able to get through because the Egyptians were chasing them and then the recipe and open up and let them all runway in the Bible ... and then she closed and all those people were gone\nSo we're going to win I don't know what powers Trump passed bill but man maybe I don't know I don't want to open up the red sea again\nNo no no I'm actually saw at not it's not Trump the hand of God and you don't want to buy money that you'll say\nI Will never argue with any a man

are\nMy on my own\nBank [laughter] I just wanted to say that I agree with everything that you say and as a like I said a former Marine I just I I'm a kind of lost for words of how people can be have the other viewpoint of how\nIt's okay to let these people and and for the examples you just made of once they put their foot and then why don't we change that law or once they got their foot in the you know my opinion you you've done nothing to deserve anything from\nThe ... you know ... minutes while you're while you I don't know why you end up with the due process to process should be for a for people that are legally here that I I don't know how you can do something illegal and then be protected by the same cause of same government\nThat protects innocent people are protects people that I'm a breaking the law knowingly breaking the law they know that breaking all by coming into this country illegally\nSo that's exactly what my point is that um I don't question why it I mean Ninety ... well I shouldn't say what the numbers but most people would agree with that we need to change that\nCongress in ... Congress has to grow some backbone and are they going to do this and they got to do it right away because it's not about not being receptive country we have to have immigration we have a zero population growth\nIn this country so we need immigrants to come here but we need immigrants to come in that event it now want to come here to want to learn the language that want to go to work they want us to raise their families and I encourage them to Columbia but come here legally\nMigrant Parrish did your grandparents or great grandparents did ...

Want to talk about of as we get up to the top of the hour and a city manager joined just\nCan you imagine and I can't Trump pass rallies Donald Trump the president has rallies\nAnd he attracts thousands and thousands of people at a rally\nNow the challenge of going to go on after the midterm elections they're going to go on a\nSpeaking champagne healing built and they're going to charge now people stayed in line at the Toyota Center in Houston\nFor twenty four hours to get a ticket to go in and hear Donald Trump at a rally I mean that's absolutely unbelievable you know I've been I've been fooling around with politics all my life\nAnd I mean\nI mean you have to be like the pope before I'd stand in line for twenty four hours to see anybody I'm standing in line for twenty four hours to see when it passed with you on right now they've probably which they don't want it but but I'm standing in line to see depression United States were\nTwenty four hours I just wouldn't I mean I respect them or not this president really pressure twenty four hours\n... if you were paid to stand in line for twenty four hours to get in\nYou couldn't pay me enough I mean\nThis then you think some of those people are paid no to be in there that are causing ... they didn't ... though\nThey were all of their supporting Trump and they had to move to a larger venue and um when I see the president speak Monday Night and supportive Ted Cruz reelection bid\nBegan taking shape more than twenty four hours before the rally was in twenty four hours before the rally was set to begin\nLisa brule was the first us take her place in the corner across in post read\nAcross from an Eighteen thousand seats arena at ten am on a Sunday Morning by nightfall Houston police were preparing to rearrange more than a hundred and Seventy five people who joined brule with chess intense\nJust see the president Eighteen thousand people went to a rally now this is what Trump did last\nTime it everyone ignored that these huge rallies Eighteen thousand twenty five thousand thirty sauce and the polish came out\nHe can't he can't win he's going to win so Hillary Clinton's gonna wash the floor with him she's getting two hundred people at a rally he's got an Eighteen thousand people at a rally and then the pollsters call you up and say who you're voting\nFor everybody not to them because you don't want to tell people you voted for Trump you run out of your neighborhood I mean there are people who say that they go into counseling husbands and wives over Donald Trump\nWife mostly with the husband ... with a wife that go into psychiatrists and psychologists\nOver Trump friend John friends anymore over Donald Trump show but standing in line for twenty four hours to hear that guy ... and the people are rabbits\nNow are those people show up two weeks from today a choice from tomorrow I mean it is it that deep if they show up if that's true to be\nThen you take all these ... there's no doubt decided forty years ago two years ago\nThat for the first time in the history of Gallup they would not do a poll on the presidential election first time ever an Air National pollsters they said this is not an election you can call Donald Trump is a Trump caught your call the election so we'll see how you got those\nAnd we're going to check ourselves out for his ear will join when we come back the manager's going to George would end up on\nYou ain't gonna rock 'n' roll no\nDon't do that is that Jordan let me show what Russia did is move into Syria and then went on a wink and a lot of women was hand Putin invited Iran on\nYouth Radio five eighty ... boy died after Abu doubled UTA Jean [noise]\nEach one has a tree plant that for them or\nWas done right after the war um and the memorial arch a that many people remember a that was in disrepair but that's all being restored inaccessible walking past so ... somebody in a wheelchair or walk or a can get to memorial grove\nIn a new component um which was designed by a WPRI professor and the forging stunned by students who were stir technical high school there's going to be a a sphere [noise]\nUm [noise] that's going to be a new kind of uh\nBefore the trees at a green hill park in the name of each person who was lost in World War one and the dates or will be on that we'll dedicate all of that are on a veterans' day this year that they're ... to look forward to going off to see it yeah it's right near the the uh [noise]\nI'm a Vietnam Veterans Memorial which that's been refurbished in the last couple of years to help with the state I got a severe form which was just going just so out of the park is a great recreational a opportunity but it's also a great place of remembrance and honor for our veterans of some different uh\nUm theaters of action was that it's\nReally a positive thing a city I'm a ... which certainly um has a\nA memorialized continue to memorialize and take care of\n'em these monuments they fell in disrepair um raised on the comment I Know you wait in squares and other ones you know talked about the world while we talked about the world war\nOne memorial last week or ... or the front of the boys club so I mean I think I think this is not always an obligation I think it was with a good community is all about\nIt I think it reflects what the sentiments of the citizens and taxpayers are I Know they honor our veterans they appreciate the service no matter how long ago\nWe did the civil war memorial in common we re dedicated added the fountain to the world war two memorial we were able to have a lot of World War two veterans and even from that dedication just three years ago we've lost a lot of those guys\nI'm now World War one I'm no matter how long ago it is there's no statute of limitations for us to remember even though there's not a World War one veteran alive\nOr a spouse or or many cases even a child um will still remember it will still honor them on the surface\nWho's the rich who [noise] All right I'm not\nSure where would you like me to start to identify it as an illustration\nOf first of all of you only the city of Worcester or are you still are city which they're still doing some town\n... only the city of western justice videos of him so every it it's it's a little I Know that you know Spanish he yeah he was so I can only assist residents of West are okay now if someone calls the office I'm not gonna you know have them leave empty handed I'm going to point them in the right direction\nMake sure they're set up for success tell them who they're BSO is in their town I'm not just gonna you know hey Eliza phone we're going to make sure that they have a townhouse you had to be a veteran at Lafayette yeah so that was written in laws are some time after the civil war but this has been going on since the French in Indian War\nAnd the la soul did even says something to the effect of no veteran Shelby popularized so I'm\nNow okay so tell us what the benefits of what what are people now can you do awful\nSo there's a number of different things I think what confuses most people is there is a state in cities side to to what most of what my office does for benefits but then there's also a federal component to benefits\nSo the federal component is what everybody knows is the department of veteran affairs\nOr they get a lot of attention to news if they ever have any health care issues but\nAh they've done a number of overhauling and credentialing and the level of services drastically improved\nBut beyond health care you have education benefits and then in some instances you have a very old benefits depending on\nYour length of service in nature of service and then you also have um a home loan benefit you can have the federal government backs the purchase of your home saves you money both in interest and a ... as well\nI'm moving to the state side um there's a number of different benefits under chapter one Fifteen of Massachusetts General law\nYou have a number of annuities are bonuses so a welcome home bonuses for World War two Vietnam um and uh a Persian Gulf and then also post nine eleven service\nYou have a new a tease for uh people who maybe um say a hundred percent disabled maybe lost a limb or both limbs or maybe they lost their hearing her eyesight and then also the annuity is extended to gold star families so parents of that deceased service member but then also the spouse\nUm or you know dependent children depending on on their age\nIn terms of uh the other benefits I think is probably the most popular benefit is what they call you know colloquially a chapter one Fifteen benefits it's a\nCan range from reimbursement for medical expenses to a regular monthly financial assistance so there are some income an asset limits um depending on where you are I you know I have a number of veterans are eligible dependents that are permanently disabled\nAnd so you know maybe they have a little bit of income from Social Security or retirement but they're not able to make ends meet we can provide them with regular assistance for things like rent heat and you know if eligible um medical so copayments for doctors visits dental\nUm you know ambulances hospitals as we can really\nAssist them with a broad realm of issues or the other end of that is your veterans' services officer is sort of a a one stop shop so to speak so we can help you with housing if you're trying to apply for subsidized housing or whether that's the you know a federal subsidy or state subsidy\nOr we also help people make sure they have the right\nHealth insurance so maybe they're beyond in income limit where they don't have\nA mass health we want to make sure they have a good affordable Medicare supplement plan um or prescription drug coverage\nWe look at a number of different things to make sure our clients are set up for the best possible financial situation because to be quite honest with you eighty percent of the people at least that come to my office or you know facing some difficult circumstances I'm I think the\nBiggest population of people I have the largest impact on um my team and I definitely is are unemployed or underemployed veterans [noise]\nUm I have a program that's kind of structure that ties in with a veteran zinc they administer a number of grants from the federal or state government for employment and training and then also a formerly worked for central which is now mass hire 'em and then with my office and so there's a structure to it we meet monthly\nWe talk about you know what's working what's not working I periodically meet with each unemployed veteran look at their resume\nI'm eyes the I'll even sit like if they have zero luck getting calls for interviews I showed them how to apply for a job what language they should be using how to translate military experience into um you know ... or more civilian understandable occupation\nUm because you know if you're an infantry men there's really there's no in for treatment in in the in the real world so how do we translate that so what we look at is um\nYou know management qualifications if you're a squad leader you've managed four or five soldiers how do you translate that\nIf you had a number of vehicles and weapons and you are responsible for the maintenance using those automated systems to get your military equipment maintained get it through the the shops logging miles there's there's a number of\nUh you know second third order effects for military duty that translate to a number of civilian jobs and I think a lot of people struggle 'em and sending that message so\nHold on to break your back with our of the service officers and the city manager was more about what the veterans service officers does and uh the upcoming veterans' day celebration here was sort of wish for right back [noise]\nThis is Jordan and let me show and I'm looking at a press today they know every single thing that's going on there on top of Trump like a wet blanket on use radio five eighty and Ninety four boy died after after double duty AG\nThe\nFate of my friends that you wouldn't be here on the

or on the ... coming up\nThank you for having me it's always an honor to be here managers one you off the hook you get home early next\nAct a law that that's the problem [laughter] I live and I do All right Mr manager\nSo what of\nWhen we talk about what's going on\nI sent you might have heard there's an election coming up yeah room or Rome as an election coming up and today was the first day of early voting um\nWe launch this two years ago uh with the presidential race and very successfully a we're close to sixteen thousand people take advantage of early voting during the presidential race I'm so\nEarly voting is going on from now until a friday November second before election day and the cost will be open from a seven AM till eight pm on election day so really there are no excuses not to vote or\nIf somebody's in the hospital or otherwise and from their eligible to cast an absentee ballot um but if you want to do it in person\nOr from eight forty five AM to seven pm today at the universe Terry and universal is church and then it'll move locations will be at the senior center tomorrow or there was the public library straws on staff at St big why on\nUm may street and then back ah repeating that same cycle next week we also have a Saturday and Sunday hours are which are a little different those tend to six\nUm but regardless of your work schedule your school schedule you should be able to find some time to vote\nOr if you're worried about crowds lines on election day maybe you have a tight window of time\nVoter early get it done if you're worried about the weather will have some good days between now and election day get your vote in a you'll have done your duty or and you won't have to worry about election\nWhat happens to the ballots I mean I vote today I did yeah but I ... where what happens to those dollars so all the ballots that are not be my precinct right so because we have\nThese polling pads anybody from any location across the city can go to one of these polling places they can find you on the list no matter what water precinct that ah is home for you or they'll knock you off you will be marked off in that central voting system so election day you won't be able to vote again 'cause they'll see joined the levee already voted\nUh and then that ballot has put in the envelope and it saved\nAnd that election day it goes out to your appropriate water precinct ballots counted with the other votes from that particular water piece of this kind of re distributed to the right spot\nJust like an absentee ballot and so if you a sense an absentee ballot in ultimately the day of election those are distributed to the appropriate wouldn't precinct\nUh and then added to the ... so I'm you know that water precincts collies are all together in one location\n... the law and the and the people that are assigned to that voting area would open up the animal\nWould open them into the machine and then there'd be part of the tally for that particular location but again the you're already checked off is as a voting for your ... your\nChecked off than a you'd only be able to vote once your name will be a in the system we bought I pads for all of the the the location so that they have kind of electronic access a lot of times when you go into the\nActual election day you'll see that people were still the books that they go through I looking for the street address and then your number and then your name and stuff and they check you off there at the early voting locations though I have an electronic version of that so they can immediately mark you off in the in the system\nSo still today was um um one one day one day one yeah and that was that the universe was church yup show tomorrow they go where\nTomorrow and go to senior center okay eight forty five AM until seven PM so good long a number of hours Wednesday will be the what's the public library downtown\nOr Thursday um will be at the shah was on staff at St
