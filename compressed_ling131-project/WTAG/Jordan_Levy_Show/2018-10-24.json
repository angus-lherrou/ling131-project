I don't really care thrown away just last year postage stamp on me our phone call I don't care if I get\nAll sorts of harassing phone calls all the time when people trying to get into just one you have that\nOh no yeah I like\nHis missed the you know we die out here already more\n\nThan it is another question do you think independent voters get the respect we deserve from the media political parties and candidates\nEighty eight percent said no\nThey take for granted now where you have to go somewhere\nOh no vote\nPosters frequently asked independence whether they lean more towards the Democratic party Republican body I think this reflects a biased as designed to dissuade you from being independent absolutely\nIt does and overall in this poll it absolutely does\n\nDo you think your question places a higher value will be a Democrat or Republican I'm being independent\nYeah I think that the questions are always ... up to be more to the Democrats because I really think most most independents in this country we were Democrats and if left the Democratic party on the Democratic party left them\nI don't think most the most Republicans are independence I saved out those are disenfranchised Democrats\nAnd that the Democrats ... ... and that's why I don't want to be called the Democrat because it's not the Democratic party I used to belong to it doesn't even resembling there's nothing in it there's no trees that drives me to see that it represents anything that I stand for\nAnymore as a party\nDo you agree or disagree with the fall which they've been elected officials do not care with independent voters like me think\n\nOverwhelmingly that people poll thirty four hundred out of five thousand thirty five hundred out of five thousand said that's what they believe\nIn two thousand sixteen over twenty six million Americans were barred from voting for president primaries do you think Democrat and Republican Party should open up presidential primaries allow independence to participate in of course\n\nAnd I can't participate and I do participate but I have to declare a ballot when I went to vote\nSo when I went to vote as a honor roll voter I have to say give me a Republican ballot or a democratic ballot\nThen immediately after many voting I go back onto the honor roll voting list I don't have to re enroll anymore but I don't have both balance I don't have all names I think the whole thing should be changed I had my way if they really wanted to get respect and I think all the names you ought to be on the ballot\nAnd you want to be a Democrat or Republican put a deer in our after your name I think on the names ought to be on one ballot and the top two people in the primary top to have a run off in November\nIf there's two Democrats two Democrats or Republicans are still Republicans you did with national yesterday what\n\nI mean you have to work it through what we got to change the system\n\nDo you think that at least one independent presidential candidate should be included in the president's image of course but that person has to be viable\nSo that person instead of being longing to a party would have to have his own organization or her on the news they should go around to all fifty states get the signatures necessary that puts them on all fifty ballots\nAnd all fifty states whenever the number is eight inches over an once you get the number is eight years then you should be at all on the same age we were talking about this yesterday a little bit\n\nAnd then finally when I was just a whole whole and all of these things they got to the word respect Joseph ... respect you if you're an independent and they asked us now they want but they don't respect\n\nYou can't go to a convention they developed a platform they don't reach out to you you're talking about one of the fifty\nPercent of the voters of this country they don't ask your opinion on anything\nSort of potty decides what the party platforms are going to be at a party decides who the candidate she's going to be the party goes out there and plop sees people write in your lap and says vote for either one\nOr once in a while we have a chance to have a third party candidates that has no chance of winning at all or they can't raise the money and they can't get the profile up in the media won't play the game\nActually yeah that's really\nAll right moving along let me talk a little bit about um this situation\nOh Harold and I thought that not as well where are they getting the million dollars\nFrom China and Iran are really that you know\nThat's what I heard you know I I have no I mean knowing calling me from Iran and only call me from um but then when I was told 'em a natural um um where I have of found a information is that China and Iran have been supporting\nUm Venezuela and uh that to this movement wants to disrupt our political system\nWho like because any\nTime that I Do certainly our enemies\nAnd be again yeah I mean I'm I think we'll find out when we signed the drama and I find that within twenty four hours a day when he accomplished a Democrat you're yet and make that we can\nLook at well I mean like he said blaming Donald Trump ... what about Maxine Waters bad by which calling for violence what about um because of Hillary cooking provide\nAll you have to recall that says a new study when high horse chicken\n[laughter] kinda funny I mean it's you know I got a lot in junior high school getting baby in light of the coin that somebody's going to send a bomb\nThat well I I don't know about that you and I mean I don't know I mean these are these are real he's a real bombs someone may soon you\nKnow I've had every kind of cat\nThat I I understand but they're real bombshell the ATF the FBI the secret service these people don't do these investigations for nothing\nA loan on someone else someone is sending the bombs and whether you're a Democrat or Republican that's not the way America works and they've got to be caught and they going to be punished and much just pray to God that nobody gets killed or nobody gets hurt and I don't care what the Democrats or Republicans if they're in\nBecause everybody\nHow was the name right now I Know that we're going to blame Trump\nOr because of because of his discourse but I don't care about the blame I Want this guy who I thought yeah I just asked Steve ... almost died because you're a liberal left wing or ... or ... ... ran for you as much as everybody else\nAll right ... thank you appreciate it I'm All right
