moving on to other issues the president is on his way to Pittsburgh and to um pay respects to the\nTrust of the ah that took place there over the weekend on\n... which is the Sabbath they up Saturday and those are the Jewish religion and he's going to see the victims that are still wounded in the hospital and the police officers and of course anything that Donald Trump does is surrounded and controversy\nEven the point of the president and honest they paying\nNo matter what he did was wrong you couldn't do anything right to\nSelf Donald Trump decided not to go to Pittsburgh he'd been roundly criticized by people in the press as being a centrist insensitive cold cold hearted anti Semitic I'm no matter what he did use going to be wrong\nHe decides to go in the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh play politics and said the president shouldn't be coming here till after the funerals\nThat is so absurd that kind of a comet um\nIt's the time for the families I mean prices from ... from George Bush to brush Obama to Bill Clinton traveled to mask because all the time and memorial services and funerals\nAnd on top of that is the president not estates you should always be well for no matter who he is no matter what your political philosophy is he didn't cause anything that happened in Pennsylvania it wasn't his claws the guy that the guy that killed on those Jewish people hated Trump\nBecause Trump he said Trump was on June ... has his daughter married a Jewish grandchildren and he has a a and a has a a a Jewish son in law who is Jewish parents by the way a escape from the

about Donald Trump\nHidden costs that he's not an anti Semite but the politics of it just makes me sad is that was really a today just made me sick made me sick and then I watch\n\nAnd you could say I was waiting to find out where the mayor of a Pittsburgh what does ... sure as hell is a Democrat\n\nThe president's gonna come it's not going to hurt anybody maybe you can get some sauce to somebody

should be the president and chief with his wife should be in Pittsburgh\nBecause if he did go to Pittsburgh you'd be criticized and now he goes to pitch Murray he's being criticized no matter what he

I have I have heard nothing about that and ah and I I I just think he's a hater and um\nYou know that's fine or by all I hear about this young young boy in a in Connecticut\nUm he was mentally ill\nAnd um his mother who live with him or he lived with his mother knew he was mentally ill and watch in the in the process of getting a court\nOr to uh have him committed\nWhich is not an easy thing to do OK and governor bake it has been working in Massachusetts to make it easier for the medals and has been successful with him and know what's on the governor of Toledo now\nThere is a question I raised my mind that woman was killed by her son\n... why did you have guns in her house that we're not in a clean safe that he didn't have access to knowing that our son\nWas ... and very violent and would spend all day long in a darkened room playing video games\nWhy we put herself into a position where I actually rationalize you\nSay it once I just want to give a yeah go ahead or fat\nDevolve fall off sorry I was probably about sixty and it was a a store around the corner if that's so these fake gone with the you know you shot it sounds like a real gone yeah so I don't care for\nAll right you can't uh can't use derogatory word so\nUm that's my runs out here and a toilet words you're not allowed um didn't mean anything by it nice guy just can't do it anyway um let me get back to the explanation\nWe had this terrible situation in Newtown, Connecticut\nShouldn't even found all those little babies smarter before they could\n\nLive life to any of its\nFullness parents\nEver to the dying breath living with the horror\nOf what one sick individual was able to\n\nBabies\nAnd we've had a subsequent events before and after\n\nWe even had an event a Saturday and assume that\n\nWe've had them in schools and colleges\n\nPlaces of worship laughed church down south\n\nWe have um every week every day and some cities and\n\nMet someone on this is a big driver\n\nSo let me give me a warning if\n\nWhat if we really had discussions in this country about mental illness\n\nWhat if we really got serious about mental illness\n\nOr if we really got to spend some serious time at the federal level\n\nChanging laws introducing laws and enforcing laws\nThat allow some mental now we're talking about the\nConstitution and people's rights\n\nThan an outcome middle for a period of time\nTo ascertain whether this person is a danger and threat to society\n\nKnowing full well that there's no fuel science\n\nDoctors will be wrong ... will be wrong\n\nBut where is the conversation this is my point so after each of\nThese incidents happened we we begin having conversations about gun control\nToo many guns yeah fifties and it's\nLike I could have Matt just play a rerun of shooting after shooting and then like everything else it or it just subsides it just goes away\nThe conversation eases in silence is no longer the prime of Fisher conversation of the day it's no longer the issue of the day it's no longer the most important aspect of the day\n\nIt no longer drives the engine we move onto the next discussion\nWhy\nMe why we always going to happen again and we know one of the major causes mental illness not an excuse\nYou can't just use that as your Trump Card that's your issue Scott to get out of jail free but we have a serious mental health crisis in this country and in the\nBut we can't worry is a world we have to worry about our country that's all we have to secure our borders because we don't know who's coming in we can't even control who's here natural bond absolutely have every right to be yeah but when they're mentally ill somebody's got to do something about it\nSomeone knows that these people are acting ironically and yet people decide a couple of different things even family members they decide not to get involved well I don't want to get them\nOff how many people like the other way how many people how many people stop and get involved how many people are fearful of getting of all how many people don't want to get involved it's not my business how many people decide it's too dangerous to get involved\nOr how many people in a family say long enough on my on my plate I just can't take it\nLaunched don't allow us\n\nThere's a balance lady justice has a scale this cannot be a balance see\nThen allows us as a society when someone appears to be dangerous to have a vehicle to take that person and yes remove some of their rights temporarily and I don't say that easily 'cause I don't want my rights taken from me\nCity has just hit the fancy\nOf the media that Trump uses as whipping boy every single day and it's like you know it seems like Trump launched doing it and it's like saying love getting it\nYou know so it just kind of just doesn't make sense just\nThat's what makes sense do you remember um\nDo you remember New Hampshire the last presidential election Hillary Clinton was in do you remember headquarters windows shut out do you remember the national attention that took\nLittle town up in New Hampshire investigation that ensued she wasn't there how much big news that was\nSo this is what is happening all around us so what Trump says fake news and the and the attacks the press it's his pivot point and the press\nContinues to feed into it and attach Trump for rising tides are making people ugly in Haiti\nCalling him a hater while they spent all of their time hating on Donald Trump should I get these two little children and the ... in the box and that in in the in the neighborhood you got the press\nYou know middle children and you got Donald Trump piece of middle child and he got 'em in the plane the plane was saying and then throwing sand in each other's face and it goes on every single day and they both mom it made no bones about it the press knobs at\nA press loves the attack they don't feel threatened by Donald Trump and Donald Trump doesn't feel threatened by them they have both launching patch for each other but in between that sand being thrown at us\nSome out of the Senate good in my eyes in a blind to me from what was really going on because now we can't get your reports

where they're coming from it it could be that they're coming from this could be people in here that are coming from the middle east we don't know where they're coming from we have no idea where they're coming from for sure I get all the rice Richards was talked to Bill Bill\nThat good afternoon or Jordan I'm a I don't know if you know this and you can look it up\nBut I'm In a group of people that have a ... a and Fifteen asylum\nOr can go to the nearest coffee which happens to the Mexico with offering them job food and and uh I'm a ... according to international law they must accept the first country that a faith that men\nAreas but they don't care about international law they've already made it very clear they don't want to be a Mexican all\nRight well let me get my point okay now after that I'm an invasion and I'm surprised that the United states has a he take the no\nUh uh to defend their country ... from ... in a way it is and I'm I'm not going to war I'm not only that it meant to set it what could bring the than we've had lethal month polio everything coming in half\nAnd uh they wanted to make thank toward that fact formerly faith has\nWar without a think tank but that isn't tonight's in a war now Mexico offered them asylum and they feel that they want to do the United states\nNow that you've done now is that common here nobody's going to do about stop them how can\nWe say that all day long I Want to know what what what are you know what are you making what are you what tell us what happened what would you what do you expect jihad\nUsing she uh what do you want them to do what do they cut out for a little high that you ran on a price on that and that's\nYour ... okay so you don't have an answer because someone's gonna have to do something about it they're going to stop them and I want to know what people are willing to see happen are you willing to see them that it's not going to be the military willing to see people shot and killed at the border is that what you want to be seen\nOr you'll just see that or you will lead to find ways of uh in ... which we can't do because we don't have the facilities to do it is it a rest and released because much that the law says once they step on foot on this man\nThan they should not just be a shoved out of here they have to be arrested\nAnd because what they were doing is they're asking for political asylum\nAnd then we we are laws so what what are you planning to do the conundrum here's what do you do with that it's easy to say the constitution says what are you going to practically do with them five thousand ten thousand people you seek out who the military and opened fire on them\nYou see that is going to happen I mean I've just asking for practical conversation\nWas talking to Jim Jim\nJordan hey you know the twenty two million we could probably account for fun show that the politicians that outside of a man\nAnd look at the people going in the evening and it was a lawn and and do all the services around the out because of the problem with a lot of our politicians that are employing a question of old people\nWell that's going on for years and every once in a while they're caught\nOh that's it I mean you know\nThere's a whole bunch of businesses in this country to moms or is it by ... sure I understand that and this is happening committee where there's a lot of good people in that caravan I'll bet you that really are just looking for better for their families and their children in a in a hope for a future\nWhat the hell they process there's got to be a legal process and we have to have you on a health or not you know\nAnd that by allowing added value in that day\nBut this is what you get when you don't have a for um\nImmigration policy in this country that we haven't had for years\nWhere we don't have ... where we don't have a plan in place\nThat we don't have security in place that we don't have a fenced in place that we don't have a wall in place and we don't have the manpower in place and the laws in place in the camp in some place in the tent cities in place to take care of these types of contingencies\nAnd this is what happens when a country doesn't plan when a country refuses to have a song on immigration plan this is what happens and the Democrats and Republicans are responsible for this because they've been playing this game of pingpong for a long time and haven't resolved it presidents all the way back to the Reagan when this happened over and over again and then they just give\nOkay what kind of given amnesty\nAnd we start all over again but we're going to have a tough immigration policy well tough means enforced and when you can't enforce I mean we can't even find people in that that that does that have visas in this country I mean they can they can tap your phone we are American citizens of rights are violated in every single day and we can't find them eagles in this country\nWe should be building and put it together tent camps that are incarceration points for people that are coming in to should not be a catch and release program we've got to stop that\nBecause these people are contracting family members and friends that are in the United states and there and the catch and release and they're stolen telling them how great it is up here and so we've got to stop it you're going to break the dynamic you so here's how it's going to be that if I had my way I Wish president\nThere would be a tent cities are built humanely mothers will stay with their children we would uh fortunately or unfortunately we would provide the medical attention and the food but\nThey would never be allowed to be released into the United states\nThey will have their day in court which they're allowed to have under the constitution due process whenever that time would come maybe six months maybe nine much uh we wish you retire more judges or to handle these types of immigration cases\nIf they can prove to it to a judge that it is dangerous for them to go home because of the of of a political ramifications against them\nThen obviously the safe harbor United States failure to do that they're going to be deported but we can't let them into the country disappear in the night so build a city build a tense\nTreat them with respect and dignity understand there's going to be costly but\nWe're not going to be able to mould them down and he thought that we're going to open fire on these people it's absolutely ridiculous and insane it's not going to happen and it and about what we can't is also ridiculous insane to believe that we should catch and release and then these people will have a court they they're going to show up that's\nJust plain old stupid and that's been going on since Reagan days so we got to stop on this foolishness Trump should honor immediately United\nStates military to build these tent cities to put up above a fence around it to the point of the U.S military security around that\nIt's got to be difficult it's not going to be easy\nIt's going to be radicalism is going to be threats there's going to be a martyr things what this president on this Congress cannot allow these people to be taught and released into the fabric of this country we've got to break the cycle\nEnded up right the site was not catch and release that includes the cycle that encourages the cycle so break the cycle and then to point it\nIf they come back again that caught\nThey go before a judge that maybe they were incarcerated then at the point it it got to get tough with the deportation and if it means that we have to spend millions of dollars to secure our borders to do this then that's what we have to do\nWell let's stop talking about we're going to stand there with the military in Iran fifteens was an open fire we're not doing that\nWe're not going to do that and no one wants us to do that no one that right mind wants that to happen I don't want to see pictures of us and the U.S military mowing down people suggest that constitution it's against the rights of against someone who we are as human beings\nBut we should not catch and release that has to stop it has to stop now will be
