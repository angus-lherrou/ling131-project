Baker of kind of warmed up and and got his mojo going and\nHe um I think he absolutely beverages house if I heard one more time she can always say that he um\nIs going to be the leader is going to lead for you and we're going to get things done and I'm not just go to manage I'm going to lead\nWell you see one one of one of the problems you have in life is when you are going to track record\nThat's always a chill\nWhen you have a track record and we have a track record what happens to you is that you have to you have to be called on the track record\n\nSo ... was taken on ... ... ... ... evidently forgot that he was secretary of amen amen is ration of finance under governor Deval Patrick for almost four years\n\nAnd during that he now the secretary administration finance is the financial guy for the ... that\nHe does the budget she you know the governor is the overall guy but you know he's the chief financial guy and that's exactly the same job that Charlie Baker had under the will salute cheat sheet\nBaker also had a job as secretary of health and Human Services and both of these guys came out of the health service industry\nSoaking solace forgot that he was there\n\nDuring the devout Patrick years showing he snatched taken on Baker about what wasn't done\nThe his administration make it goes right back at him and says well while you were there\nThis is what you did your telling everybody what you're going to do why didn't you do it when you had a chance\nIt was a it was just a gotcha and then it's honest there's like a one trick pony he just kept on combat and say the same thing I'm I'm I'm a I'm going to tax the rich is it's the Democratic monitor that plays out over and over and over and over again and I understand this is a tough state this is Massachusetts\nYou know I mean a real right wing conservatives there's not many of them and he kept on attacking the governor because Jeff deal\nOr that Jeff deal is a very right wing conservative and the governor was a moderate and the governor's suddenly I'm running for governor I'm not running for Jeff deals like I said before that I Would support the Republican ticket well you're supporting the Republican ticket and uh and uh therefore your uh uh anti abortion\nCoverage that amount of anti abortion and I've told you I Am pro life initially went back and forth so I'm I was watching it and I think by the time and the hours up\nI think ... hours promised me everything except his first one um I think that's what it was I think I think he put up every intercept his first on or that he was going to as he was going to give away\nUm he was going to revolutionize everything he was going to change everything she'll bake it came back and said okay\nWhen you were secretary administration of finance you cut a hundred and fifty six million dollars from age dependent children children that are indeed\nA you're talking about everybody bought the poor and about the the families that are indeed and you cut a hundred and fifty six million dollars in your budget from the families that are ... why should people believe you know that when you governor you're going to increase that\nAnd then he said to him and when you were secretary bin ... people that were homeless mothers have a home was with children lived at hotels\nHe says since I've been governor that people are out of the hotels we found them housing which support services so you tell people what you're going to do but I'm going to tell you tell people what you didn't do when you had the opportunity to do is you know well yeah but I but I wasn't governor\nSecretary administration finance you obviously went along with it you didn't quit\nSo once bacon got his mojo going um it was quite obvious\nGonzalez stands for increased taxes now the by word is always increase taxes\nOn the rich but you pay bond fools I you know when the cry comes out that will get into that we're going to impact the ritual going to tax the rich\nRich always find a way not to get tax so much they set up shelters and trust funds and all this kind of things you know as a pick up the tab\nYou just want to track record\nI don't care who promises your what once you start talking about increasing taxes and on top of that since August ... have to work with the legislature there were only two people\nThey're going to work on the Democratic legislature Johnny ... has been able to work both sides of the aisle and working very effectively that's why she got twenty two mayors twenty two democratic mayors of Massachusetts are endorsing Charlie basically ... that's unheard of\n\nSo good silence retake after that come back after that well I have money Walsh in Boston that can make money wash has never met a Democrat he wouldn't back if the Democrat was are being laid out in a week and he was a candidate Marty Walsh would endorse\nThat's all Boston politics that's all it was so um [noise]\nAnyway uh really doesn't have any clue I thought he had a good point uh I thought he was starting to have a good point 'cause obvious on the state police point then governor came back and said wait a minute the colonel is got forty two of a members of the state police that she has recommended to the U.S attorney for investigation\nWhat are you going to do\nWell this'll be going on for years she should yeah it has it's been going on in your administrator were you there I went to about Patrick\nWhere did you do about nothing true peace been there since they built the master\nOf by folks she'll be is no more but\nTroop able or the or the or the officers that were assigned to the masters to stir up like I Know that because I spent seven years on the turnpike authority they they work and when that was paid for by the turnpike authority\nThey submitted a bill we pay we bought the cause we bought the uniformly we paid for every your toll is paid for that these top stole money they only go to jail they ought to lose their pensions\nSo I don't know if you watch that if you missed it you miss nothing if a\nIf Charlie bake it can't be this guy a discussion on my way is a total lightweight that's the best the Democrats have um [noise]\nAnd it could be totally contrary to what I saw\nWe all have our prejudices if we know people that are in the business we have a license dislikes\nI Know in Michigan is obviously watch them know Charlie Beck watched\n\nSo how non biased where it'd be a book called the schottische I see it I'll tell you this if Baker blue wouldn't last night I Would tell you he blew

years and I've been blessed to have some in some of them are in politics\nAnd I respect people that do a job that they say they're going to do and do it honestly with integrity and wish you and the guy in carrying out and that's why I support the police do Baker ticket ... they promised us what they do when they deliver\nMore than they promise\nAnd they didn't promise they'll say\nAnything that

radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG double duty ADHD Worcester and I urge radio station [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts one of the biggest storms and one of the biggest sell off ever only\nIt's interesting that in the midst of of what's playing out it's always difficult to to know exactly what's causing people to make the decisions they're making but you wouldn't think so if you turn the TV on and listened to all of the talking heads up predict what what the reason will be when they look back at why the market's done what it's done\nIs ... it's ironic that just yesterday quarterly statements made people's mailboxes Monday or I should say Tuesday here in Massachusetts and\nUm the folks to open their statement and\nThey've been used to hearing for for months now that the u._s. stock market indices have reached all time high\nWhen they open their statement a lot of them were surprised that the return wasn't what they had expected what they hoped\nSo I reached out to clients across the board and send a message out saying you know what if we had all of your money\nIn that single asset class us stocks you would be up to the direction of the market and what you've been told by the media these all time high but you would have taken more risk than would have been appropriate almost across the board regardless of where you when you are in life you wouldn't put a hundred percent stocks\nSo I sent the message out and I got a great reply for a number of clients who said you know it's good to keep in mind that we need to have the parish to pack\nLo and behold today [laughter]\nThe market has this tremendous a drop in a percentage terms it's it's a lot for one day um and it's just the opposite sentiment well thank goodness we have the parachute pac man and our return is not very inspiring but it's at least in positive territory and we don't have to worry about\nHaving the stock market um it rode a portfolio balance which means changing lives changing plans having to alter goals I'm so a balanced portfolio is is uh is is most important when you're when you're talking about how you've got your portfolio invested why what's happened today I think the question you asked\nThere's lots of reasons there's little things you can put your finger on in the middle of it\nCompanies that are are in the midst of a share by back well they can't fight back their own shares in the days proceeding their earnings announcements\nSo they have to stop buying their own shares back that was a factor today that ... wasn't as much buying pressure that was selling pressure earnings that are coming out over the next week or two are expected to be not as inspiring as we saw at the end of the first two quarters\nSo you've got that and then you've got a backdrop of a China a trade war heating up and interest rates are rising wages are starting to pick hire all of those things\nMight have caused the overreaction today um that's at least my sense of of white played out this way\nOrange so and that makes a lotta sense I'm so he's from a lay perspective admission was sentient surely as you develop a portfolio and I I I Know as I Do commercials for you everyday and ... the\nScene that you do in tough on national services does as we can have a balanced portfolio so you're not all in one way you know who she counted the Fitch of one person or that that shoe doesn't fit every person so everyone comes you with a little different\nA set of circumstances value or age or how how does that play into where how you put a portfolio we've been together\nYou know we we we start with sort of a framework in all cases but you're right everybody is unique and their goals don't align perfectly with other couples see you've got folks\nEven among couples you'll you'll ask a question maybe the first time they've ever had to answer it and they're married\nI have to a couple of when do you want to retire and you'll have them both blurted out different ages\nSo um it's uh it's about creating a portfolio that's going to help folks achieve their goals and being realistic\nAbout the expected returns about what inflation might do to affect their buying power and to helping folks uh arrive at a set of goals that are achievable\nAnd I've always said anybody can retire pretty much at any age you can own a house or a car and you might not be doing the types of work that you are that you'd want to do leading up to that but um\nIt it it it's it's different for everybody I guess is what it boils down to nobody has there's no cookie cutter portfolio uh we take what clients have accumulated that they bring to us that are good the positions are great they're well thought out there well managed fund we keep them in the portfolio\nIf there are reasons that other positions maybe aren't as competitive and the space we recommend alternatives and and that's how you end up with a portfolio that serves\nThe clients needs that will weather the storm and date it's like today and um make it to the goal and these are some times ten twenty retirements at thirty and sometimes forty year period\nSo they have to be well thought out I'm a allocations till we can again stay on pace for whatever the goal happens to be\nRich you know ever since a somewhat sickly always my life and has been a\nYou know top of the world for for a while and then something happens in the bottom falls out\nAnd maybe some people don't have that dramatic shift in their life but um I've had I've had a couple of them and and then the economy itself as well as I watched it over the years it\nOr we go through very strong periods of growth and sometimes a little bit more muted and then this recession and sometimes it's very deep in my lifetime I guess the the ones who are in the Obama administration was the deepest I saw that at least I can remember I I'm sure there was more of that but so how do you plan that in that in that uh\nYou know the scale of of of how would you invest in you know certain people are going to see above a real wave of differences that portfolio and the values\nRight absolutely you know just as an example I guess a today the Dow Jones had a bad day the index is still up twelve percent over the last fifty two weeks it's still up three and a half percent for the year\nThe S. and P. five hundred similar numbers so um it's uh it's about a long term perspective certainly if you had time to the equation when you're creating a portfolio you almost eliminate all of the other concerns that could exist\nBecause ultimately in this society especially we have a greed component an entrepreneurial spirit stocks are going to go higher if they didn't nobody would ever owned them\nSo you had time to the equation that helps and then uh you you try to shift a portfolio just based on the biggest a big pictures you don't drill down to try to decide what Internet company might have the ... the latest a\nScandal or security breach or might have the best product coming out\nYou look at the biggest a big pictures and realize just what you said Jordan markets are slick cyclical interest rates are cyclical everything in nature it's cyclical if we reached a point where evaluations are higher than they've been historically say in the stock market then maybe it's time that we evaluate alternatives\nWe don't abandon and ethics class but you can certainly shift\nYou're focused the waiting of your portfolio to be in a better position when what we expect\nTo play out again based on the fact that it's cyclical we know what's coming on that when it plays out that you're not affected as dramatically and the negative sense and that maybe have been able to exploit that\nUh and take advantage of the categories that might be doing well in that cycle it's not about being ... right or wrong right it's about being early or late\nIf if I'd rather be early 'cause in in a cyclical economy and a cyclical stock market it is going to happen I'd rather be early I think the late when it comes to making sure the portfolio is kind of weather the storm\nIs how do you how do you address that each individual customer I mean each one is different so you individualize each portfolio I imagine between stocks and bonds mutual funds\nUm I don't know foreign foreign stocks or American stocks I mean you don't do this kind of you don't do one size fits all also you can go to a you know a large a large a ton of customers so each one has to be individualized specifically\nRight well it's the way we do things and it's not the way you know bigger firms do I know the\nYeah it it's definitely important to us and we don't make wholesale decisions we involve our clients and that decision making a ultimately everybody sense of risk the word risk and what it means is different and what we like to do is we try to quantify risk\nIn a way that makes more sense I think is to say hey this mix of assets these specific assets\nOver the last ten years let's say has seen in the worst\nTwelve month period a loss of twenty five percent and the that's twelve month period a return of\nForty five percent how do you feel about that kind of volatility and and potential and by putting numbers dollars in front of somebody making a decision about risk it tends to resonate\nBetter and they can really a drill down to a number that they're comfortable with and then we designed the portfolio around those parameters\nAgain with the idea that the goals the client is laid out or that you have your your if you want to be on track for\n'em so we don't take more risk than is necessary that that's a mistake that's the green component that is what's going on yesterday people calling wanting to buy more stock you know what tomorrow will be is the fear component people calling and saying we want to sell stock that seems like the end of the world and um it's just\nSelf discipline a long term goals and uh we take\nEach clients individuals' sense of things and and uh a sense of risk and try to incorporate that in as well so in the end they can sleep at night but they could still make it to where they're headed\nSomebody rich hold on to do with all the comment you or is she bus going so\nDecade in my career is\nWe're all living longer and the chances of having issues with memory and dementia has increased\nSo we're we're very aware of that and we always try to have a family members or other\nParties identified by the client with permission to contact them if we suspect there might be some bad decisions being made or somebody just doesn't seem like themselves\nSo again I guess everybody has different if if somebody has more experience with investments we have a much more a sink conversation if they're not we describe it in terms that they can understand a but round out the conversation with all the other issues that generally come with those retirement in later years\nHow do you work in concert with the family um uh maybe attorney town in yourself\nI I like to I mean a lot of folks use the term but I'll say I like to be the quarterback um in trying to coordinate all of the professional working with the family but it is very common for us to start by saying and it depends on what the\nThe parents and a lot of cases are trying to do the clients are trying to do but a lot of times we have the whole family come in and we say you know there's this\nIs a cultural bias that has folks not wanting to talk about money and by not talking about money often times that it causes a rift\nLater on in the family 'cause there'll be disagreements about what it mom or dad really mean and how did they they told me this and I interpreted it one way so if you get everyone in the same room and you can have the conversation and you can answer tax related questions estate planning related questions at the same time\nThere is a much higher likelihood that that family will remain connected and remain a family unit after of a loved one a patriarch or matriarch died\nSo it's a it's communicating first family making sure everyone's on the same page understanding Gulf and then saying All right well based on these ... these are the professionals your you'll need to talk to 'em if you have your own wonderful will will share with them what you\nAllow us to give us permission to um if you don't we have plenty of folks we can introduce you to that we know are competent um to get again done what you want done and most important I think for most people is to make sure the family or their legacy\nOf financial legacy and that their family can last beyond their years\nNothing like a couple of bucks to put up a family\n[laughter] it's a I have a few uncles that her funeral directors and some of the stories they have are are\nReally a fascinating a human nature I guess now I could\nTell you one in my family but as to what's on another day hold on a regular user back then I Want to talk to you both the feds want to talk about ... I'm a China\nAnd also I Want to find out you know I I I Want to our audience to know a little bit more about rich or you're going to be in a road race coming up and you play another role in this community rather than a financial planner so a little bit more of all ... really is when we come back we're going back you know\n\nThis is Jordan let me show and the amount of officers it's just been unbelievable the quality of life has been unbelievable finished changed the whole outlook and how people see the city news radio five eighty ... boy died after ...
