I was really thrown by this they just put a thirty three million dollar a landing system up it was to report and um\n\nThe reason for that is there's always been\nA a a belief\nBecause of a thousand feet of what's to report that day would be far out and flights would have to be diverted that was one of those things that people use and Ashley statistically or the fall I doubt aspect of western ... was really are not much more than any other report if you looked at the statistics over the years but\nUh that was one of the issue is that they made up for anything so we now have American Airlines up up in which the real point which is a great thing and a mask was doing a great job getting them\nBut they had to divert a plane and cancel another one from coming into what's the regional airport in the last few days\nWhich led to cancellations on the mornings out bound flights as well and so that's how I was reading the headline said cloud cover it was to rip what disrupts American Airlines schedule I say the hell is that all about which is already three million dollars\nOf our money to make sure that they travel would not\nSock it any more so than it would um\nLogan Airport or Chicago o'hare and find out that uh American Airlines is flying each for each one forty five year craft which uh\nDon't have the equipment inside to use the cat three landing system is that regional yeah planes are small airplanes\nAre so high much had to divert to other airports\nEver oh ten purposes that pretty well sucks\n'cause I I Know I travelled a lot and you go to the airport\nAnd suddenly you find out your ah your flight has been canceled\nOr because you can't get out that's you know you have boys it that's one thing if ... if you'd call ahead but after the cat's there are three system is up there and they spent ... million dollars so\nI Hope I'm we're going to end and here's here's the conundrum I find myself in Israel, Why I'm Talking about yeah can't yet ridership up for\nThe American flight or defies between two cities if you're not going to be consistent and people can't rely on so if\nAmerican Airlines is only going to use these embryos for a one forty five jets that what's there's going to they're going to fly between what sort of Philadelphia and I can't count on them and I'm not going to use ...\nAnd that's going to be an attitude that go to a kind of self destructive very now other airplanes like Jet Blue and others don't have that problem\nA bunch of this kind of self defeating themselves and using these regional jets that don't have the technical ability to use the technical things that we have at the airport it doesn't make a lot of sense maybe it's just the testing but\nWhen when Americans is back with the administration of of of Massport\nThat says it is a we haven't been able to grow up business well they're going to have to look at the mirror because people are not going to be planning to fly out of there if there was going to be any chance that when they get up there\nThat these embalm but I'm an ... an Breyer shouldn't say I'm bomber or several name for an airplane and bomber or embryo jets can't fly out of ... so it was cast on Monday Night and a juvenile most ceilings\nWe waited all this time to get it done and\nNot okay um\nThere was a debate the other night uh between us so congressman Jim ...\nAnd a second congressional district house seat that's up to run a aunt is a Republican challenge of Tracy love Vaughn a sprawling type of debate I'm touched on everything from political polarization to immigration to violence against women\nUm\nWe've been presented himself as an experienced legislator\nA who had\nI've earned the right to vote no I haven't ruined the rights of all because I'm a veteran that you're on the right to vote for me they put themselves in harm's way some pay the Supreme sacrifice and families pay the sacrifice so I Am American citizen and we'll have a right to vote\nAnd I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back and just watch people who are not us citizens being given the right to vote or you can't control municipal elections it could go lock them up if there are legal so just\nKind of interesting stuff to uh to kind of chat about today well you know a lot of stuff that you had about ... so\nUm\nWe could talk about Donald Trump's ... last night he had a twin ramble last night he doesn't tweet anymore his ... he goes on he had twelve different tweets last night\nI saw believable twelve different and then he says if the Republicans lose in November in November\nOf\n... which is not my fault [laughter] I've had nothing to do with whether they lose or not I've written the president for two years but I haven't done any sort of chicken anybody off and

pretty good statistics there's no vocational education and training here\nIt wasn't about terrorism\nIt's about maintaining stability but by maintaining for control\n\nSo now China is trying to
