I'm Caucasian but um oh maybe because I'm a Jew and they don't want me to vote I don't do believe that for another argument on different day\nI'm just being made everywhere else but um so uh but\nAnyway is that you just walk in and you say Jordan let me I live in one frustrated and they have a computer and they looked it up and they know there's not a vote in a different place I used to but they have everybody and then they they plug it in and they give you a ballot\nAnd then you put it in the seal them below you put in the machine and uh when the polls close to that you just call me to see it ... it will be open with a warden and a police officer will be there and those ballots will be fed in and they don't know who those ballots from my name is ...\nMy name's ...\nThere's no identification for me at all I voted privately\nAnd are now with the computer they checked me off so I Can't go and vote\nAnd my ... and say here I Am his joined the levee whatever you've already voted\nSo there's no double dipping 'em\nSock like chimney hall or you know the game and they go to the bottom ... state the guys on the bathrooms and give him a dollar and they joined voted for it was a politician and that's why New York passed a law that bottom ... couldn't be open on election day\nBecause all the people that were drunk in the bathrooms used around them all up and put them in a wagon and take 'em all the vote and the guy would stand there and I'm a buck and they were voting for the the ward boss you know so uh those days are I think it would have cleaner and now they get

nowhere should they should have known names on and they are because no one should open that envelope and know how you vote whether that's how I was a ... grafted on Washington not only should know that\nThat was the only thing I didn't like the early voting\nWill I bring that up when you're so I've been um because they are the towns should not be putting names on the ballots\nOkay I didn't want to let you know that All right thanks appreciate it I don't doubt it because otherwise you take away\nThe secrecy of your ballot or not that anyone's you'd open it up and say let me see how Jordan voted well maybe they want and in the privacy the voting booth I have the constitutional right to keep my vote private no one has a right to know how I voted if I Want to tell you I should tell you\nA that's up to me that made that pronouncement uh but um it's not up to the authorities to know or anyone else to know to pre count my balance it's the same as absentee ballots nobody has a right to know how I voted at such a sealed ballot with NO NAME on\nAh my name is checked off that's the end of it so I'm\nDon't understand why they have your name on the ballot in Oxford or anywhere else just not the way it should be done that's a because now you lose your confidentiality and uh that's not\nThat's not the way unless you should be run anyway uh we're rub up against the clock at this point so we'll take a break and we will be back with more of\nThat Jordan ... we'll take a break um we have two callers one from western one who voted in may street school he'll here most or who said that their name was on the ballot with the bar code or or on the envelope I should say\nUm I can tell you that my envelope had NO NAME on it\nUm because it's just an envelope and I don't know how they got their name on the envelope when you registered to vote there's nothing printed I'm so they give you the ballot you go in you tell them who you are\nThey look it up in the computer they hand you the ballots that are of the same ballot for everybody but just know potty you go and vote when you're done voting or the police officer handed you an envelope there's NO NAME on it\nUm and it may be a box code on it um I don't remember whether there's a ... would say that well\nYeah they have to be something to you on that let me let me correct myself now so it would have to be something on it um because they would not know what water precinct dumped from\nSo because at that ballot has to be central ... I'm not correct\nI Am not correct on that it just dawned on me that how would they know where to send it I'm In a one eight pushing for so they send those ballots toward a pushing for and they opened on election night now the name on it\nUm\nWell I may I may be dead wrong or I did not see my name on the ballot because\nUm I Would have been confused about that in upset about that are having my balance you over the water a preaching for I'm not upset about 'cause that's where my ballot belongs and knowing that I'm shaft off in the computer and what a pre she for that I voted\nUh that's fine but they don't know how I voted but once I'm mold saying one aide pushing forward a barcode that's fine so that would have had to have been done and I didn't realize that um otherwise you wouldn't know where to send a ballot um\nWe just heard the same from Holden Spencer\nGuy so I mean that's the way it has to be done to us up uh with that I did not know about the name I did not notice my name and I apologize 'cause I evidently him wrong\nUm I still don't remember my name being on that level um [noise] but evidently is but um I Will check on it and it will be about [noise]\n\nThis is Jordan and let me show me your tone I have to keep on telling lot when you tell the truth ... news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine Afghans double duty Amy\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nFrom that have a duty aging is your mom Diane out over the head of the Massachusetts Police Association is relieved of duty officials say they're investigating disturbing comments or Richard ... published in a newsletter he\nAllegedly wrote that he was sick of social justice warriors and that it was time to meet violence with violence had rainy also serves as a lieutenant in the Arlington police department\nSupporters of question one on next week's Massachusetts ballot are hosting a rally tomorrow if voters approve the question it will set a limit on the number of patients assigned to a nurse at one time the rally is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon ... than Raul haul\nWater main break is blamed for a sinkhole and Wilbur no twenty year old man had driven his vehicle ended the St Paul before repairs were made he had to be pulled out from the car which was later towed out\nGet the latest news twenty four seven at W.

M. W. J. G. charter when Ninety three which this news weather and traffic station\nUh I thought when I was five and seven five five zero zero five minutes to talk to Paul Paul\nHow are you I'm well uh I voted at the same place you did it last week a library and they printed on a label and someone else talk on the on off and it didn't have my name on it [noise]\nOkay [noise] I maybe I did not do sign anything I'm\n\nI'm pretty sure I did\nSee I don't remember signing on his knee and I don't remember I remember the envelope that some of the enemy and I'm old and\nThey the first person when you told them what you were and they verified summit honey and then a label print cut out okay and they stuck on a novel I went to the gave it to the person next to my wife or my vowels\nAnd she told me what I needed to do now and trying to take a quick look at the um [noise] the oil and it could have my name\nOn it see I didn't look at the show I may not have an effect me I was going to call you you'd be talking about the uh some point in time I was going to call you and say that I was a little stir by now\nI Am just everybody right now because I probably would never vote again up early or I decided\nTo give it a try I was very easy but I I Do\nRemember the process I walked in just like everybody else does ah my name and they went right there's little computers roll a hand held computer and found me I mean just a different than the wood I'm no I'm was was\nIt was a paper before was your name Adam ... name ... yeah and uh you know your uh your address and they would put on line through it\nBut I've never been charged for an ID but I don't see why anybody would complain about that\nI don't either but the uh down south we did on this I'm no doubt about the old ... and all that but\nI got to have an idea driving\nUp there and I do do any so you're not going to have a new licenses you have to yet so I'm like\nWell you know what I have a problem with when I go out walking around people are being treated fairly are coming back and saying well quite a mile of it by now you know up to\nGo to go into a bar right poor people or people in that have a right I mean I read something\nIn a line down in Florida but there are a lot from waiting to vote that might actually done\nI don't know if it's purposely dumping it could be yeah it certainly there should be um a a a process where the ... community or has sensitivity to the electoral process and up or should be encouraging people to vote not does not\n... not be a roadblock to people voting\nOr sometimes they sometimes they have to go to court the election so that has to do and put them in junction on to keep the voting booths open cultural wallpaper Massachusetts if you're in line at eight o'clock you have a right to vote off you get into that line after eight or ... you know one you don't have a right to vote\nThey lock the door behind you right\nBut it is at eight o'clock in the ... at night a police officer will go to the last person in line and we'll stand there and every person in front of that police officers a right to vote now that should be a national standard\nFor taking my call\nAlready rich the hip yeah so I mean that should be extended for everybody but there's no question about there are areas or wants to keep the boat toning down its advantageous to a politically to some of these areas that are still in fighting a civil war and other things that you keep photos though\nAnd ah I think we should be encouraging people and that's why early voting shame around I\nYou know which is a but it was funny that I ended up voting that way because I should I wasn't allowed to university and I think there's plenty of time on election day I've got Thirteen hours to vote o seven o'clock in the morning till eight o'clock at night he's Thirteen dollars\nI can be convenient to limit of democracy\nAnd I'll find that too hot I just wanted to try it much more to do the whole show on anyway clout I tried it will be back with a lawyer ... [noise]\nSo there's mediation where generally we deal directly with the\nThe two parties to the dispute\nOr without their lawyers president if they have lawyers and then there's conciliation where we often deal with lawyers what's their clients still in an attempt to get them to avoid the need for a long litigation and usually a lot greater expense and time involved a\nAnd our way so it could be that the two parties have some differences obviously they're going to and they want this mediation process of conciliation process\nOr to work and uh your methodology may be of this one or two major sticking points and those could be resolved through mediation and then there's still going to be ... which with those two points would have been resolved\nIs that it certainly can ban and there's actually in most cases were able to resolve the whole the whole thing\nAnd that would be the better of the of the profits absolute okay\nAnd what we find is that most of the time and we have limited issues they the parties have come to an agreement on most of the issues sometimes they they have only one to two sticking points and that's where we sometimes get involved we can uh do the whole case or we can do just one issue\nAnd we have often time been asked by lawyers by ah by the parties to just handle one particular issue that they can't resolve themselves will come in a for a limited period of time and get it done\n[noise] okay so now you you you get it done and at the end of all your your your good stores were process of of of mediation you had both parties are independent you're listening to each side present themselves and whatever that claiming to be aggrieved by and then you\nJust use is senior only is there a group of lawyers that do this is you know one lawyer that sits in on this\nGenerally it's one lawyer that sits in on it certainly if there's an area that war is not familiar with that somebody else in the group may have some expertise that or you can reach out for advice from that or the lawyer maybe ... ... ...\nWould be the absolute 'cause he ended up ... you would then all of that process you would find a ...\nWell we would actually be tried in the mediation process we're trying to get both of the parties to agree that the\nUh decision or the resolution that we're suggesting is a fair way for both of them to resolve that dispute they're actually the benefit of it is their formulating their own result so it's not somebody dictating to them what is going to be it's them finding that middle ground where they both may not be happy\nBut both can live with the result that they formulated as opposed to being told what the results going\nOK and these these people that we're talking about the people that that we deal that we are we call ourselves neutral so we're in essence the neutral party making decisions but in our world we are we've kind of touched on a little bit we have mediation\nWe can also participate in something called conciliation and then we have that third piece that we talked about called private education\nEach piece is different depending on what the what are what the lid against one for example in mediation we have two people coming to room looking to come to an agreement based on their own expectations what they think is best for them\nThat's one thing then we have conciliation and that's a little different in that ah folks come to a room and ... are based on uh what is a range of reason based on the expertise of the neutral\nWe can tell them what their range of reason is a ... in front of a particular judge with a particular issue in particular time\nBased on our experience we can say here's your range of reasons here's your best guess is the worst case\nLet's see if we can come to an agreement within that range of reason not necessarily what they want\nBut what is likely to happen within that range and then third is the private education where a judge just literally tries to case on a per issue basis or in in terms of the full case and rent is a either finding a non binding decision it's not anybody's asking it's what the judge is ultimately\n... does a judge ... decide whether it shouldn't be binding an up on it was it a positive martial\nIs again have to make that decision when he says judge he's talking about one of our neutral so many of them are retired we got a judge or judges that much about the hardest would after great at that decision that that judge makes is going to be binding otherwise it would be non binding and subject to the ...\nIn France to have a judge versus you doing it is what\nI'm oftentimes credibility to the clients they're presenting their case in a formal fashion they uh would be doing so with attorneys representing them and I think those attorneys would be able to\nDiscuss with their client that we've got somebody who's had experience making the decisions in cases like this in hearing actual evidence can be for them and that say usually more efficient way to get their case her\nI think the years that you've been doing what you're doing the kind of people you're surrounded himself with brings that kind of credibility to the to the clients to know that you know these people know what they're talking about so um we can cut the steel and make it you know everyone blocks away with a little bit of no one's happy but uh there's happy as you're going to be\n... and it's about is cost effective way as parties that don't have an agreement resolve between themselves without any help can get everyone wants to\nKnow the bottom line so how do they get in touch with you\nWell or they can call us I'm at our phone number is five oh wait a seven five to zero zero one eight they can email us ... resolve at why litigate dot com or are they can check out our website WHYY litigate one word dot com\nI was pretty easy just check them out in the ... just suggestions you know before you go the route of litigating something you might want to check this out and see if this was an option for you and uh it certainly makes sense to\nTest the waters before you're jumping and find out that you don't want to be in ... I'm sometimes hard to get out\nI agree and even when people come to me for litigation I sometimes\nMost times suggest then that they thought about trying to resolve it through mediation and again that wouldn't be with me that would have to be with another show he did but it's still a good way for people to get resolution to dispute so that they can design themselves as opposed to a third party telling them how their future is going to be ... and done quickly yeah\nEnd on quickly and there's there's no price that you can pay to have something like this done quickly with a lot less torment and emotion\nSounds ... sounds right to me thank you for coming up for re share it with ... thanks alright what's that will take a break a day and we'll be back with mortgage on the show when we return [noise]\n\nGeorge Carlin people\nHigh physician surround\nOver section they are and yet you can why would you support that one\nUse radio five eighty and Ninety ... double duty age [noise]\nNow the latest headlines from the double duty AG newsroom\nRun the WTC a gene is your mom Diane ... convicted mob hit man from western Massachusetts is reportedly I suspect in the beating death of Boston mobster James Whitey Bolger\nFriday gas formerly from west Springfield is serving a life sentence in connection with the two thousand and three murder of uh Springfield mob boss and an associate his name first surfaced in connection with boulders death and a story in the Boston Globe\nMore information is being released about the Eighteen year old accused of stabbing a state trooper officials say ... had been bailed out of jail less than twenty four hours before a police pursuit that ended in ... for the Massachusetts trooper tripper mark Whitcomb is recovering from a collapsed lungs and muscle and nerve damage\nTens of thousands of Red Sox fans spent part of Halloween parade today celebrating the team's fourth world series title in the last Fifteen Years get the latest news twenty four seven at UTA gee that town\nI'm Diane ... radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine FM double duty AJ what's there's news weather and traffic station\nFrom the double duty AG price chopper market thirty to traffic center major problems on two Ninety west bound you have your usual stopping go traffic through downtown from exit twenty down to exit fourteenth then you're slow again pretty much from exit twelve weeks attempt cleaning up an accident right there with your price job or market thirty two terrific I'm bed alter\nIf you see something out there called the double UGA gee traffic hotline one eight six six nine nine nine Seventy\nTwo hundred Hi Jordan will be here to recommend Thomas J what insurance agency I've been talking about them for many years and here's an example of the excellent customer service and hard work that Thomas Jay was delivers a person I was facing a fourteen\nHundred dollar increase in their home insurance premium contracted that the new kind had two claims and the homeowner's policy over the past four years after further discussion which determine the cause of the claims had already been addressed by the homeowner so Thomas Jay ... reached out to the insurance companies they work with\nAnd found one company and was willing to write a homeowner's policy at a competitive rate and save this new client from the fourteen hundred dollar increase which insurance also bundle of this new clients auto insurance with the same property and save them two hundred and thirty dollars just on\nThat premium would save this kind of money by taking time to understand the situation as it goes with the companies to find a solution the team at Thomas Jew woods insurance is made up of professionals\nFrom right here in this area like Walter ... woods to name a few find out more at\nWoods insurance dot com or call them today for a new obligation consultation at five all eight seven five five five nine fourth\nWall from the double duty AG weather center here's the latest forecast\nAfternoon every one meteorologists Tom are partly cloudy guy this afternoon it could be a late they sprinkle or light showers especially ...\nAfter I covered years in the upper Fifteen and cloudy panther the sprinkler like shower low temperatures holding in the upper forties and for tomorrow showers likely temperatures in the upper Fifteen and the outlook for friday morning shower with temperatures in the fifties and you can get your weather all day long on ... the A.

keeping me floating up for the for the afternoon here on the air and doing is a wonderful work as he usually does\nUm do you realize that\nIt's six days to mature in elections six days with all the hubbub and yelling and screaming um six days well actually you know seven days from yesterday but uh at some point on Tuesday night will know\nWhat the next two years is going to look like somewhat of a snapshot of whether or not the\nRepublicans have been able to hold the house and Senate\nOr whether they will lose the house and Senate or the house or Senate and what that will give us and what that will do a the rank or it will not stop but the um the ability to function\nAs a as a nation or will be impaired um because you can expect that this won't be about the mid term elections if uh the Republicans lose the house next week and they cook\nMatter of fact it in the past um eleven presidency's nine ... eleven\nAnd their first off year election the party in power has lost the majority of seats in the house of representatives\nGoing back and whether that was Reagan and that was Bush was that was ... or Obama the President Obama\nHis first term in this off year election last sixty one house votes sixty one seats when Republican and he lost the Democratic house\nUm so that's the norm a party in power in an off year election mid term election shouldn't be off you return the party in power in a midterm election I'm usually\nStatistically historically\nLoses seats\nBut this has turned into something different five different this has turned into a referendum on Donald Trump now don't always referendum on on the pressure\nBut it's not as obvious are not made is obvious by the press as this one has been this isn't about uh the individual congressperson from a district it didn't do the job some other person comes along and knock them off\nOr know what the party in power but it's more about the personality and power and there's even a party in power this isn't about the Republican Party\nOr this is an election about Donald Trump and um I think we're going to find that out on election night now there will be some variance is\nThat there'll be some areas with Trump's still has great popularity and that Congress person may not\nUh you get to kind of recognition uh for a number of reasons\nThe other problem with the Republicans have is a number of strong incumbent Republicans chose not to run this time or you say why if they're strong Republicans and they have this great job in Washington because they lose that chairmanship\nI'm just going to do and and I'm
