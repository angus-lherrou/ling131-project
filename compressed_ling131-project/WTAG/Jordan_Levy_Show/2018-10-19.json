all and it just means it's unscientific here say but it's you know a person talking to four or five others and it's really dangerous to projecting\nYou talked to poor five Democrats who think Trump's okay they're not the best guy with the economy is going great I I don't think I'm going to vote you can't take out those poor people and make it scientific that the Democrats are going to have a turnout problem even though that's what Mike is his ... his point is\nThat the Democrat leadership and the media leadership is really kind of alone they are enraged they are blinded by their hatred\nSo much faith think everybody liked them hates Trump\nAnd that this is going to drive Democrats back to the polls more\nThan anything has since Obama in two thousand eight [noise]\nAnd it's the old it's the old negative there is such a thing as negative turnout\nBut it's not meant as it's been a negative turnout is your turn out to oppose\nSomething that you are Michael e wary of or afraid of ah the kind of negative turnout we're talking about here is Democrats turning out in droves because they um despise Trump and and so forth and he just said\nBut the thing that exists all

big a big difference uh when you see\n'em what's going on here um\nAnd there are a number of Republicans that chose not to run again uh that's because they have term limits and a committee assignments and they didn't want to be back ventures and they wanted to be able to\nUm get the\nOpposition uh all the chairs so um yeah route two hundred and thirty three I'm seats that are up for

Democrats could add possibly thirty nine seats well they need ... seats that are up for grabs yeah they they could yeah and we don't know\nAnd that will be determined to overturn that that that what those are the same people that said that Donald Trump wouldn't win the presidency so um and those are the same people that you know hate Donald Trump so\nUm\nI I guess what I'm saying is to make it as

majority and I wouldn't be surprised to see the uh\nDemocrats take the house\nI Would be shocked if the Democrats took the Senate\nI'd be absolutely shocked because I think the Republicans have a good chance of picking up a some Senator Seitz and we could have a very good to have a larger majority in the United States Senate\nI'm sure you can have a split a situation where the Republicans have the Senate and the Democrats have the house and um\nWe have gridlock\nNow they always say that will be different is\nI'm\nThe president would be able to continue to uh pick his cabinet people without interference by the Democrats because of the house doesn't vote or any of that uh advise and consent of that comes out of the Senate the president would still be able to um\nPick his judiciary\nUh

there are there are many ... are in the community right now that have apartments that they're not renting a there ah they just are afraid of the quality of the ... that's going to be able to\nShow the city manager has been working on a process through his office of of trying to get a data availability of those units available for poor poor is not a crime a poor is not a shame\nImporters would make you a bad person and a rich are just not a crime in Richardson out of shape and rituals and make you a good person\nThis is a balance to this and certainly again the college corrupt costs money for schools where reimbursed for that other states it's not money we're reimbursed for that\nThey're a housing needs and benefit needs and we are reimbursed for that again on Monday\nBut warehouse community and we're going to be the magnet for\nSocial services whether we like you know not every city or in this country is the magnet for social services are cities like San Francisco Los Angeles Seattle\nBoston a Cambridge um\nPeople say Cambridge doesn't have any more weight and they do have family I mean they have crime um so um the answer is that we have not\nBuilt enough housing or to provide a suitable housing for people are\nThat are in the house you know we've been building and washed or or just for the adaptation all of these new units that have been opening up\nA market rental housing ... so when you see these new buildings going up these new laws that are going up that's not being subsidized people are paying market rats somebody's rights are pretty high\nNow the uh the uh\nBuilding I'm it is no it's only market rental there's no subsidies uh uh in that in that building just not a I'm On a loft that are being built in the up and ah all the new housing is being built a ... square a jets or all of that housing market rental housing\nOr the loft that were built next to you and your station was um\n\nI Believe all of market rental or the building that was built on a water street that may be misuse or the old boy's club a that was some apartments where I'm\nA\nSection eight or a subsidize others were not so which mixed use not just the elderly so it's a quandary a in a city you also have social economic variations\nWhere you don't have a ... sometimes you have some very affluent towns if you only get the average income for the people living in the town hold oh they were all living in the town of ...\nOn the living in the town of West role you would find that the average income for those people are far superior to the average income for the whole amount of people that live in a city like Washington\nAnd therefore the services that are rendered services that are needed are going to be far greater in a in a community that provides those types of amenities and people migrate here and again it's it's it's not ashamed to report\nIt really isn't it's not a crime to people\nAnd um it's what we can afford to do\nAnd this should be yeah should be\nA laws that are on the books in Massachusetts that requires these towns to build X amount of University of affordable housing but they get around it all the time and that's basically because the state reps that represent ...\nAlso represent pots of a town and they want to get elected so they're not pushing this thing through\nYou have state senators represent passive Worcester it passes the town's so they're not pushing it through so they tried to incentivize it\nUh by saying that it would be money usually I Would go to these towns if they built it but I think that we're beyond the point of incentivizing or just uh the same as a we have done with other things I think it has to be mandated\nThat for a population you have to have so many units of affordable housing that's provided and I understand there are times like shoes very uh that um is concerned about the growth factors of their schools\nAnd other towns that don't want a a\nTo build housing that's multiple family housing they don't want to mom and dad or mom with four kids are just for kids going to school\nBut we can expect that a city ... going to be able to pick it all up and there's nothing to do with the ballpark has nothing to do with any of that\nUm the ballpark should make money uh uh the farmer and on the uh financial papers that we have seen of the house and just go in with the ball popped is not a it's not subsidized housing it's market rental housing map I'd asked the manager on Monday on the show\nIs it really a nice for all of this new housing\nOr that's market rental not subsidized said yes there is there's a demand in the city for it we should be encouraging that housing is that's upper upper middle middle class and upper middle class housing and we're not subsidize the anything so\nI Hope I answered your question I didn't try to do it up and then the other way that I could to try to explain that a show a vast two of our friends are now coming in\nI I still would like to see 'em and investigations done\nOr about how we're going to I'm\n\nA full on uh how these people coming here and how they're being organized and where the money is and uh that investigation should be taking place by homeland security and uh I guess the state department\nOr maybe they have to be I I don't know\nIs there any lobbying broken by funding immigrants to come here\nThe problem comes when they get to the border\nAnd the president's talking about in the military at the border but you can't put the U.S military on Mexican territory so once they step over that line and therefore I'm only in the United states you can't push them back\nThis is due process more in this country\nAnd even if you are here illegally you still have the rights of due process\nAs I said earlier unless you're a white male that you don't have any ... any due process but you still have the rights of due process so it's a real conundrum of how are you going to handle this and the only place that can be handled is in the country's\nBorders themselves it would be much easier if we had a wall\nTo wall would be on us territory and they were happy to go under all over the wall and that would be easy to patrol easier to patrol and uh that's why they build a wall around Israel and now the Hamas is building tunnels\nAnd matter of fact today there were a a Israeli defense forces or a attacked or in Gaza because they guys ahead sent some rockets a into ... uh and um there was a strike by Israel\nUm to um\nTo answer that they get the message across loud and clear show um that there's a price to pay when you are you do it [noise] so once again uh if\nIf it if we if we weren't getting as much interest from the Democratic party on this issue and even the Republican Party on this issue as we are getting about a shooting\nIf only the press was so so into what the answer is where the people are coming from who's financing where's the investigative reporting in this\nAnd the children that they held that time because people were arrested did not have any uh documentation of the children\nSo now they don't like the photo op is going to be the kids in an ... pound and mom not having her baby and you know people with the hot now with the head All right and you you can't I mean what\nAbout what their heart but let me tell you what it's gonna happen you know and it's been done a writing\nThat do not know listeners out there that had children you're bringing people in that not to not get laid it we don't you know and a quarter million for maybe a billion dollars to to get people and help shape\nThat bringing in it and they already proven that ... had chicken pox what's at me and other than that we had an ad in the country in years but why hasn't why hasn't\nThe president on this white has\nOne man let me let me\nLet me tell you I'm not talking about one man why hasn't\nThe president's call to his office\nThe Senate minority leader now how much a minority leader\nAh and the chiefs of a ... the chief ... ... ... a ... a speaker of the house\nI'm his achieve honcho the U.S a Mitch McConnell and his chief poncho and sat down with the cabinet secretaries revolved in this and have a brain trust and say okay what do we do\nWe know why it hadn't been done\nHave been telling me I don't think the Democrats haven't said one word about this while the Democrats get up I don't\nKnow you can't forget about it you're going to put this monkey on their back that's how you take a photo walk away\nI I really do believe Jordan people notice already I I I I have a little more faith in the American\nPolicy that oh wow so how is that as a people\nIn the rain ... mother is holding their babies come on bill\nMy God get my violin\nUm I can see it all now it wasn't a big mess\nYeah there's a big mess and there's no way is it because we don't have a wall we don't have a policy where the line and ... and the ... the press will do anything they can to rig the selection to make sure that the Republicans moves\nAnd not to mention our immigration laws do wrong\nLaws I remembered racial laws is we have a porous border and all you have to do was come over here where you can find you even if we give you a visitor seven hundred and fifty thousand people were legal visas haven't showed up we don't even know where they are\nJust now that there's twenty two million illegals in this country twenty Joe Millionaire\nShow I was watching a news report last night at the border patrol agent can handle it if they\nDo yes I was in eighty thousand people came over the border\nYeah eighty thousand people these people these border agents control this just I was just watching it in Mexico the Mexican police to stand there and there's a gay and then send your kid comedy is Tom and I just walked right over to the gay\nAnd you know what to call it up to Jordan I feel sorry for people because they made a lot of them may have 'em just reasons for trying to have a better life but ah the point of

I don't know [laughter] look\nLet's say because of the there's a need their um is it ... there's a need but\nI see\nWhere people should have said that\nWhen we H as we age we lose a lot and we started losing a dependence and they see my my father in law was a hundred and four and he said the other day you know I came for yeah for the most yeah\nI told you it on his ... birthday a friend of mine came to him and said Henry two hundred and twenty they said well you're limiting me [laughter] [laughter] that's a real mows the gods yeah there's only ...\nThat's his attitude but when he said I cannot do anything by myself anymore on anything that he does I Need help and I broke my heart\nIt really broke my heart and this is what we're trying to ... to have in our facilities is to maintain is much independence\nPossible and you said about the food they're they're really the food is the last thing that you can still enjoy but what happened let's say\nMost people have dementia that cannot tell you the food is good and bad a sold tee coal whatever they cannot tell you when you go to a restaurant you don't like the service you didn't like the food or what are you coming back\nSo we have a program in our facilities when we encourage family members to come in dying risk their loved ones would you not charge them\nSo we can get the feedback from the family and we had some issues at the oasis at the beginning we hired an executive chef and now everybody's happy\nNow the wages for people to you know I'm ... across the street I'm from the first facility that uh that been a a open to you which is the dodge pot rational\nAnd just right across the street and they built it from scratch yours I told you from ground up they had plenty of problems in the building built I'm just saying a fun just statements as with a lot of Dodgers left with um\nAnd it's totally different because all of the people that are at least ... people that are suffering from dementia or\nA ... and the different levels should do what you taught me maybe some described while listening to go out is that there are different levels\nBut it's not only different levels we have no more than a hundred types of dementia and each person reacts differently so if somebody says one side says oh it's not it's not true so that's the reason why when you\nDo activities you have to do different type of activities that will match the cognitive level of the residents\nYou have to have the size of the facility when one is agitated that you can move that person\n\nInto safer area that he does not educates rest\nSo it's it's a challenge it's a daily challenge and people change on a daily basis\nSo you have to have a system in place it really um can't identify changes and people so you can change your activities on a daily basis it's a progressive disease it's a horrible a progressive disease\nAnd the uh the level of that progression as unknown correct so you really can't guide yourself or some of the program and says oh you're going to be here yeah here today you'll be here tomorrow and you'll be at this stage of the road you can't do that now\nAnd if\nAnyone tells you all this is what you should know we've seen people reacting differently to medication progression was different so you know what I really want from our audience is\nTo take the time and really chicken your spouse or your parents don't wait for the last minutes take the time look for science and I I Want to talk to her\nWhen you have or your parents usually one of them will cover\nSo if you'd call them and says I I was mom doing oh mom is doing great can it and I talked to her and she's asleep\nThat's the way one spouse but the the other one\nSo when you talk to them and you see a little bit memory loss it's okay it's not it's a big deal you know we all have those moments but you need to see the progression of the memory loss if you\nSee they had a difficulty in communicating with you or what was the word that is a sign if\nI let's see go and screen someone an essay a man what did you have for breakfast and that person turns her head and looked at a daughter or son said yeah what did I for breakfast\nThat's a good sign that we have a dimension if we see more anxiety\nThan usual something is cooking\n[noise] if we know December ... nation\nI'm not talking about mom went to the hospital and she started losing anything in the ...\nThat's very common for the elderly but suddenly got all kinds of stories that happened\nThat you should be called sundown to\nSundown as more agitation type in the afternoon okay so it's a ... a you know he tried to kill me ... a ... be stealing the money\nTo something is going on you need to be aware of it um if you see a lot of mood swings\nYou want to be a cautious about that um\nChicken appetite look at the appetite very very common for elderly people that the taste buds and not as it used to be to be be stopped not enjoying the food and by not enjoying the food in this hassle to eat that don't eat\nSuddenly you see they don't like to go to restaurants because the restaurant is a struggle I have to look at the menu reading a menu is something very very difficult so if you take them out into the same restaurant so they know what they had it will be easier for them\nTo be a lot of things that people need to take into consideration and make\nThe life of the parents are the spouse little easier because at the beginning of the disease\nWhere we called the twilight zone they know something is wrong but they cannot pinpoint it was a single what's wrong and that is really frustrating that the person that's happening this happening to them they don't know right there but they know something's wrong but they can't put their finger on right\nAnd that this is the worst part of the disease once you're gone you're gone it's more the people that are suffering now but I think\nWith the past ... to ... I Will never forget we had when when Mike in Idaho facilities in Los Angeles we had the lady a small a they always in pink recalled the drill the sunshine and when they got\nNow you also went to a lot of time with colors\nYes uh my wife I actually who was a an outside there's a name was ... and she's in orders and she spent a lot of time researching the colors for people with dementia so was ... and they'll go far architect\nAnd actually the daughters of marking the make up his two daughters are helped us too\nAnd um we came up was\nColors that calm people it's\nNot only the the wall it's the plates everything\nYeah that'd be you know for me to walk in there and see the paintings and the a ...\nAnd so much openness and the dining area and then a again the ...\nAnd you're walking in there isn't a ramp and all and there's a living area Caribbean play a piano [noise] um and then you go into the bedrooms\nAnd see I'm\nA whole different more than you would ever expect and God only knows they build enough of these places Mooney oh it was it was when you say a whole um it's a whole\nIs not a nursing home it's a whole and that's the in the word I use all the time when I talk about do you um every day is we do you do the uh the promotions um is the duty no words like this\nLittle people are talking about dignity but among doing anything about it yeah but you just don't see about Detroit you really have worked very hard and we spend a lot of time and money educating or ...
