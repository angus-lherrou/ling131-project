enough is why would someone yeah since ... you know you just drunk [laughter] um\nSo anyway it it it's too bad that people have to act that way I'm and I'm Glad that ah the patriots who've taken as a

watched friday night millennia Trump's interview with\nThe CBS News\nAnd I saw I saw she handled herself tremendously well she's a very smart woman which no holds barred interview I thought it was a

her independence\n\nShe showed her a loving care for her husband she talked openly about people in the White House that she didn't trust\n\nShe uh chastised the media or paying more attention to her small worse than what she says and picking her up hot\nThat well now if he was king she would be clean but not an answer is wrong oh I see she would just be way too just acquaintances that now he is not ching\nChing and waiting now is just a you know he's ... he's royalty but he's Ninety seven yeah it's a it it's interesting that all of the uh the royal family men have all had military

and his brother William was a tropical island um\nBut they had to get them out of Afghanistan once it was known that he was there right and uh so there's\nProbably falls and stuff but it's interesting how we the American public\nAre so into or not I'm I'm really not into it but\nUh but many women are but people are very into the whole royalty the whole royal family yet we we declare our our independence says uh and we celebrate our independence from Great Britain and uh we don't want a\nA you know dictatorships that sort of a book queen or a king would be in or if they had the power they would be a dictatorship um yet we find this romance is romantic side of a a castle and the queen princes\nAnd all that and what how does she have she uh she has she doesn't have really any ...\nUm she has social power but are they really have taken away all the power from the queen she does the government has a new prime minister has to go and they have to build a ... in her in her name um she gives a speech once a year to the uh\nA parliament\nShe really they determine budget how much you can spend and she really doesn't have any real world powers [laughter]\nBut it's just like a a a

use American indian status and not as you get a step up on other people\n\nThat have a universe for teaching position because if she did and she's a snake and she was alive\n\nBecause she did she did

be a candidate to a thousand twenty for president\n\nAnd why she gets out of the way has as much as she won't admit it Trump is gotten under her fingernails with little ... livers and he's driving her crazy\nNow she thinks she gets on to Trump's yet that's impossible as his skin has moved on you can't get under his skin is impenetrable\n\nBecause she just comes out and say anything he makes it up as he goes along he doesn't even write a script he'll say whatever he wants to say in a very timely stop saying he'll tell you he didn't say you could run the tapes side by side\nAnd he stands here at

residential sort of committee justifiably by the way so wait a minute we should be change they should be they should be categorized as\nA business that's now ... what does that may\n\nWell it means that you take a whole hunk of more businesses\nNow are added to the business side of the trial balance\n\nThat are going to be paying more yeah they're going to be paying more but by having a lot more over here\nIn the high the business part of the pie is going to be more to slice therefore the size of the slices of going to be smaller\nWhat does that mean that means that the\nCommercial and industrial rate will go down because the percentage that they have to gain\n\nThe big apple pie that they'll have to ... well but then how was she going to happen to a residential enough you know what happened residents residential there'll be the ...\n\nWhat's the size of the pie that the residential factor will have will be a smaller pie size of the industrial and will be a big upon\nHope I haven't lost you try not to say\n\nWell why did I say it wasn't going anywhere\nBecause people\n\nJohn ... old city council said he couldn't support the proposed change but he'd like to see that owner occupied residents will be getting some kind of a task credit on the city\nSo not only do they get a lower tax rate and Eighteen Ninety One thousand now he wants to give it a tax credit\nTo someone who lives in one of those houses I don't know where the money some income from it has come from somebody somebody that has to go to anyone that doesn't uh owner occupied or it has to go to commercial

I was thinking when I only get three decker if whatever thinking when I get free decker with like a Web and a hundred for water after the fact that they\nBuy eight hundred depend upon the number of our building perhaps we could have a right end up on what the owner occupied for the most you can we be on three by three decker and then a different rate\nOr the ones that are owner occupied so I have like I'm thinking of like limited liability corporations they don't want or you know it or not\nThat the ... the owner occupied even though it would be time consuming the job is based on the record that you're going after came through the record going online\nSome means of after painting it owner occupied or is it an act and the oil or they are limited liability ownership of multiple families that are you living on the ... and maybe not ...\nWell ... there's ... well the judge judge a judge Russell brought that up first of all it's legal you'd have to change state law and it's just a that's the only way this could be done so these are the state law doesn't allow you to do that\nAnd a ... and realized that before it was ... on this time they want to do with it and do it and you have to go to the state legislature and get a law passed and we'd have to be and I don't think it'd be a local option wash it would have to be a statewide law\nAnd I think the lobbyists for tenants around the state would a ... this is going to happen just not going to happen\nWell I mean it would be very it would be very costly to have a higher tax rate because I remember how I'll call it was like twenty thousand on fighting\nYou talked to all that well you know you talked on that if ... if you're if you're a landlord you can do just on the betterment you put in your house\nOr whether you live on whether you live in a house or not the only ones that he is the only ones that get screwed here are the single family homeowners because they can't deduct any better much they put in the house\nBut if your whole family homeowner yo you own a three decker\nYou rent one time and two thirds of all the cost of keeping that building two thirds of all the costs are too young to have all from ... my elderly do you have an eyeball from value and you know rather than that you take in okay we got a bright thank you ...\nThis is Jordan let me show I Am a strong supporter of having a full complement of police officers highly trained as we have one Youth Radio five eighty and Ninety four boys\nWill make us election on the architect and of course the architect is critically important and that's the person who's going to take the ideas\nAre and actually translated into a building that that works first and foremost as a baseball venue but also to fulfill all the pope's and promises that we've made to the community about what it's going to be in terms of authentic Worcester connected to the neighborhood\nA catalyst for development um we don't want something that you could go there and say oh yeah I saw something similar and you know city acts or city why we want something that people really\nYou know gravitate to as unique and authentic to west or an is pushing the envelope on what AAA uh ballparks can be and\nYou know the level of international\nYou know talent that was drawn to submit a proposals for the architectural design element of this um we can't go wrong no matter who we picked a it's gonna be degrees and how kind of much we want to push the envelope in terms of the concepts that we're able to employ here um\nAnd one other thing I should mention too that the it's not all going to be done in back rooms so we're getting ready to announce the next day or two with the team a schedule for fan engagement\nUm where they literally going to go throughout the city each city council district and they want to talk to folks about what they want to see in this ballpark in excruciating detail from literally from\nYou know the family change in Rome what do you want to see do you want diaper tables in there do you want you know particular type of a ... to\nSeats to vending stations they really want to engage with the fans ... how do you want the seats to feel look\nEt cetera because they want this to be something that really works for the people who are going to use it the people are going to pay for the tickets are so it's not going to be a fly by not going to be they send in a quick survey is going to be real sincere engagement\nWith the community about how we build this fall at this point\nHow much is I'm with you know and interrelated with you\nA very closely so through the ah interviews for both the on this project manager as well as the um architect\nIt was the city team that was in there and it was looking you know it was January Smith it was most of their key staff who sat there for two solid days or they you know it was probably sixteen Eighteen hours or more of listening to the presentations asking questions\nYou know kind of clarifying thanks so they're putting a lot of time and as\nThey are here in a very you know engaged to a matter of fact I was telling Paul I talked to Larry over the phone over the weekend and about the pros and cons of a couple of the\nArtist and he was going following up having coffee with a couple of them that have a studios in the Boston area to see this studio see what they look like kind of get a feel for them so um this is something we're going to do that to do right\nRight right\n[laughter] that we work as a team and we have common interests here or to make this\nBe the best it can be for the neighborhood we need it it's more than just a ballpark is the manager said this is part of the neighborhood we want people to go eat lunch sitting around there we want to make it to be like a um\nLarry Latino likes to say minor league ballparks apart amusement park we want playgrounds we want things around get to keep it alive even when there's\nNothing going on in the end we want the public to be able to walk the concourse uh [noise]\nYou know most may minor league ball price one of the architects said you know depends varies a little bit about three times around the concourse as a mile and people can go there and at lunchtime do their three laps or something like that we wanted to be part of it in the neighborhood not just locked up other than that one is an event\nThat that's why I think it's so exciting yeah yeah it really is and you know the whisker element to it you've got the inside of the car costs will have your traditional food vendors but the outside that with the\nThe field as the backdrop I saw this down in Nashville they had all campers and trucks that hollowed out and they have special the food vendors operating out of there we've talked about doing that with Mr diners\nSo having the old Mr diners that have the names on it throughout the conquest and you can get a specialty food item at you know\nI'm just filling in days the boulevard does\nYou know the parkway or whatever it may be along the concourse overlooking the ballparks or fields\nAgain like ... or the old adage I'm pretty sure they were all may exactly they were made here and there are a big part of our neighborhoods out big part of our history so kind of a paying tribute to them and integrating them into this new modern facility now she got\nSo one of the big thing is that and I want to call that come in and talk a little bit about is integrated planning which is far less sexy or than building a new ballpark um but very germane to the pocket books of the people of oyster or\nWhether they be uh you know property owners themselves or rent just somebody's paying a water through a bill or if you live in the city of ... or or you or a business operating in the city of wish to somebody's paying the city of West or a water sewer bell\nAnd you know we've worked really hard and before I got here uh Paul and his of previous boss Bob Boilen and Michael Brian and others\nReally led the charge to try to fight 'em some of the the about permitting um requirements that were being handed down from the EPA\nOr as unworkable or in terms of the costs that they were gonna um past have to pass onto the rate payers in the city of Worcester we all share the goal of wanting a clean environment we want you know\nTo make sure we're doing our fair share to make sure that what we put back into other rivers and streams of of Massachusetts is as clean as it has to be but we don't want to be chasing you know I'm unrealistic goals\nUh when we can be doing other things that will have a bigger impact on the quality of the environment so\nNow we've been able to convince the EPA do allow us to try this integrated plan approach um\nWhich has led us make the case to the EPA that we can\nYou know accomplish some very important um goals in terms of the environment but doing it in a more affordable way and do it in a longer term way a and it gets a fifty year plus plans\nOr that we really need the public to validate through a public process and we had one hearing willing to do another one on November race and we want to get the public kind of engage in this conversation because it's very germane to the people in the city [noise]\nYeah I joined in fact just give you a little background about two years ago now after two years of negotiating with a P. A. we got them to or I Will allow us to take this concept of an integrated plants and what that concept is is look you want us to spend a lot of money they want us to spend\nAbout a hundred and eighty to two hundred million more on the upper black some treatment plant after the two thousand for permanent we already spent two hundred million we said look we can't do that we challenge and call we eventually lost\nBut even after winning they finally realized that it might be worth a compromise because we said to them look if we have to do that we can't afford to do anything else you already did that to us once when we had to go from\nYou know I I saw a rates went up for a hundred percent in just a short period of time between two thousand and four and a few years ago now it's even more [noise] we said to them weren't all\nPick up our our water or sewer system the number pump stations\nThe um the sewer system and water systems probably Thirteen hundred miles a pipe\nI'm fully a third of its over a century old I'm On the suicide it's more than that the water side in better condition because even some of the old pipe say go back to the Eighteen hundreds but over the years they've been relying we'd been lining since back in the eighties so the water system generally terms of distribution of pipes\nAre between water into this forty to pump stations ah Worcester is a city of hills which requires all those pumps stations in different pressure systems we have ten reservoirs all I'll Try to\nThe city and there's a substantial number of dams and and you know infrastructure related to the resolution of course we got the filtration plant\nThere was built in response to when we used to have poor quality drinking water and now we have some of the best in New England but that is Twenty years old and we're having a stack\nYeah twenty is um we're right now doing the ozone system over because not serviceable anymore and you know over the next decade or two and a half to upgrade parts that\nI'm wrong and we didn't have potable water we couldn't put water on airplanes yeah right it didn't pass was founded on this and that's what we did the water filtration\nYeah we were the brunt of jokes back then I mean that was unnecessary expenditures that's still paying dividends to the community that we have reliable safe drinking water is\nOne of the things they say you you it's one of the things you have the luxury of taken for granted in Worcester you put the cap on you don't think twice about it just go or they've been documentaries and stuff written about Flint, Michigan or you look at what it's like to try to sell your house in Flint, Michigan\nTalking about economic development there is none when you don't have water that people feel it's safe to drink\nOh my God nothing else ... nothing else can ... what is it ...\nIt was one issue but I remember when I Wish there\nWere ... I mean to a fairy shrimp and we ought to know I'm the only work\nAh actually these little micro swimming around in your water clash I mean you know and I mean you went through the city you know what you have the drinking and also it it didn't pass federal standards that we didn't want to spend the money we were fighting with each other so it's like\nA it was probably one of the best things we ever did this huge and then the ... that I Know we worked with clock universities that time is there some studies with the city of Worcester and conscious I wished year public works at that time when we started the whole reminding from um now was a big step forward\nAnd we're actually still doing it but all the major pipes had done but we're still doing probably for a million a year in in New Maine's in in ... in an amazing process in the water but that\nThat a filtration plant we knew at the time was the right thing to do is a big investment but it it's paid dividends all these years and will continue to pay dividends because we can't attract economic expansion without reliable safe water and ...\nAnd you think about who some of our biggest customers are the people who employ a lot of folks polar beverage ...
