B. any book offers dot com I'm giving away free copies of the book to celebrate the anniversary\nI talk about in the book\nSome of the reasons why people tend to avoid\nThe audiologist avoid their hearing healthcare and you just you just sort of hit the nail on the head unfortunately as soon as you turn sixty or sixty two you get ... with junk in the mail\nAbout by this widget fifty percent off this would you buy one get one\nAnd so there's a very strong retail arm there's up hey there's a lot of money to be made\nBecause forty million people live with untreated hearing loss and the approach for most of these companies is well my which it is better right and so uh not enough people people some people in our community offer me receiving letters that talks about the importance of hearing healthcare right that's our message\nForget the ... we don't even work with traditional hearing aids because they don't work and every one of your listeners know somebody who spent too much money on traditional hearing it they do not work they do not treat the cognitive aspects of hearing loss which is what our neuro technology does\nAnd our patient speak to what we did a blind study that showed a Ninety seven percent patient satisfaction rating so I think there's just this\nReputation that is hard to lick but I Know that we are breaking through I Know our message is resonating with people because I Believe it's one of the ultimate fears for many of us\nIs cognitive decline is the statistic that you can physically live on this planet for ten years without cognitively being there that's how scary dimension is that most people just\nThey lose it they lose the ability to communicate to to hold relationships and it's really sad and and it could be avoidable\nYeah you know ... there's not only that person involved here and just a it's the family is the caregiver or the children\nKnow dementia costs the average family fifty seven thousand dollars a year to care for a loved one\nThirty five out of every one hundred people diagnosed with dementia could have been prevented\nAnd I tried to tell people all the time filled the studio with a hundred people that all have dementia thirty five of them didn't have to be here and so this is talk that we're doing on October sixteen is all about ways to live a happy healthy active lifestyle and we're going to review some of

of that um you're not hearing will I mean I went ahead my hearing test that will fall but sure I had my hearing tested with you um\nAnd I had no idea that I had some hearing loss um\nI think it starts with accepting the fact that every mammal on this planet\nIs going to have hearing loss as they should just an aging at ... there's no ... and you know exactly and you also have to a ... in my organs changing everything changes right and you also have to accept that there is no such thing as quote unquote normal age related hearing loss\nYou either have normal hearing or you have a hearing loss\nAnd once you have for your loss you are at risk for a number of other\nSignificant medical disorders including\nDiabetes thyroid disease cognitive decline memory loss I mean the list goes on and on hearing well are ... some correlation ... there is some conduct are there some are known some are not known some are still theories but\nBut the data is there the statistics are overwhelming about how important hearing healthcare is your overall physical and mental wellbeing\nAmazing thing I mean and that's when I think the average person's ... come\nDiabetes from 'cause I Can't hear well the

I don't mean the negative side of things I mean the negatives when it comes time to polling not a big believer in polling but I I Do look at the negative so\nWhen Donald Trump's negatives would be forty eight percent Hillary Clinton's negatives were or save ... negative uh forty two percent ... percent\nIt's not rocket science for me to understand that she's not getting elected\nOr you don't get elected with forty eight percent negatives even though she won't wait a minute she had fifty two percent positive yeah because at that time that means every positive voted has to vote\nOr when you're already running that high in negative or you can pretty well guarantee that you're not going to get unless you're running us another candidate has high negative and that's what happened in the lab some actual between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump they both had high negatives\nAnd there were ... or you know just Trump was smart enough to you know get the ... votes in the states that he knew that he could win so we concentrated in the backbone of America and\nThat's when he was able to pull missing off so I'm so we'll see what this thing goes in whether they come up with anything and whether there's I'm\nNow a\nTrump has not been a interviews and he's not going to be a he'd have to be at the end full to get in there and I'll be interviewed by now you say Jay he's telling the truth why what he\nWell have you ever wish Donald Trump emotional talk I mean for him\nTo hold a a subject matter beyond thirty seconds and knocked off another tangent and then go back and say things in a much different vein\nUm they'd have him on line\nOr perjury in about five seconds so messy you want to do with Donald Trump of ours on oil is sent me the questions that will give you an answer is still the president not estates and unless they have something where the smoking gun to it is still a pretty well insulated in a protected\nAnd that kind of a capacity and um so we'll see what this thing goes and the\nOther interesting thing that I found was a comment yesterday by the federal of\nA federal bank\nFederal Reserve chairman I'm Jerome Powell there's not a household word yet but he will be after each there for a while I'm\nUsing the word remarkable when he's talked about the economy\nA these are very reserved people no pun intended with the Federal Reserve but these bankers are very careful what they say that the stock market rises and falls on a simple word\nOr they raise interest rates and they raised interest rates because the economy is going strong and they raise interest rates to control inflation but\nTo use the word remarkably positive outlook it has blown the top off the stock market\nNow Trump gets blamed for a lot\nBut what you have the Federal Reserve chairman or making comments that the pawn them a remarkably as a positive outlook and that the U.S economy is enjoying both low unemployment and low inflation\nUm\nHe said it's almost too good to be true how do you beat a guy like that when we vote our pocketbooks we give us a lot of other things I don't like him I don't like is really talks\nI teach crude I think he's really\nWell let me tell you what it comes down to push shove most of us for our pocketbooks is that's the part where the federal government impacts us the most damage too\nYou have in our pocket how much do we have an ... what's the quality of life there will be for me and my retirement\nHome I show how am I going to pay for my children to go to college these are the kinds of things and the bread and butter sandwich\nMeat and potatoes meat and potatoes ... all the time overall this flamboyant city so I still think that when it comes to push shove people won't tell you that which Trump but if they have more money in the pocket of the year before and they're up there for one fake Moran is that it did before\nHe's been Jordan let me show on who wouldn't want to be in public office today if you're a man or woman of more sort of [noise] I mean Jesus Christ was he just nominate and unless it's just for fun Youth Radio five eighty ...
