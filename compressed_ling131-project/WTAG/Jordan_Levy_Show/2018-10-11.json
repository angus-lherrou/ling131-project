Clintons to talk about civility\nUh I mean Bill Clinton is handled himself in a much more civil way than Hillary Hillary down and dirty nasty um but yesterday in the middle of this terrible harvesting going on in Florida the governor of the of the state is running for United States Senate but he's governor\nSo he's doing what he has to do as governor trying to save people's lives Rick Scott I don't

for working together to ... to making sure the people in Florida are safe no but he just said that he could just walk away from it [noise]\nYou have to walk 'em the rain like they have to hide all

was a ... problem which is awful version doesn't he's not a toy which were you know early with us talk about the Russian well yeah what's going on ...\nI Know summer was a little busy and um you know but here we are now we've got a lot going on down at the shelter and we have\nI'm going to say Thirteen dogs up for adoption or maybe maybe just a lot less than that um if you were adopted this week but there are a bit bigger um we have a lot of we have a few bigger dogs and they're really great there's a variety from your you know rambunctious teenagers to your laid back older ones\nAnd we have a really shy Chihuahua right now to who's who's really um\nYou know needs needs a person to call her own and she'll be fine\nAnd we have a few cats I went up for adoption we have a big and this rabbit named pumpkin is probably bigger than every single cat we have and that was her one yeah he's he's he's huge he's like a um sort of French ... it's a it's a oh gosh uh one of the biggest ones to Fleming\nGiants I think it is it's a massive rabbit huge and of course his name's pumpkin 'cause we are very festive with our names and we have a few guinea pigs and two ...\nTwo journals yeah charges lowest of the road road rage and everything\nYeah to a terrible so those are the animals we have up for adoption um and like we've shared their all speed or neutered current with their vaccines and ready to go home and and one of the neediest dogs we've had some of these dogs for a while it's been with us through really the spring and summer\nBut there's one whose name is ... and if you look at a picture on line you know she kind of takes you back for a second because she has no far\nAnd it's not intentional she's dealing with um skin allergies and insensitivity ... yes but to both like food and environmental engineering was so neglected\nThrough her care that you know really all of our heritage is falling out so we have our own special bath special food a little medication to support her immune system\nBut she kind of just looks so they get back for a second because she just looks itchy\nComing back and it's a little we feel like we're seeing a couple of tough but um she's an adult dog she's like a you know one of those\nAbout George ... yeah she had ... years in and then I'm just an autoimmune disease yeah people have right now but they're not pretty no um\nYou know and that's what unfortunately with the animals sometimes looks new cell yeah and so we looked at her and go oh I don't I don't know about that that looks weird that was different um but she's a really sweet girl she's just she's under two years old and um and she's she's a love she really is a lot of her name's now law\nI'm and we're taking care of her but we want we want her to find a foster home because we know she's going to be here for a while\nYou know just going through care so she's really sweet girl the closest allies are the\nChances that only the right person will come along the ... they will yeah I mean there are dogs ... as you know there were ... dogs that have no\nRight and that's why I said this is an unintentional hairless dog it's not one of them it's you know she should have hair it'll be interesting to see what color is she as once it does go back because right now she's this grayish pink color like her skin is so um but she certainly still in our hearts\nNo you know just in in a young the right person that can be on seeing the uh obvious that she's here almost and get to know ... and so you put a coat on her when she goes out\nOf a little trouble with his his ... and no one's really care as long as she's nicely animal yes you could\nBe great companion to someone that just wants a nice she really wanted him most were sort of show dogs you know most was how much so yeah and we're better off you know not having a solution pure breeds yeah you have all these problems\nRight right right oh it looks aren't everything she's got the personality was really does she's a sweetheart so ... yeah she had been with us as long as some of them but I think that she she would be in that category because of her looks in her needs you know they are kind of substantial and there are different\nAnd so we um are highlighting her 'cause she's a special girl good yeah\nSo ... is a Robin Hood river the rubber\nMats on the been with us for a couple of weeks a I think just about a week or so we saw the new to him because we knew to all of our our rabbits is rabbits do what they do and we don't need to do it [laughter] I'm rabbits are actually one of the most popular animals in an animal shelter and it's because people don't I'm\nKind of have a different expectations they their their life span as much longer than what most people think it can be up to fourteen years old and so you think you kind of get the pocket pet that deliver a couple of years while the kids are in middle school or high school whatever but it can you know and they're very smart\nAnd they're in in their other social animals so they can be litter box trained and they love to play with toys they left to show affection but if they're not spit or neutered just like the rest of most bases\nI'm there at a higher risk for different illnesses and cancers and then they're also their behavior can be a little scary because all those hormones are gone um you know have always\nBeen around for the ... that he was a little screwed ... soon yeah we do is change the dynamic supposed with your job yeah yeah yeah I've had friends who've had rabbits and I didn't know it didn't ... it was a long\nLifespan can be yeah it is it's almost it's relative to a cat and it's on you know definitely all pets or commitment and our responsibility but I think you know that there's that unexpected lifespan that can
