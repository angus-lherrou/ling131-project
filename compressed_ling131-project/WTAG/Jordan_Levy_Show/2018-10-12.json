Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handles Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing\nThe president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys and I shut and all and I should have known Geraldo\nTold Trump to get Kanye West in there and Joe Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you don't get her into did bring up a or something I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted\nBlacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave and they go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane and\nBush was responsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up but it was Kanye West

this why did you were being ... the ABC exclusive\nEvent don't miss it tonight at ten nine central on ABC\nBy the way getting out of here and one of ... what a welcome back [noise] everybody in Panama City that is able to listen to the radio they being at work [noise] utilized a helicopter\nAnd satellite dish to get the broadcast tower and facilities of our Panama City affiliate back up and running all ready that's W F L F F am Ninety four points five and it's great to have them all ready back\nTo a hundred and thirty two thousand nine hundred from a hundred and twenty eight thousand four hundred\nEarners out so what happens now just to explain to you that\nWhen you work and if you make a hundred and twenty eight thousand four hundred dollars on the first hundred and twenty thousand four hundred dollars you pay Social Security\nTaxes [noise] and after a hundred and twenty thousand four hundred yeah nuts apps and Social Security I don't know why after all these years he's talking about the solvency of Social Security tax why Social Security isn't taking out for all of your earnings\nI mean instead of you know I guess as well be taxing the rich but you make money to pay more but if it's it it's all within the graduation so um I mean I'd be in favor of Social Security taxes going all the way up\nUm and then you've got to get it back you live long enough\nYou see they take the tax out but it's like the government saving for you so when they give me something that really not give me any given me a little bit of my money back\nAnd the whole program was predicated on people dying before they were sixty five years old or sixty two years old now they raise the age to sixty seven years old I guess well I was all predicated on us not loving long enough to get any benefits\nAnd most of us will not live long enough to be able to get the benefits I'm a total amount of money that we've paid in over the years\nSo it was a calculation\nYou know of of how long people live and how much do they pay out\nSo a little bit it's a little bit [noise] um so people now that\nAre going to be making over a hundred and twenty eight thousand for up to a hundred and thirty two thousand\nA that's a three and a half percent increase earning that new threshold will wind up paying an additional two hundred and Seventy nine dollars in taxes and their employees will pay the same Social Security\nIs paid for by you work in an equal amount by your employer government workers don't pay Social Security they have their own government\n\nRetirement funds that are not funded by anybody except the taxpayers so if you work for the state or the city or the federal government you don't pay any Social Security taxes although that was supposed to change and um that everyone was supposed to be on the same program but it hasn't\nUm the cost of living adjustment based on a formula that reflects changes in consumer prices will be alive just from the monthly payments since three point six percent in two thousand twelve\n\nOr this year the increase was two percent so you're a tenth of one percent more I don't know what I'm going to do it all but I mean gasoline\nWent from two dollars and Ninety cents a gallon this time last year the two Seventy nine that yeah and that sixty cents a gallon so not even that won't even pay for my gas increase I see where they take hours food and in in a fuel heating oil is up twenty percent\nYeah heating oil prices are up twenty percent this year so you live in the north east with the predominant so heating oil is your cost of going up twenty percent your gas costs a natural gas costs have gone up about I think seven or eight percent\nNothing's going down you notice that nothing is going down everything's going up because of your pay 'em a kind of stays the same\n\nBecause we can that Bernie in the air and that's the very end Medicare for all\nShow um two thousand sixteen the increase was three tenths of one percent [noise] that was in two thousand Seventy and two thousand sixty\nI'm\nSamantha can't went up into a thousand sixty in two thousand seven the Social Security didn't go up so actually you lost money\n\nActually lost but now if you pay Social Security and war Iraq is still worth is how it works out\nI work and I pay Social Security taxes on every dime I alright I pay my Social Security taxes and then I'm taxed on that\nThen I hit my Social Security that\nWas my money that I paid in\nAnd the government hasn't given me and the interest on it they're just held at all these years\nAll right\nSo they've held that money on these years not give me any money on it and now comes to a situation where um\nMy\nSo I I work I pay Social Security taxes and I have to be committed that income on my income taxes\nAll right I get my security Social Security check and I have to declare that as income and so do you if you are a file your taxes and they kept me on my Social Security that I receive\nAnd they say well that's because the Social Security money is taken out pre tax money\nBut you had my buddy I started paying Social Security when I was for the most so for sixty one years they have had my money and they've given me zero interest zero interest for sixty one years\n\nI think I pay my dues inequities are amazing how it it it it it kind of always ... kind of shocks me that the Democrats specifically because they're the party give give give\nA has not come up with that that whole revisionist up a process dealing with Social Security it's not difficult to explain that to people I'm not suggesting that are that we are\nI'm suggesting you'd take Social Security all the way up to make two million dollars a year continue pay your Social Security taxes on on a ... dollar well you're just like everybody else does this no cut off\nThere is no official coming up with a hundred and thirty nine thousand or a hundred and twenty eight thousand whatever it was there is no cut off\nJust to just pay\nSome surprising that Democrats haven't come up with this idea and I 'cause they keep on telling you a bit of Social Security's insolvent ... Social Security's ... solvent than the United states of America as well where is all but we can't pay our debt\nWe own what ten trillion billion dollars we can't pay it matched by China's threatening us right now they're not going to buy debt\nNot gonna buy treasuries\nSo that's how this works out let's talk to a day by day\nBy the\nWay they are the are already I wore long enough yet my body\n... or whatever they call it now call buddy quiet but anyhow ten years\nSo I\nDo whatever the people I work in a way\nThat I got a job when they retire\nAnd I'm not complaining and I'm doing fine but I ate in [noise] and now we're getting quality of what I ran but they're not given me back\n[laughter] that extra day eight in the Korean War\nAnd when I was at what point did you stop paying Social Security taxes\nOh probably about Seventy [noise] oh\nSo the majority of your working life you were not in the Social Security system\nBut I had enough\nYou know I understand you had enough to become a but she never write too much about how much money since Nineteen Seventy six you up and pay the diamonds or Social Security\nLaw that yeah yeah well you know you haven't painted\nBy a doll while they only that but I Want him out\nYou know I understand but five Seventy six to two thousand they teen you'd pay a dime to Social Security\nNo but I I got from wind I work for I'm only getting friday\nAnd that's the best of Massachusetts deal and that now that\nThey do it\nWell but there's a Massachusetts thing that people don't get their Social Security and it's a\n... theme\nHere I'm Talking about not talking about your your uh your state pension\nRight I get my\nWhen they punish you yeah\nAnd and go why you're talking about Massachusetts it's called so ironic it's called the windfall\nLaw that's right now I don't know I had my\nDefinition of windfall but the last I knew working decades to put money into that system\nYou know you can get your forty quarters you get the full amount you're\nEntitled to is not a windfall that cold hard work\nYeah and how 'bout how 'bout going to the other way no how 'bout working um and uh your whole life and then you continue to work after you get your Social Security okay um and then because you earn money\nOr they take away some of your uh they increase your Medicare or cost so I get punished because I continue to work\nInstead of sitting on my ass at home I I don't know\nI was wondering why the government wants to curtail people even after ...\nYou know I don't yeah sure I get my suit your abs for other people why should I get my Social Security\nAnd then they increased my Medicare costs each year because I earn money but they take taxes out of it\nThey were taking money from their county your account factors there\nActually I saw the recount now you worked as a cop for all those years you've paid your dues you pay your pension you got your pension then you go out and you work I don't know what to defer should be you know if he didn't work with if you if you were in the public sector and you didn't work in a private sector I get it you're not eligible for Social Security I got it\nYou've got your pension that shit okay but if we were on both sides you should not be punished if you pay your dues on both ends\n... the amount that you could get from then regardless of what you have elsewhere shouldn't get paid how much you get when you're paying the full vote like everybody right but to say\nThat not only that social sitting by the people realize that they're not OK Social Security and that and that was never meant for people to retire on show\nWe on that you know the income no it was meant as a supplement I go out\nAnd I get my supplement in the state of Massachusetts says thank you very much but we're not going to let you have that\nAnd I go out to get my supplement and they raised my Medicare costs yeah and they check everything away on my Social Security and punish me for\nThe first time concern after you attain whatever rage you retire and qualify to get your Social Security I don't think they should be taxing\nOn ... and I didn't take Social Security until I was\n... at the age of a big difference whether I took it and I said I waited till I sixty seven years old\n... well see I I'm going to be sixty five and may yeah uh I haven't put in the mind yet I but I have to check in with the telomeres I'm good for about five hundred and fifty dollars a month which is basically what it's going to cost me for the Medicare\nAnd this was going to talk to my medication which is like ... people say why do you work a lot of like 'cause I'm going to eat\nThat instead of being able to get a you know they're being fourteen hundred whatever it might have been\nYou know it just just wrong it's just totally wrong the systems wrong is regressive it's not fair and it was never bankruptcy shouldn't be bankrupt his bank records they stole our money and they didn't want to make the hell with\nHarry publishes and tell them they better revamp the definition of the word windfall\nWindfall that's Massachusetts great tax windfall tax you weren't all your life with your life on the line you get a windfall hell of a weird for me to use it when I could hold here in ... skip down the road with the wind falls yeah you got it made All right brother take care of our mind and hold on we'll take you after we break\n[noise]\nThis is Jordan let me show and I've never seen so much excitement as this as I have seen over the top of the worst the red Sox won use

W E a G China when Ninety three when I saw over the place here which the news weather in traffic station five away children's ... we've been talking Social Security\nWas taught to Bob Hi, Bob oh no his first right yeah yeah sorry in\nAnd say okay you know what I said at the beginning ... a month no I'm ...\nI'm not getting that way I mean\nLike you get a lot more than I can sell you might get ... dollars but I Want you\nKnow we can always find is that the average the average of all people that receive Social Security yeah average the average increase this week\nI ended up going to get more but I don't know when I ... you know last time I got four dollars yeah well he got ...\n... how much Social Security you get on line a month and then they\nTake out that Medicare\nOh yes yeah but they're not going to ask but that they say they're not increasing Medicare and not not that is what they're saying they're not going to increase Medicare and you're and you're going to get two point eight percent more or in your chest and you're getting now\nOh God it's not going to be a lot you know I Know that much better than nothing you know I'm going to handle gonna\nSo it it it is my thinking correct that if they did pay into Social Security there'd be some a perception or level of double dipping in there where the tax payers joined the money pay the taxes we pay their salaries which then they pay Social Security out up into Social Security\nI'd be in favor of doing away with the private pensions government pensions and only have the Social Security system\nWell so there's certainly if you know I haven't done this\nBut I'm the only new employees all new employees were hired on a certain day\nWould be if they would have to participate in Social Security system that we are supposed to do and they would boil unfunded pension liability at the federal government has in the billions and billions and billions of dollars and sort of a city or town\nThe ... the unfunded pension liabilities or would it would just catastrophic wipe out citizen towns Massachusetts or the country\nSo I don't want to double jeopardy I Want people to have one one way or the other but if you if you have a system right now we have a federal pension system and you pay in and then you stop being a federal employee you go into the private sector\nAnd you pay a forty corners and whatever you're eligible foreign total income you should be eligible for but but if you if your income and that forty corners is not at that level you're not going to be getting what I'm getting because I didn't have a ... a pension other than Social Security is really not a pension but it's a subsidy\nSo I don't want people to be able to take it on both ends unless they're paying out of both ends\nYep well there are a lot of common failed sent built built into that same uh and uh it would be nice if that would prevail more uh but anyway thank you very much for taking my call Jordan\nThanks for
