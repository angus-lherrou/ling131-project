Donohue the congressman as a kid just a little kid my only point you're just means our congressman Harold Donahue\nMy God I mean I was so impressed when a congressman\nToday I mean you just read these stories every day in a in a national newspapers or online about using liars and they lie to your face on a daily basis I don't care what part of your rent\nYou know it in and then return to office\nYou know it it's a what do you do for me lately how much can you bring me back\nSo it's our fault we we've set the boss sold them all the expectations for running for public office who runs for public office today is uh at the national level what could the quality of those people and we have what we used to have her on\nThe education the honesty the integrity oh we can disagree with them\nBut my right to your face today they I mean it's so bad that there are there are new sources uh ... how ... how many noses do they put on your how long have you know it was ... when they were they validate how how many times you buy\nI mean you see it every day I scratch my head and amazement I said I just hear him say that I just hear her say that they've got\nTapes of some of these people that didn't they didn't know there will be in type ... the worst invention for politicians that ever happened was this 'cause they get pictures\nAnd they get tapes this is the worst invention of a politician's\nAll right so is this ... I mean it's just like Barack Obama when he said the men of it or in Russia um oh just tell them as soon as the election's over you know 'cause I won't be able to run again we can take care of that and that's what we're talking about with this Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union collapsed\nAnd then this whole situation about our show with NATO and then also about happiness nuclear weapons that we were all going to have a treaty\nWell what happened I'm central didn't make the world safer the fall of the Soviet Union did that\nYou know control we're actually countries got 'em all that's where your trust each other\nBut you can't tell anybody that you can trust Russia Russia doesn't trust us you can't trust China so who do you trust\n\nNow Moscow started this in two thousand fourteen and check this out a papal please check it out for me bronco bomber was in the White House\nAnd they went public with the news in two thousand fourteen that the state department is noted that Russia's noncompliance every few dollars for the Obama administration Russia was in compliance with the treaty\nThe nuclear treaty and what we do about two thousand fourteen Fifteen sixteen Seventy an hour in two thousand eighty\n\nWell during President Obama's last term as a a ... year in office he he knew that a Russian was or not in compliance and they started deploying new missiles\nAnd two thousand sixteen Trump Washington the White House in two thousand sixty Obama was what did they do about it was the secretary states do about it\nWas just a very defense do about I mean we really pass easier\n\nIf we spent much time do you pay attention to this as we do investigating collusion\nAs much as ... as much money we wouldn't let them get away with this show when I first read that Trump was going to do this whole thing with the trip so why not just guys crazy we're going to be this nuclear race that they simply not playing\nRussia's already doing is they're already deploying these missiles and been don't point them since two thousand and fourteen\nAnd we're sitting on our behinds just watching that happened that also develop a new ballistic missile that Russia's tested\nSo all we ever going to do anything about it\n\nOn the diplomatic impulse is to keep quiet about violations and we're up behind the scenes people say All right we're two thousand forty fifty and that's two years sixty three years seven genes for ya how quiet you want to be\nWhy enemy that wants to destroy you is building a weapon weaponization process and violation of a treaty that you had that's going to put us as a second rate nation\n\nIf you can watch the power Putin's getting up how Putin won missiles ... missile I don't want us to get into a a a a a another a race arms race I don't want us to go there so that way you make sure you don't have to go there is your top you now\nYou call 'em out right on the floor of the United Nations Security council\nYou're bringing out the open you take take down the shower\nUh I applaud him for coming out with it and not hiding it but at the same time or if you're going to win this fight you can't win on your own right and so I agree with you Paul that up there was a better way to do it it's not who he is and that doesn't bode well for us all over the long term he'd write\nOne question join yes one of the the questions I wanted to bring up a originally was you honestly believe that there's going to be a tend to think tax cut across the board within a week for the middle class people absolutely not\nWell those are the kind of thing that it does me off I Hope that the right word to use\nWithout being too offensive about this guy you know I I I very thrilled with many of the legislation that isn't that the judge that he pick and everything but when he said things like that\nMaybe you got a lot of other people pay close attention to judge write it up but there are people actually must pay attention to that and say wow great that's good news\nAnd I think that's a very unfair him to say things like\nThat you had on and that's the problem that I Try to raise before maybe as in says to me as you did but is it there there's just outright my eyes are outright lies by him there's outright lies by Democrats on a running off the United States Senate right now that are running for president\nSaying why write a book you write in a debate and they lie that and I am so happy to be an independent\nAnd uh you know I Am too in a in a it was the best thing I ever did and they actually look at you and they lied [laughter] no and I but and then the next day they say it's like it never happened\nThat's when I was saying before pom that's right caliber of people that we now have in public office is embarrassing it is it's a really outliers in both sides of the aisle\nAbsolutely absolutely appreciate the call Paul thanks\nAnd that's sad because trust we have to have someone show is the ... the lowest common denominator of mind I mean do we have to I battalion folks you offered me we can only get so much how much on these people what's a red light\nAnd every time they deny that red bell goes off\nThat should be a criteria maybe a constitutional amendment anybody running for public office or anybody in public office and any time if they speak they have to be wearing a red element\nWhich I Am I bowl\nAnd every time they open them out above will go offers any lie constantly\nThey'll do anything now selling that first born to get elected was going to say say don't steal cheat lie\n\n... gosh that\nWas this
