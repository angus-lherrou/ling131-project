y'all [noise] if you're white senior plenty on campus and you don't fill in the line and you're ostracized if every group that margin alive because not allowed to come for the college so I think that's where it stems from\nOr whether you go to college but that why do you ... to go into that college that I I think it's all colleges and so it's not all colleges are all colleges that don't have like after ... ... you know there are other\nColleges that don't have no way I mean there are some that are more radical than others or would you would you spend all your money going to get an

and we even if you go off you but you know you have a tough time\nWell I understand that but that's why I think people selectively you have to decide whether ... whether they want to go to college or not\nYeah they shouldn't have college philosophy will change when the money ... dries up and benefactors on giving the money for as long as colleges like Harvard University having a job and fun when they got nine trillion dollars in New money\nAnd the Boston Globe has a ... a story today that that that tells you the power of of a hobby universities money that they have in their endowment\nOut there um how they could go out they could buy cities\nNow as long as that's out there than um I don't know how you find it but they have it's out there and we shouldn't just sit around and let these
