that brand keys golf club [noise]\nThis is ... speaks out news radio five eighty or Ninety four point nine ... double duty AG ... news weather and traffic station [noise]\nWelcome to Worcester speaks out very special guests in the studio today I have a Paul Richard and Fred Kaplan from the shrine initiative Hi guys the morning how are you going to be here uh Paul tell us what you uh do what is your position\nI'm the executive director of the shining initiatives and has had that deposition proudly since two thousand eleven\nAnd you've read I'm the executive director elect so I'll be taking the baton from Paul here and a couple of months where\nYou are going through a transition phase I I'm retiring from the position of the shining an issue but not retiring from life there you go that's a good thing right certainly hope so [laughter]\n[noise] All right so tell us a tell us about the shining initiative give us a little bit of history on the program what it does how long it's been around how it started\nEt cetera um we all are genesis to the um\nTo fidelity bank they're directors employees back in two thousand four one to dedicate a lot of their corporate charity to a cause that had little public recognition support and ah so the Shannon issue that was created they settled on the topic of mental health and mental illness\nAnd for the first several years we really devoted ourselves to ah just raising money and a ... a foundation so that we could go out and create some impact\nOr so for the first several years Tony ah we we really operated under the guise of an advisory board\nBut it was really about seven or eight years ago that we began to focus on child and adolescent mental health\nKnowing that half of lifetime cases begin by age fourteen and and because of the stigma because of the lack of true understanding recognition conversation we thought the best approach would be just simply begin to engage people in conversation and explaining what mental illness is and what it isn't\nA and I should point out that no one on our staff as a clinician\nBut we are all people who have either lived experience directly or through family members of loved ones and ah so the conversation is really non threatening his very mainstream in ... and that's been a successful approach for us\nSo your mission is to improve public awareness\nYeah we're really about combating the stigma a de stigmatizing mental health conditions in children and young adults and by doing that we of necessity engage um the adults who care for them so parents guardians teachers coaches mentors uh so it's all encompassing what is the stigma\nThe stigma really is lack of at the true definition is um ... an unfair set of beliefs based upon um\nAgain lack of of knowledge or so in in our society we have we have really not devoted ourselves to truly understanding what mental illness is what are rich causes what are the signs and symptoms that it is an illness just as diabetes is an illness cancers an illness um\nLung disease is an illness um and we don't shy away from talking about those or seeking treatment and and understanding or how to prevent it but with mental illness um we've always stepped away from that and that is only feel the stigma but we're breaking down those barriers now\nWhat are we doing for people who may feel that they ah have\nSome type of mental illness ah but they're afraid to talk about if they are afraid to you know if they talk about it I'll lose my job people think I'm Crazy sure I mean that's that's probably the the biggest a stigma out there is that um if you have a mental illness or you're crazy\nAnd that's not true of mental illness comes in very different forms\nIt comes in very different forms and it's something that can be with proper care and treatment it can be managed um it does not need to reach the point of um a chronic level or debilitating and do we remind people number one\nAny illnesses just a piece of who you are it doesn't define who you are it should not limit your capabilities I'm among adults we find that yeah they fear being ostracized you mentioned at work\nOr people who fear that you know if anyone knows that you know I'm experiencing depression what will that do to my career\nBut we're finding that as we talk to young people about this\nThey come forward when we go into schools Sony and present to students whether it's in middle schools are high schools they come forward almost readily just self disclose they want to talk about this\nUm and that's a good thing and we remind them that they should talk to their parents about it as well because so many kids will tell us you know my parents don't understand what I'm going through a they don't know how to get help for me uh and so that prevents them from from the advancing [noise]\nUndefined fear chemical imbalances um a couple of things that are really debilitating\n[noise] ah to people who have a a mental illness in addition to depression\nAh and phobias what else is out there\nWill certainly or anxiety or something we see a great deal of um in our society and especially in young people [noise] um there's been an increase in anxiety disorders um you know we also see or things like eating disorders\nOr you know bipolar disorder or something that um people are becoming more and more aware of as well [noise]\nUh so yeah there's just there's a whole range and and I think um you know to to highlight some of Apollo was saying to\nYou know when you begin to parallel mental health with physical health you know those those comparisons really get people to sort of think about it differently um [noise] you know I have a number of of ah my sisters and also some friends who are teachers and you know in their classrooms\nThey know students who have allergies who have asthma who might have diabetes um they know first aid for physical things small cuts and things like that [noise]\nUm but mental health first aid or just being aware enough to also you know now about who in your classroom um you know just has a different range of mental wellness is something that you know isn't always is often not there\nSo learning disabilities could point to a mental illness\nRight absolutely just as often times um we've been very very quick and health care field to slap the um the label ADHD on kids so that they have you know a tension\nDeficit hyperactivity disorder and when in fact there may be other things at play that you know because the kid might be acting out to 'em or um again showing extreme um hyper activity that that is not necessarily caused\nA because of the brain malfunction it could be something that they've experienced that uh you know a\nThrough um environmental factors I mean we see so many young kids these days who are\nLiving in um families where a parent may be incarcerated or one or both parents have a an addiction or they are the kids are victims of or a witness to domestic abuse and violence and all of those things have a tremendous impact on emotional growth in brain growth\nAnd um you know that can manifest in in the child's behavior in a classroom or elsewhere\nWhat happens at home usually goes with them in the rest of their day whether it's at school whether it's at the playground whether it's at a you know the baseball team basketball team soccer team whatever it is a you may be able to notice as a coach noticed some form of a\nAggression that is not normal I mean there's normal aggression and then there's aggression that has really over the top um\nWell you know that reminds me of the very pointedly several years ago um and I've coached youth sports for many many years there was a parent who came to me and wanted to inform me that her son had been diagnosed with significant ADHD and I had seen signs in his behavior\nThe fact that she shared that with me\nAllowed me to develop a different approach to how I relate to this youngster was only seven or eight years of age and different coaching techniques and how to involve him in um in all of the team um\nExercises in drills and it was enormous value and but had she not share that with me I might have you know seeing him through a different lens\nBeing a sore loser is that um [noise]\n... how do you how do you describe it like how would you approach that if a parent came to you and said you know what\nI Want my child to be on this team I Want my child to play team sports because I think it's a good life lesson um but my child is a real sore loser how do how do you what would you advise I'm a coach or what would how would you handle that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Worcester Speaks Out", "city": "Worcester", "day": "14"}
