{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "The shine initiative Hi guys that morning how are you good to be here or Paul tell us what you uh do what is your position and the executive director of the shining initiative and have had that deposition proudly since two thousand eleven and you've read\nI'm the executive director elect so I'll be taking the baton from Paul here and a couple of months where are you going\nAre going through a transition phase I I'm retiring from the position of the shining an issue but not retiring from life\nThere you go that's a good thing right certainly hope so [laughter]\nAll right so tell us a tell us about the shining initiative give us a little bit of history on the program what it does how long it's been around how it started\nThat said or um we all are genesis to the um\nTo fidelity bank they're directors employees back in two thousand four one to dedicate a lot of their corporate charity to cause that had little public recognition support and ah so the Shannon issued which created they settled on the topic of mental health and mental illness\nAnd for the first several years we really devoted ourselves to ah just raising money and a ... a foundation so that we could go out and create some impact\nA show for the first several years Tony ah we we really operated under the guise of an advisory board\nBut it was really about seven or eight years ago that we began to focus on child and adolescent mental health\nKnowing that half of lifetime cases begin by age fourteen and and because of the stigma because of the lack of true understanding recognition conversation we thought the best approach would be to simply begin to engage people in conversation and explaining what mental illness is and what it isn't\nAnd I should point out that no one on our staff is a clinician\nA but we are all people who have either a lived experience directly or through family members or loved ones and uh so the conversation is really non threatening his very mainstream in ... and that's been a successful approach for us\nSo your mission is to improve public awareness\nYeah we're really about combating the stigma a de stigmatizing mental health conditions in children and young adults and by doing that we of necessity engage um the adults who care for them so parents guardians teachers coaches mentors or so it's all encompassing what is the stigma\nThe stigma really is lack of at the true definition is um an an unfair set of beliefs based upon um\nAgain lack of of knowledge or so\nIn in our society we have we have really not devoted ourselves to truly understanding what mental illness is what are rich causes what are the signs and symptoms that it is an illness just as diabetes is an illness cancers an illness um\nLung or diseases in illness um and we don't shy away from talking about those or seeking treatment and and understanding or how to prevent it but with mental illness um we've always stepped away from that are in that is only the oldest stigma but we're breaking down those barriers now\nWhat are we doing for people who may feel that they uh have\nSome type of mental illness um but they're afraid to talk about if they are afraid to you know if they talk about it I'll lose my job people think I'm Crazy show I mean that's that's probably the the biggest a stigma out there\nIs that um if you have a mental illness or you're crazy yeah and that's not true of mental illness comes in very different forums\nIt comes in very different forms and it's something that can be with proper care and treatment it can be managed um it does not need to reach the point of um a chronic level or ... and do we remind people number one\nAny illnesses just a piece of who you are it doesn't define who you are it should not limit your capabilities\nI'm among adults we find that yeah they fear being ostracized you mentioned at work\nOr people who fear that you know if anyone knows that you know I'm experiencing depression what will that do to my career\nBut we're finding that as we talk to young people about this\nThey come forward when we go into school Sony and present to students whether it's in middle school or high schools they come forward almost readily just self disclose they want to talk about this\nUm and that's a good thing and we remind them that they should talk to their parents about it as well because so many kids will tell us you know my parents don't understand what I'm going through a they don't know how to get help for me uh and so that prevents them from from the dancing\nUndefined fear chemical imbalances um couple of things that are really debilitating or two people who have a a mental illness in addition to depression\nAh and phobias what else is out there\nWill certainly a anxiety or something we see a great deal of um in our society and especially in young people [noise] um there's been an increase in anxiety disorders um you know we also see or things like eating disorders\nOr you know bipolar disorder or something that um people are becoming more and more aware of as well [noise] uh so yeah there's just a there's a whole range and and I think um you know to to highlight some of Apollo was saying to [noise]\nYou know when you begin to parallel mental health with physical health you know those those comparisons really get people to sort of think about it differently um [noise] you know I have a number of of uh my sisters and also some ah friends who are teachers and you know in their classrooms\nThey know students who have allergies who have asthma who might have the diabetes um they know first date for physical things small cuts and things like that\nUm but mental health first aid or just being aware enough to also you know now about who in your classroom um you know just has a different range of mental wellness is something that you know isn't always is often not they're learning disabilities could point to a mental illness\nRight absolutely just as often times um we've been very very quick and health care field to slap the um the label ADHD on kids said that they have you know a attention\nDeficit hyperactivity disorder and when in fact there may be other things at play that\nYou know because the kid might be acting out to 'em or um again showing extreme um hyper activity that that is not necessarily caused a because of the brain malfunction it could be something that they've experienced that uh you know a\nThrough um environmental factors I mean we see so many young kids these days who are living in um families where\nA parent may be incarcerated or one or both parents have a an addiction or they are the kids are victims of or a witness to domestic abuse and violence and all of those things have a tremendous impact on emotional growth in brain growth\nAnd um you know that can manifest in in the child's behavior in a classroom or elsewhere\nWhat happens at home usually goes with them in the rest of their day whether it's at school whether it's at the playground whether it's at a you know the baseball team basketball team soccer team whatever it is a you may be able to notice as a coach noticed some form of a [noise]\nAggression that is not normal I mean there's normal aggression and then there's aggression that has really over the top [noise] um\nWell you know that reminds me of the very poignantly several years ago um and I've coached youth sports for many many years there was a parent who came to me and wanted to inform me that her son had been diagnosed with significant ADHD and I had seen signs in his behavior\nThe fact that she shared that with me\nAllowed me to develop a different approach to how I relate to this youngster was only seven or eight years of age and different coaching techniques and how to involve him in um in all of the team um\nExercises in drills and it was enormous value in but had she not share that with me I might have you know seeing him through a different lens\nBeing a sore loser is that um [noise]\nWhat how do you how do you described that like how would you approach that if a parent came to you and said you know what I Want my child to be on this team I Want my child to play team sports because I think it's a good life lesson\nUm but my child is a real sort lose how do how do you what would you advise I'm a coach or what would how would you handle that\nHow well you know\nI I think directly over the thirty years that I've coached youth basketball in little league baseball and and a girls' softball that you know\nAs a coach I've always tried to emphasize both to the youngsters that I've coached a instructor but also in conversation with parents that the important thing here is that we are teaching them we're helping them to develop skills um and if you teach properly\nAnd and emphasize the skills but also the gamesmanship and the team work and the social and relational benefits that you get from involving yourself in sports\nWinning and losing is a non factor it becomes almost a non entity and it takes care of itself but if you have someone who is so so deeply enmeshed in the winning\nOr at all costs then you know I Would pull the parent decide and and ... suggest to them that perhaps it's time for them to seek some professional help on behalf of their child to seek out you know a counselor at the heavens talk this through haven't we may be other things you know beneath the surface\nHaven't we become part of the problem by giving everybody a trophy kind of thing so that nobody is quote unquote a loser everybody is a participant I'm and I think when you say that mental illness in children usually starts before the age of fourteen", "show_name": "Worcester Speaks Out",
