{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "Uh you might have been a maybe actively using drugs or alcohol and maybe you're in recovery now\nAh and this has been a chronic problem for a number of years he might be suffering from physical disability or medical problems or mental health issues are that's going to take some considerable time to help get you back on your feet\nAnd what is the uh what is the process if I'm uh in that\nList of of what you just told me about ... jobs in finances in recovery and physical disabilities or how does a veteran go about contacting you is there a application process that you just walk in the email what's that\nProcess like uh we have a program it's called coordinated entry and we work with the department of Veterans Affairs and our veterans are screened through the department of Veterans Affairs and us ourselves we do an assessment and we begin the process of trying to find out what the best to need is for you\nWe are done is a many many years ago coined the phrase called a triangle of needs in fact I'd let like to let him talk about that a little bit and he can tell you from a clinical standpoint how that works\nSo it's still a service correct we just tried to get some shape around the different issues that veterans were facing and and we realized that there were three main things that are veterans and their families were facing\nAnd those three things included a housing of course is probably one of the primary problems uh employment and the trainee related with that was another area and then the final area and probably the most complicated is a behavioral health and uh\nAnd you know all the things that go along with that including a person's a legal issues that they're facing [noise]\nAnd so when you look at those as the set of problems Tony the the the goal for then I was too slow to get our hands around how could we start to deliver services and each one of those categories\nAnd uh luckily we had great support from not only the community but also the federal government and great charitable foundations\nA list to log actually numerous eight um but I Will tell you that in in in a broad sense that the United States Department of labor\nAnd through the federal government or the department of Veterans Affairs became partners with us to help create a housing programs employment and training programs and then in the area of behavioral healthcare we've kinda gone down our own road to solve that problem which I can tell you about ...\n[noise] um behavioral health a correct me if I'm wrong it's not about\nPutting it I'm behind you a and\nTotally forgetting about it because there is from uh uh it's about dealing with a going forward right\nYeah that's exactly correct tone it and you know if you step back from this and just try and get a sense of what is the veterans and do we help people\nAnd that's a simple statement we help people\nThe complexity behind that statement do is what are we helping them with and so when you when you describe behavioral health the way that you just did tone that that's right on that's exactly it that you know these issues that some veterans and their families face\nThrough either the trauma that occurred when they're on military service or or or even more drastically lately the trauma that's occurred a\nAs a result of the mill is or military service in terms of the the um [noise] the substance addiction problems they develop um that truly becomes a lifelong condition that they are going to need to be on top of you know sad to say for the rest of their life\nThe structure in regimen that exists in the military once you are back home right\nIt's gone right so you have to decide what you're going to do with your day how you're going to plan your day uh\nWhat is most important about your day is it is it finding a place to live yeah is it finding a job or is it getting a health benefits to figure this all out like who's going to pay for this\nFrankly a fifty percent of our military now or in the guardsmen reserves\nAnd the way they work a it's a little different than it was twenty five thirty years ago when a ... a great majority of the military were career soldiers they went in fulltime and that was their job you know twenty four seven for four or five years at a time [noise]\nSo what happens now is that uh we have our young men and women who joined the national guard of the reserves and then a very short period of time they get deployed and a four or five period time sometimes as many as three or four times\nAnd if you think about in deployment Toby about a year to Eighteen months think of how often if you took yourself out of this career field your career field for a year or two a year and a half\nWent someplace with limited or communications came back stage for state here for about another year then did it all again then went away then came back and did it again we're kind of a network would you have how would you support structure break down this is what's happening to about fifty percent of the military\nTrue I'm In you know if we go back to uh nine eleven after nine eleven\nEverybody was signing up everybody was so patriotic everybody wanted to quote unquote get even yeah um and there was probably a flood of people signing up to be in the military service and three and\nA lot of those uh people may have been newbies to military service a lot of people that grow up and military families they hear about it they learn about it they know what goes on but if\nPost nine eleven was your first encounter with military service uh there's a there's a big learning curve they are right right and and so\nYou know it it's not that the military was going to deny any of these people that applied but a lot of it was people doing something for the first time in their lives that's right and not being able to handle it\nThat's right and in in tone you couldn't be more accurate and a lot of these folks with kids\nYou know we're talking about ... arrows kids\nUh yes technically they're adults but their kids and are instilled developing and in many ways and there's that [noise] so thank God for them and God Bless him that day you know took that oh yeah they put their lives on the line for all of us thank God and God Bless them\nI think though that the reality of war is a you know I've never had the misfortune of of being in combat and and you know and and my role with veterans Inc or really as as a civilian and my background and behavioral healthcare is the reason why I came on board almost Nineteen years ago\nBut to your point tone that you know uh the rush of patriotism after nine eleven was wonderful and fantastic for our country that that so many people felt that way\nBut these young men and women going into the face of war well that's pretty traumatic and a lot of the veterans we talk to to this day all these years after that that period of time\nStill feel the drama and still are dealing with the consequences of that you know some of them literally came back physically wounded emotionally wounded mentally wounded\nAnd they're coping skills or you know they were challenged and sometimes the MSN to tell you that that list of worries you just listed earlier\nYou know that was that's exactly so accurate to describe it that way that you're all alone in your face and all these things you got to worry about in what's one of the things that some people do tell them\nThey look for relief ... and you find relief and a lot of ways and sometimes they're not the healthiest choices that get made 'em and especially if you're in pain put you in a deeper hole yeah and if you've been in pain or physically then is a good chance you prescribe some narcotics\nAnd I don't have to repeat the story you've heard a hundred times you know uh what what that can often lead to\nA addiction dependents or breaking a family's bringing friends separation a solitude loneliness right I'm right so let's get back to your triangle of need um with the housing issue\nWhen a veteran leaves the military service comes back home um is it it must be pretty hard to get back into the swing of things like you're going to rent an apartment or you're going to buy a house you're going to rent a house or what do you what are you going to do\nLike I think has been just described invent and invent costs back me up on this but a lot of the veterans report that they literally were on the field of of fire in Baghdad or Afghanistan in two weeks later they're back home\nAnd just the idea of making that transition from literally a place where you are being shot at and where you're in your in your life is in danger all the time\nNow you're back home in central Massachusetts\nShift and and and and the the the surreal feeling that they have described to us is just unbelievable to the idea that while two weeks ago I was in the middle of all that now I'm here you know and every truck that goes by I imagine that it has yeah yeah for lying that is so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Worcester Speaks Out", "city": "Worcester", "day": "28"}
