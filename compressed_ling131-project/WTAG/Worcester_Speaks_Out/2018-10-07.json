[laughter] you get nervous or um [noise] so ...\nI mean I could ask divide if I Need to know it's okay I can do it I'm just like like I said do you want to look at the notes that I have here that are that are censored yeah yeah\nThat would be helpful okay [laughter] okay [noise] okay [noise] I'm All right it's a ... is a\nMotor neuron disease it's a progressive a neurodegenerative\nDisease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord um and then eventually the motor neurons die and the abilities uh for the brain to initiate the control and muscle movements lost and with that people are affected and they lose their ability to speak um eat moving breeze\nIt's um is it a hereditary\nDisease well there's two different kinds of this oil and sporadic but it's um [noise] if it speak to that maybe if I could probably tell us more about it\n[noise] [noise]\nRight yeah it is both a male and sporadic as they are in our interest in this case this is a sporadic case of the last but for some people as familiar on I think again most people are going to be sporadic but there are right minority of people is a million that can now in ...\nUm [noise] how do you how do you know how do you know you have a a less I mean is it does it start slowly is it a progressive disease um\nHow how does that how do you like hey I Need to get checked in something's not\nRight here maybe I can share with with Christine has case how we kind of arrived at knowing that she had a a last I think [noise]\nUm to start with Christine is speech\nUm started being impeded in that she was speaking more nasal and then she normally would\nAnd actually and they got first Christina thinking was there something wrong with my nose and we actually went to any anti doctor and and we actually I think we had a small surgery to 'cause he had identified that maybe there is you know something wrong and the nasal passage way but that didn't fix it um but I think that combined with\nIn her case some loss of um finger dexterity kind of\nLead us to see a neurologist and they ran a lot of tests and I think that's where kind of seeing that there\nWas the motor neurons were not behaving the way they should and and the tests were kind of pointing towards that this was in a left is is there is\nUm like an age of that this disease affects people visit later in life or is it earlier um I my impression is that it is um later in life but I'm looking at a Christina and you're very young\nAnd beautiful um [noise] no offense to ... I Know she's your wife but\n[laughter] um so it's not just a an older persons disease that comes with time\nAnd you know only ... only in the ... for any over ... ... ... ... ...\n... ... ... can you can in any any ... Hill who is on the ... in\nUm in any one wouldn't ... news\nWow thirty one [noise] um so what are what are the doctors or say when you know after you learn that I'm\nChristina has a a less or what is the treatment what is the plan what is the ah the attacker and I know you you put together a team you have a team of caregivers you have a team of doctors um as far as I Know there is no cure for al ... so how do you treat this going forward\nI think the first message that that you know the neurologist kind of want it to make sure we get when we got the less diagnosis was the fact that there is that there is no cure and I think the strategy is to slow down the progression of a a less ... so we know that\nThe motor control of the of the of the motor neurons in the muscles is going to slowly disappear and on the strategy has such a slow that down so we can enjoy life as much as we can\nI read that the the cost or to take care of someone with AOL says well over two hundred thousand dollars a year [noise]\nUm where do you go to get some help with that because\nNot everybody's got that at their disposal um and where do you where do you turn when you know do you raise your hand and say hey I'm we have insurance but that doesn't cover everything we're going to need some help your where do you go\nI mean that's that's really where foundations like this come into play I think where we can between in what insurance can pay for what we can pay for ourself um what our friends and family can pay for but really\nTo a large extent it's organizations from the community that that also contributed that doesn't really make a piece of [noise]\nThe um ice bucket challenge that really brought a focus to AOL is a because everybody in the brother was doing it and it raised millions of dollars um but I Know Mary Beth ah\nHad her own way of uh addressing for illness or tell us more about Mary Beth first of all just tell her about her in general\nOkay [noise] yeah well I was your sisters my sister she was the oldest of seven kids um she grew up in West or went to assumption college um [noise] either she\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent a major surgery for that had to learn to walk talk and eat again as a result of the surgery from the brain tumor um she had partial paralysis\nDown her face and throat um but she that was in those Tobar of Ninety nine but by February she was back to work a than you know\nHad worked hard to recover and\nUh but then in two thousand and four she was diagnosed with breast cancer or at the time she underwent radiation and chemotherapy and and had a lumpectomy\nI'm at that point she decided okay I'm going to pursue some of the things I have jumped about and she loved to bake so she became a certified pastry chef a and pursued that dream\nUm she also continue to deal with like an auto immune disease that would attack or hearing periodically she had a had already lost or hearing and are right here but this would flare up in an attacker\nThe hearing in her last year or so she continued to kind of struggle with different challenges but in twenty ten after she was laid off from her job of over Twenty years uh she decided she was going to open up a bakery in North for\nCalled cocoa Bennett can factions are so she did that on October first of two thousand and eleven\nUh so she pursued that dream and um\nThen in June of twenty fourteen she was diagnosed with me so the the ... which is a\nA terminal form of lung cancer and shortly thereafter she was also told that she had a a less um\nAnd for her experience you know she had had symptoms kinda flare up in hindsight\nI'm I Would say they were about a year or two prior to her diagnosis um she would have cramped center her arms and legs 'em and they at the time the doctors I think that it was like neuropathy are related to the chemotherapy or radiation treatment that she had for the breast cancer a\nBut things just sort of continued to get worse her uh her left foot started to drop 'em and so she underwent like E. M. G. testing a multiple times I'm for them to to try to determine what was going on\nAnd it wasn't until I'm In August of twenty fourteen she was a going in for a major surgery at Brigham and women's uh for the me so the the alma\nAnd uh\nRight around that time they said well we think he may also have LS [noise]\nAh so she did go through with that surgery that itself was a very major surgery um", "show_name": "Worcester Speaks Out", "year": "2018", "city": "Worcester", "day": "07"}
