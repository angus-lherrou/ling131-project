humor\nSarcasm ... self deprivation yeah you know things like that all of that above well you know John some people don't have a sense of humor anymore have you noticed that everybody's too politically correct I Know I Know\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nUh Dan has a question in Middlebury\nYou did in the morning I listen to your show all the time great show\nWell we're really sorry that it does come in good at the insane asylum ranks [laughter] you see that was another job getting now they ended up said he's going to hang up then how can we do when\nI heard you talking about a replacement doors than we are looking at getting a a servant to replace a door for entry into our garage and the previous one that's Twenty one years old or the ... as you talked about this morning as rotting at the bottom and always that door still is getting a little soft and\nKnow I did talk to the third show a distributor in our area and ah got prices for getting one but I said what put in\n[noise] okay well we can do that need to be with me I was it was that exist in door steel door\nExisting door was a thermometer George just had a a combine a jam\nYeah we are joined the gym and and it's in the garage in the back of the house probably your side of the house in the front of the house okay in the water in the snow when when he plows any snow blows and it just sits there in the gym and it just goes to the center of a disintegration now did you order the door by the way\nNo okay so yes we can come out there and we can take a look at it we can give the options of styles and the pricing and we can get an insult for you no problem\nWith the ... to say to you a damn when you when you called the manufacturers rap\nWell at a store here that sells a no work and stuff like that and a ... okay uh they said they gave me a price on on ordering the door from servitude directly 'cause I I liked the door itself is just the ...\nGive him a shameless plug what was the name of the store to remember a yeah I I'm Sorry I just can't pull it out yeah I see he had some ... you know it it's just like John at home and themselves they don't want to let you know and even\nIf you buy from a quality distributor quality place that's going to order the door it's going to be manufactured and it's going to take two weeks to three weeks to get in that's what you're looking for\nUm you don't want to buy a door that doesn't have a composite Jim Wright and in the closet filled because you'll end up having the problem again\nNow it's the door to his garage is that an important or John yes yes it is and the reason is very simple because everyone doesn't pay attention to that during the the the burglar will try to break through that door because most people all fortify their front door and their back door\nThey don't always fortified the garage door which is something that's very good so Dan\nAbsolutely would love to come out there who will get your name and information and will ah will take a look at it for you is there anything else are we going to\nHave dinner or you do it yourself and you look into an ...\nTo install the John well hear him earlier he said he on someone to install it\nYeah I I wouldn't be able to myself I Do have a neighbor\nWho can who can do that but he's so busy with other thing\nI don't know what to do it will do it right on John Will personally come out and do what do you think\nI can personally come out there and look at that we're the most important and hire more power to garage door as well as measuring it 'cause a lot of them are sick say in that seminal I mean they know that the ... the some of the eight inches or\nSome of them are in Middlebury by the way it's central Massachusetts and what you get out there seven eight and ... lives depended on the house is no it's true by the way it in the doors and I don't know if they're most people make the biggest mistake because they are yeah they\nMeasured and I think it was seven inches but I'm\nOK okay and how old's the house a then\nTwenty one I saw so it's up it's up to alright cold\nWill will come out there and we'll see you how's that Dan okay that's a good thing or hang on one eight hundred three three one nine four Ninety six again one eight hundred three three one nine for nine six if you do have a project that you're thinking about\nAnd you know you got we're talking about doors and security and things like that so we want to make sure that you're thinking of safety now let me remind you of something else you go out and buy a lock and you've got a key how many of us loser keys\nHow many of us has kids that lose the keys how many of us if you lost the key and you can't find the key you can't get into your house so there are things that are programmable\nThat you you do a little punch code you could change the codes that anytime there's stuff that links to your phone\nBelieve it or not those programs absolutely fabulous would you recommend them out\nOn the ... yes yes now do you have to do you have to change the whole door locks no you don't it fits right in the same hole it fits right there it's all internally it's a great product to have an absolutely would make a highly make so much sense for you guys to do\nIs is to yourself type of project Sam Oh it is it takes a you know take some time and patience and by the way just because I'm you know I recommended I still read the instruction yes so if I could read the instructions so can you fly in any good carpenter anybody out there\nI mean they're not reading instructions on how to frame of wall but they do read the instructions and most of the products that get put in right while they're literally doesn't mean the plans yeah\nTo put the ... the reading the plans but if you're installing an electronic if you're putting in something you know a ... foot we're off the hook for stove we were looking at a new one that we're ... we're putting it in the kitchen a high end kitchen\nAnd it's it's something that's built into the cabinet okay so it's not something you just easily\nYou know mount on the wall you know this law school like this one is like there is a hood the cabinet hood many slighted underneath and so you have to dismantle the thing to actually install the thing yes which is you know you read the instructions and\nTells you that you're venting it out to the outside you have to cut through the cabinet\nAnd yet while he cut through the roof the ceiling and then we cut through the wall of the house and so we you know that takes the artwork and then by the way here's the biggest mistake just you know so you you take the duck work and you ducked it out right are you ever going back to that duck work never it's in the wall in the ceiling you never get into it\nYou have to insulate around the duct work not for insulation value but for sounds so that the thing doesn't rattle when he was always use of foam insulation I I Know your phone ... known to the phones ... ... I actually used in this particular case fiberglass just because it was sound barrier it's just to create the vibrations of hype\nJust so it doesn't rattle them against any kind of wood\nAnd this is the only time that we'll be able to do it it wasn't more for installation but we did do the insulation value on the outside with a room Joyce was that it goes out through the house\nSo that was done so that's the good\nSam we've got thirty seconds left to the show ... my name's ... I'm ... and this is of course you know a great honor to be in your on your other another week of trust house cause gone by yeah\nI may not be back next week I think Adam's back right we'll have to we'll have to play that by your oh okay we're going to kick him and kick them out so All right well I appreciate the time John itchy and next week I'm not coming back well we'll see [laughter] than the advertisement\nThe views and opinions express during this program are solely those are the person or people making them do not in any way reflect the views or opinions of news radio five sixty my heart's media or management or employees to use radio I think\n\nThis is news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine than double duty AG and double duty ADHD Worcester and I are ... radio station ...\nIs it going to potentially jeopardize their retirement security\nBut you know was there ever a time in the twenty three years you've been doing the retirement planning with service for group here uh where well we were the interest or have the interest rates ever been this low for as long a period of time as far as investment ... you know ...\nNo never never and that's that's the real significance of why these economic times are so radically different than really any one has ever experienced in their lifetime and\nYou know there's the the ten year treasury is really the main driving force in the economies of what's really that direct relation to all of our consumable loans mortgage is you know any of our debt that that sort of thing and\nThe significance than the impact of that is historically the ten year treasury has always been somewhere between five to seven percent a\nFew times it was higher a couple of times significantly higher but prior to two thousand and eight when the Federal Reserve stepped in as a way to stimulate the economy through the quantitative easing program that they went through [noise] that's really what forced interest rates down below historical averages\nAnd the quantitative easing program drove the ten year treasury rate down to just under one point four percent\nSo these are interest rates that nobody has ever experienced in their lifetime and now the ten year treasury is just back off over three percent hovering around a little over three percent now so we're still a good ways off just to get us back down or back up to I should say the bottom end of normal so\nAgain nobody is really experienced the impact of these low interest rates and how these low interest rates are going to affect them in retirement [noise]\nWell you know conversely I I guess you know the run up and the stock market although in the past couple of weeks it's been a little filed volatile [noise] uh ... how\nDoes that relate well the what happens is for some people you know let's use my grandfather as an example who okay as you\nOr as he came into retirement he started shifting away from mutual funds and that sort of thing and he was using banks CDs which I think a lot of retirees will pretend\nI Would love to see right but yeah\nThat was one you could get five six seven percent on the banks CD and that's when you could live off of the interest that you are generating from the banks cities without eroding principle but now well I guess now you can get a CD for two and a half maybe three percent now because of the interest rates going up\nBut what's happened since two thousand and eight today\nWell the question is OK well where do you go if you want safety and if you want peace of mind and that sort so sometimes it was forcing people to potentially stay\nMaybe a little riskier than really what their risk tolerance called for so that's really where the impact of those low interest rates have had over the next number of years and probably will continue to have over the next few years\nUntil we continue until the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates back up to historical averages\nAnd nearer magical crystal ball do you see that can ... the interest rates continuing to rise for\nThe most part I mean we can only go off of what the Federal Reserve is telling us and they're saying that there's potentially one more uh interest rate increase by the end of this year and then the hope is that they're going to continue on but what they're doing is they're raising interest rates by about a quarter percent each time\nAnd what the hope and the concern was after they drove interest rates down because essentially what they were doing as they were just pumping money to about eighty five billion dollars a month buying us treasuries and you know supply and demand it was bringing interest rates down\nBut the hope was that they were going on the back and obviously they had to stop that because if they're just printing money to the tune of that much and just dumping it into the economy will this setting the seats are some horrific inflation\nSo the hope is that they're going to be able to continue raising interest rates and us that of steady fashion to avoid\nSome hyper inflation type scenarios because if they just have a huge spike in rates well then it's it's really going to bring on the concern of some hyperinflation and then that really has the significance of\nA you know of really downward trend than the economy [noise]\nOkay Mr happy [laughter] and I should mention too as we get started uh we'll get into today's topic in just a couple of minutes from one dimension to you about the ... website which is a great place\nOr even if you're just at the point we're just starting to think about retiring there's some great free information or via their nest egg report at my retirement security dot com and it's sort of a compilation of uh some of the twenty three years the disparate group is ... been doing this and some of the\nBest ways to uh you know avoid some of the pitfalls and some great case histories and some quite a few success story along the way\nAbsolutely of and let me just first I defend myself that you did ask that question is if I was just\nI was just [laughter] that's okay now but uh the\nNest egg report you know that we call it kind of the nest egg report as are as a short version but really [noise]\nAh what the nest egg is titled and and how it functions in terms of educating folks is is how to keep your nest egg safe in these turbulent times is still get the income that you're going to need for a comfortable retirement and that's how we've really built in design that nest eggs so it's taken\nAll of our years of experience it's put it in there to put the process that we go through with clients in there as well as those case studies to show what each of these families what dilemma as they face and what the solutions have been to help them create that comfortable retirement\nWell hence the term solutions based approach to a a worry free retirement which is what are the disparate group is all are all about will get into a today's topic of the day and just a couple of minutes we'll take her first break you're listening to retirement security with attorney Jeff ... phone we shall return\nIt [noise]\nI this is Bob low bell I recently had a conversation with Jeff month that at the Pittsburgh group quite enlightening I must say Geoff explained to me the rules governing how you can receive your Social Security pension benefits\nGuess what they are complex many people make many choices based on limited information and it costs them hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost their pension income out\nThe risk for group as their retirements services for him to disturb Worcester county retirees since Nineteen Ninety eight\nThey operate free that's free workshop that will help you make

weekly visit with attorney Jeff month set from the disparate group I'm ... and the disparate group of course retirement planning specialists known there twenty third year\nOf uh providing a worry free retirement scenarios through solutions based approach and so we were just chatting or off the air during the break a sort of remark and little bit the market's been a little fly the the last couple of days and um that maybe we\nI guess has to do a little bit with China and a little bit with the uncertainty ah with the elections coming up and everything else crazy coming out of\nYeah I mean that's the unfortunate thing here is that that we we\nUh find ourselves and why it kind of feedback into what I said earlier where you know we find ourselves in an economic times that people have experiences because we have\nSo many variables now ... there's so many of volatile opportunities if you will whether we're looking at the political environment whether we're looking at our own economy here domestically whether we're looking at international influences those sorts of things so\nYou know what is it you know nobody really has that crystal ball saying okay well you know if the if the election cycle happens and\nYou know the Democrats take back control or whatever it may be or something happens in China or the current administration does something ridiculous or\nYou know we find ourselves into one situation or another who knows what it's going to be\nBut we know that there's the potential that we may have another correction I mean that's not\nA secret news to anybody we just don't know what the triggering effects are going to be\nIn in the past we can kind of look at ourselves as a shell and be able to gauge and determine okay where is our own economy where is our own market from that standpoint to try and get a better gauge yet where things are\nCollege seven seven forty one six seven hundred or visit my retirement security dot com that's eight seven seven four to one six seven hundred or visit my retirement security dot com [noise]\nNow retirement security continues with Jeff mom said the Memphis comeback\nRetirement security our weekly visit with attorney Jeff month set from the disparate group I'm ... group of course retirement planning specialists known there twenty third year of providing a worry free retirement scenarios through solutions based approach and so we were just chatting\nOr off the air during the break a sort of remark and a little bit the market's been a little fly the the last couple of days and um that maybe we\nI guess has to do a little bit with China and a little bit with the uncertainty ah with the elections coming up and everything else crazy coming out of\nWater yeah I mean that's the unfortunate thing here is that that we we kind of find ourselves and why it kind of feedback into what I said earlier where you know we find ourselves in an economic times that people haven't experienced is because we have\nSo many variables now that there's so many of volatile opportunities if you will whether we're looking at the political environment whether we're looking at our own economy here domestically whether we're looking at international influences those sorts of things so\nYou know what is it you know nobody really has that crystal ball saying okay well you know if the if the election cycle happens and\nYou know the Democrats take back control or whatever it may be or something happens in China or the current administration does something ridiculous or\nYou know we find ourselves into one situation or another who knows what it's going to be\nBut we know that there's the potential that we may have another correction I mean that's not\nSecret news to anybody we just dumped\nWelcome back to retirement security our visit with attorney Jeff ... from the disparate group for retirement planning specialists now and they're twenty third year and the central message mass central Massachusetts area and beyond\n... fell in today we're talking about the potential threats\nTo a worry free retirement which is what the disparate group does through a solution space that approach they do this type of planning and had been doing it now for two plus decades and real quickly I Want to mention to my retirement security dot com which is the disparate group website\nI might want to pop on there and check out what they called a nest egg report because within that report you'll find out a whole lot of free information important things to think about as you approach retirement\nAnd even more importantly some case histories which really point out\nUh the way you can plan for worry free retirement but also see kind of power the jets and his colleagues here at the disparate group or have provided provided solutions for sometimes the situations that don't look like they have a solution\nI absolutely and until and that's why we're we're such a big proponent of about pre planting because until you sit down and until you put together some semblance of a plan whether it's kind of working on your own and working with on a professional that you may be working with\nUntil you do that you're not going to know where you stand in relation to the lifestyle that you want to live in retirement\nYou may have a good idea based on the numbers and based off of your overall savings and investments and that sort of thing but even still until you put numbers down on paper until you go through the budgeting process until you\nKind of figure out what's the drawdown strategy how are you going to generate the income that you need above and beyond\nTensions and Social Security and the passive income that you may have until you start putting those pieces of the puzzle together you're not going to know for sure whether or not\nYou're going to have enough to live well potentially can be twenty twenty five thirty plus years in retirement for the average retire read today so you know you're planning for a significant number of years in retirement and in fact for some cases\nYou may be in retirement for longer than you were actually in the workforce so when you think about that dichotomy between those two scenarios you know have you saved enough or via working career\nTo provide you potentially a longer period of time and retirement that's that can be a scary proposition for a lot of people so you know that's why when I'm sitting down with folks or really want anybody sitting down and it's you know for me I'm more of a visual persons of so I can talk about this or that or the other thing\nBut until I kind of really fine tune it and put numbers on paper the kind of see how things are and and kind of create that road map for clients\nThat's when I think for a lot of people the sense of relief sets in and they they can kind of see the black and white on the paper and say oh hey you know what we're we're going to be okay you know we can develop a plan around this we're going to be able to do what we want to do or you know some people\nOnce they see it on paper I just had a situation like that the other day\nWhere they were kind of hoping to be able to retire sooner rather than later they were offered a potential buyout package but you know when we sat down and crunch the numbers\nIt just wasn't going to be enough to get them where they needed to from a budget standpoint oil and in fact it wasn't even close so we just had to sit there and you know I think they knew and understood that said listen you know what\nAs much as I Would like to take this buyout package I think it's going to make more sense for me to continue working for another five years or so we were talking about because that was going to put them in a much better situation to work on\nGetting that budget number down but as well as giving them the income that they were going to need right now because if they did retire and take that package they just they weren't going to have anywhere near enough income\nNor were they going to have anywhere near enough savings to provide them the additional income they were going to need so it can work both ways but it's just important to take those steps regardless of whether or not you have that gut feeling as to what your situation that a\nWhile and I know a for instance one very dear friend who's now getting Social Security while he's working on this thing is I don't know how I'm going to how long I'm going to live\nBut I'm going to enjoy myself while I'm living in so I don't know if that's the correct allowed for each his own but apps and no two sizes as we always say here on the program fit all your in your own individual financial and familial situation\nAs far as your own state is totally different so it's a a what we talk about here in the program may apply or or may not but let's get back to the topic of the day which where some of the\nSo risks ... or talking about something bigger threats to a secure retirement so you know first off we were talking about uh the bear market threat or the next one will want to talk about kind of piggyback on that is is really riding that market volatility roller coaster for retirement\nAnd other words what that really is referring to is okay so you come into retirement you have your investment plan but do you really know however you're invested what you can safely drawer out for income\nBecause what happens most time has now those savings that held hostage to either that market volatility roller coaster or the uncertainty of interest rates\nBecause if we don't know the interest rates are going to the or we don't know what the market's going to potentially give us or take away from us on an everyday basis that how do we really know what we can safely drawer out\nWithout the risk of running out of money before we run out of time from that standpoint so that's where the market volatility roller coaster can be a threat because for some people\nYou know what are you going to do if you you know what your budget amounts are\nAnd you know the markets declining or interest rates are down or whatever it may be a gonna stop living you got to scale back lifestyle for most people that's not an option most people that they're going to need to generate whatever it is they're going to need to generate and draw that amount of for income\nSo that's another potential jeopardy\nOr in the retirement security portion because we don't know you know we can look at the averages and we can make those assumptions and you could look at the projections and you can do all those sorts of things\nBut how do you really know what the impact is going to be so you've got to look at it again it's not a cookie cutter approach you got to look at each individual circumstance different\nAnd you've got a ... you know get an idea and you get a feeling for what your own individual needs and circumstances of going to be\nAnd what your own individual comfort levels are going to be some people are perfectly fine saying hey listen I'm fine I've been writing this roller coaster for the past forty years and I'm fine writing it through retirement and we develop a plan around that\nOr some people say hey listen you know what I still want to ride the roller coaster maybe with a certain portion of my savings but not all of it uh so we look to build a plan you know from from that standpoint so it's certainly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Worcester", "day": "21"}
