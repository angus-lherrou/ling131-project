{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "... a flexible aluminum yes but I'm now I'm Talking about the bathroom fans with the white duck work that when you put in hot moist stare into a hold addict with nice new insulation and ventilation mold grows inside of it and\nIt if it's not exhausted properly of course sometimes those white flexible tubes are sitting up in the attic right on I mean I'm I'm only found those\nI've I've been in many addicts and I see I see my first question why she all the black mold and all the moisture up in the attic I said so I don't see an exhaust fan event in your bathroom oh we just got an event in into the act I says I Know\nThat I Know I can see that yeah and here's the reason why I can visually see up to this black mold on your on your rafters\nI found water ah almost um two cups of water inside of one of those flexible pipes are sitting in the ... because it went vertically up and then it came down and had a little s in it right and lo and behold there was water sitting in and that's what was dripping\nAnd causing a leak inside of their house and they said jeez we don't understand where the stain is coming from and when I showed it to him they couldn't believe that\nLife the the the best point is from a to B is a direct point yeah what is no windows no I'm a ... or ... or a the\nFewer and fewer bends and\n\nWhen you when you in your bathroom and you've got to exhaust fan on let it run for an extra Fifteen twenty minutes you know go get dressed and go back to the bathroom and shut it off if you shut it off the minute you get out of the bathroom the moisture is trapped in ... instead of flux too\nYes and so you have to leave it running but now believe it or not John ... the new technology of today is that the fan will continue to run even after you shut it off okay and now the new technology in the bathroom fans have moisture meters and\nEven the new technology of today considering that you're now you're houses more tight\nHaving a very low average and its exchanging the air\nIn and out of your house so it's actually sucking air out and it's and it's actually helping people and their rises so as the ... and also sucking air in and of course exchanging the heat you know and that's what it's doing and so again um there's a lot of new technology that goes into the bathroom fans and most people don't know about\nRight and if you gotta if you're buying the bathroom fan measures the square of the Cuban footage of the bathroom not the square footage of the bathroom the superhero allow enough ... of a yeah preached to let that he'd scape right\nSo you know this is um something that uh most people when they're out there and they're thinking of all I Need a new fan in the bathroom\nFor ... they don't think he's a great topic this time of year yeah it is when your clothes in your house up in your seal it up for the winter\nOnly putting driveway markers down yeah you're [laughter] you're getting the snow blower ready right you know like\nA you know those those are a article on the news this morning where you can buy in a ... a a air exchanges of filter and they deliver it to you once a month or once every two months or so you so you can change it automatically without thinking about changing it it will come in the mail\nIt was just like a huge razor blades just like just like anything you know a mail service uh they have that they have that on on line though yeah they do\nIt also it John it's amazing that the stuff that you think you knew and now they keep coming up with a better mouse trap and yet [noise] [laughter] no no no offense to that myself you know I've got to make sure I don't insult any mice so it's supposed to be careful I don't want to\nAnyway so yeah there's there's always a better way of creating something you know this is a ... the ventilation insulation and we in in a sense the show's been about ventilation\nYes right you know think about it because we are venting your bathroom were venting your roof were venting your dryer yes no moisture that's inside your house is not a good thing so now the winter the summertime here we've the humidifier in your basement John yes okay where's the moisture go\nDid you put did you have to pick it up every time an empty and put it in the ... you have it automatically draining out\nWell I have I I don't have that much moisture in my ... my basement\nSo it's not something that's turned on and off all the time so you know it's it's a it's not a you have a industries Mitt yes it's it's not a job\nFor me per se but I Do have my air conditioning like my air conditioning is that divide I'll okay so so these are things that are very important that if if the do you live fire shuts off the demystify shuts off that means it needs to be happy\nYeah and that's it and so there are people out there that do it themselves they have to take care of it and they they you know they empty it out themselves and there's other people that are of course\nNow you have um the perimeter of what did they call the ... not to my God I Can't even French strength French strains and let me have the uh\nYou know the water basement systems you know what I mean so you know you have all these different type of things that prevent water and moisture and everything else from going wrong you know so that it it's it's funny how we had this topic grow into\nThe\nMoisture of your home you know now next thing you know the someone will talk about gutters\nGot us [noise] I don't want to do you eat a lot of talking about going to know gutters is not fun you know I don't like that or ... well got to go to us and then the next week or so gutters will be a a an issue [laughter] people clean 'em out\nWe're gonna have to have a show on gutters next week and what do you think maybe if you want a topic what would you like\nUm just to reiterate some of the people that have been making comments on Facebook of courses that ad again is saying how the Panasonic units are usually the best ones to buy and I totally would agree with that\nThe Panasonic whisper quite fans are nothing but the best than what I use in their sorry a pair of socks and the check to Sandra's REO impacts and police\nAnd more than happy to take your check so we'll do that was that the unit Sam ... well the Panasonic unit as a manufacturer that makes um different types of fans will kind of do all different kinds of things so\nUm they do make a heat and air exchange or offer basements if a remodeling your basement believe it or not you have to have\nA heat and air exchange or in your basement if you don't have enough windows so my house has no windows in the basement if not the too small so in order to have that we have to put in heat in air exchanges\nIn ... so you have to let air air flow into the house so if you got the the old wooden windows that were leaking air filtration now if you put new a vial replacement hopper windows in there you need to open 'em up because there's not enough air flowing into the house to make a buck for window\n\nOnto the new building code in order for you to have\nUm the correct amount of air exchanging in that basement so it creates a confined space so under the new building code you have to have a heat and air exchange or in your basement and they sell one which is pretty reasonably priced ... don't do that and you leave it running\nWell as on the newer homes are already invested all through the sidewalks and an older home if you pull a new unit into the basement any developed it I'll properly yeah\nAnd that's exactly part of the process that the they want you to put into bio side yeah it's a and something else that needs to be done when you're a model in your basement\nYeah so well in any time we model you have to bring things up to code you and when you remodel in you know the ... the average increase or a ... mile job where you need a new\nService from a ... a little for two hundred and ... if you don't have enough circuits yeah his is now coming out of the time to do it sucks panel on there to make\nYes you can John and again this is the questions that are good contractor should be able to identify before he gives you a number\nSo starting with let's diagnosed your home just like a good doctor yeah you know hey doc can you give me two pills no wait let's sit down let's take a medical history let's see what you've got let's understand what you're looking for and then will determine what the the the correct curious 'cause that's what we do in home improvement\nI was I was always taught when I when I was looking at an addition or a basement meanwhile our kitchen remodel hold down and take a picture\nOf the uh the surface circuits yeah let's see if there's enough circus of those open circuits are the\nNumber one by the way when you're doing a bathroom first thing you go down as you look at the water meter yeah why if the water meters only three quarters of an inch pipe coming in that now has to be upgrade to a one in Maine and that all are three quarter inch has to be fed to give it the right amount of pressure from the ... meter all the way to all the other sources we got about\nThirty seconds left to the show see I'm a guy closing thoughts\nThoughts you know this show is about the little humor and a little bit of\n... absolutely I mean it is it's and I don't think it's for people particularly if you're I think that's just life in general today because of the age of technology and that sort I mean\nWhen you think about even for me growing up I mean you you would worrying about what was happening essentially the next day as the as the morning paper came out you know that was the only thing that you were a tracking from that standpoint so in this day and age where\nEverything is right then and there in your face I think it's you're almost inundated by too much information\nWhereas you know we kind of call you know paralysis of the analysis we have so much information and you know who knows what's correct who knows what incorrect or you know different people have different\nI'm going to ... depends on what it is your reading and what information what advice you're seeking and that sort that sometimes that can be truly overwhelming especially for you know again people your generation so when you talk about Medicare [noise]\nI I mean there are so much information that you are going to get on those Medicare supplemental plans\nYou're not going to know what's up or down our sideways in or how to really interpret one program for another\nUnless you want to spend a considerable amount of time dissecting through those programs to figure it out so\nYou know I think technology is great in many many ways but it also can be a hindrance at some point in time because again you tend to get further into the weeds than perhaps you really need to what some of these particular topics well\nAnd I think to a and again you know at least as far as the the mail I've been saving up these various insurance plans I mean there's the sales pitch and every one but it's just kind of interesting how they are you ready and have you thought about in my God you're sixty five\nIt's just those you know all of a sudden it's here so [noise]\nA little bit of pre planting and I'm sure a lot of the folks that attended the workshops that the disparate group puts on a no obligation educational workshops to go a long way to at least starting that road to a worry free retirement\n[laughter] it is absolutely and that's why you know we do it because quite frankly you know the\nThe nature of our business and helping people create a bullet proof retirement plan and a retirement income planet and help to achieve that peace of mind\nWe have to be looking at all of these different components and Social Security first and foremost is the first building block of that plan because that's going to be a certain component of your income in retirement so we need to be paying particular attention to that\nTo making sure that we're getting everything that we can possibly get out of that benefit program\nOkay with that said in a thanks again to everybody who attended the disparate group Web a workshops and of course what they fire up again in the spring Ryan Krause writes ah so now what to eat the past couple three shows we food comes zeroed in on Social Security what's next we\nDid in a quite frankly [laughter] you know we can probably go on for another month on on just some of those topics but [noise]\nYou know well you know as time goes on like we do is most shows you know we touch a little bit on the Social Security component in one capacity or another so we'll continue um down that path and like all the ways of people have any direct questions in regards to that\nThey can simply um go right to the website my retirement security dot com\nAnd rights of the contact us pay a chicken Smith any questions or that they may have been we'd be happy to address those weather on air or sometimes they're you know personal such questions pertaining to their a situation that we can uh certainly addressed with them directly\nOkay and I'm at typically towards the end of the program if you're a new listeners at the program we usually try to get to at least a couple of a listener questions which tend to shut up more light on some of those issues that you may be confused about so don't be shy if you do have any questions\nSo what we want to get into today's ... we're going to talk about the essential components of a sound retirement plan\nAnd you know that's really important today you know and the volatile situation that we find ourselves in in the economy and\nAnd really what's happening out there as interest rates are on the rise of how the market is reacting to the interest rates on the rise is this kind of the the beginning stages of a potential market correction you know we don't know one way or another but I think over the short term will will be figuring that out\nBut that's you know that's unfortunately the situation that a lot of retirees find themselves in today that if you're looking over the short term and you want to retire over the next three five potentially seven years well we have to take a look at the state\nOf the economy as it stands now and you have to take a look at what you're available resources are at the stage of the game and do you have the resources that you're going to need to live the lifestyle that you want in retirement and if you do at this stage of the game\nOr why jeopardize the comfort of that so [noise]\nYou know that's unfortunately the situation again that the retirees are facing today because they are facing the real likelihood of a market correction either very shortly into retirement or perhaps just before they're about to retire so we have to be looking at\nWhat the impact that can potentially have\nOn their retirement as well as what the potential impact that can have on them potentially running out of money before they went on a time\nWell let me ask you this and I and I realized again you're not a suit say air and you know after the magic financial crystal ball\nBut in your experience and the twenty three years that you've been working doing retirement planning\nI'm ... ... is you know looking back historically is that usually a pretty accurate representation of how the market will act in you know in in a given time period I mean is it that or could it's you know could just be happy\nDays for the rest of ... at least my life\nWell I mean that certainly it's like everything's that but it goes in cycles right so and it's really driven off of valuation so as soon as you know there's really two things is real value when as emotion that can drive and so from a real value standpoint that's where the the cycles of the market commend where\nAs the market becomes way overvalued well we have the correction to bring us back down and that's just the cycle now those cycles can be differing lengths of time uh but\nThat's the you know how the economy tends to evolve around ... along the way I mean we just happen to see one and two thousand and one for different reasons and then we saw in two thousand eight but those happen to be within a short relatively short amount of time from that standpoint now [noise]\nYou know who knows when you know the next one potentially could occur but you know for somebody that's been retired over the last Twenty years I mean that they're facing the real likelihood of free pretty major market declines in that period of time which you know it's going to be somewhat unusual for them\n[noise] All right we're chatting with

retirement\nSecurity as we chat with attorney Jeff ... from the disparate group the disparate group that you've been a regular listener to the program by now you know their retirement planning specialists\nAdjusting his colleagues here have been doing that now twenty three plus years through a solutions based approach\nAnd again uh the ultimate goal is providing a retirement plan for you that you need not have to worry about in in today's turbulent times\nAnd uh some of the craziness of the stock market of late I'm sure folks uh well I Know I've been thinking about it and it takes you know quite a bell ringing for me to pay attention but I Am paying attention [noise]\nUh and uh so uh again\nAs we get back into our discussion I keep in mind or the ... my retirement security dot com or today is a discussion a kind of we've wrapped up our uh two or three shows with Social Security now that's one of the important components of a secure retirement what are some of the other ones we should be thinking about Jeff\nSo uh the ... the first one it really feeds into and what we've been talking about here uh through last segment is the first component is going to be income right that's number one and that really encompasses again\nA pensions Social Security any other income sources that you may need but more importantly that's got to be income that is going to support your lifestyle throughout retirement with certainty and that's a critical piece\nSo along with that it's going through the budget process so if you haven't done a budget yet\nWell try to start charting out what your expenses are\nThat's something that we find out maybe about fifty percent of the time that people come in and\nThey've actually been working off of a budget or some people have been pretty diligent and they've got a spreadsheet that trust the last five years of expenses and that sort and we have other people that come in and say hey you know what\nI'm saving money we're paying our bills you know we've got a pretty decent nest egg accumulated and you know we just we haven't really ever worked or lived off of a budget because we've always been able to live within our means save a little spend what we want to stand that sort of thing\nBut now once those paychecks are going to disappear as you approach retirement becomes more critically important to really go through the budgeting process drilled down through those expenses figure out what your actual at least from an essential expense standpoint figure out\nHow much it's going to cost you to live that lifestyle because that's going to be the foundation of any plans if that you can really build upon it can't be just guessing and saying well you know I think I might need three thousand among the five thousand a month but I'm not really sure well\nYou know what as painful as it may be you really have to sit down and go through that budget process because\nYou certainly don't want to make any guesses and then build and design this plan and come to find out hey yeah you know we're going to be able to\nGenerate X number of dollars of income per month\nBut then all of a sudden you get into retirement you're like whoa I didn't realize that this was that expensive war we had this expense or that expense or how much Medicare supplemental insurance is going to be\nAnd then you ... you know this situations where they've underestimated by thousands of dollars on a monthly basis in in in that\nCertainly is going to put in jeopardy any potential plan that you put in place so that's the most important key to that particular component is you know let's figure out from an income point of view\nHow much your lifestyle is going to cost you what sources of income do you have coming in is they're going to be a shortfall and really find a solution as to how to solve that particular income dilemma\n[noise] uh do you are in general and then a ... and as we often see in the program you know not no one size fits all here but she said about fifty percent of the folks of of of bin of my ilk which is\nYou know as long as I've got work on the table and I've you know I've got a month or so out in front of me of a you know work I can count on and and pay check\nUm is it a huge adjustment for a lot of folks to be able to you know 'cause I I really much like perhaps buying a burial plots arranged for final expenses I don't really want to look at my budget because I don't really want to go [laughter] you know\n... you know and I don't think you're too far off from a lot of the lines of thinking out there but it is so critically important for people to do that\nSo to get an idea because if you have time on your side if you have three five seven years ahead of retirement\nWill start going through that budget start figuring out what your needs are going to be because that's going to allow you to figure out whether or not you are on track to be able to retire when you want to retire\nVersus somebody that says I'm a kind of stick my head in the sand then\nI'm going to retire at sixty six and then come to find out you're kind of scrambling around a few months before you plan to retire and you're like\nOh boy I'm not going to be able to do this I'm going to have to work a little bit longer or I may not be able to retire for several more years it's because of the fact that you weren't doing any of that free planning a long way to really gauge how close you are to meeting your overall objectives\nWell and again I think uh you've mentioned the term um and I can't remember what it is\nIn reference to a investments as far as the stock market is concerned here I'm\nIn other words that the timeframe of those changes in the market and how it affects you because when you retire sequence the sequence of return sequence of returns now that is something for me individually that is become glaring only important for me personally in the past couple of weeks just because it's\nBeen a little shaky in the stock market and ethical whoa wait a minute", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Worcester", "day": "14"}
