thirty percent but it might be five or eight percent more but that's money you really shouldn't have to pay and that way they they've got it on the books and and and and they've got it secured and you and you move forward that way and it's really the same with the masonry masonry is going to like seeing that\nReady to go on their books but right now it's not appealing to them because they got too many customers and not enough time\nTo close up and you're and you don't want a job to be rushed you again you've waited this long get the job done right in the spring if the if the roof isn't leaking now um you know let's wait till the spring but get a get a nicely appointed project set up for yourself or the spring\nAnd a and locking up a pretty competitive price now 'cause who knows the way the market's going like we've received three roofing a shingle and accessory price increases in this year absolutely ridiculous and we're expecting to more or by spring so\nIt just that's what's happening folks take advantage sometimes it stay stagnant you don't get any increases for three years\nBut right when they get an opportunity to do so they will so um that's just what we're all working with but hopefully that helps\nIt guy that was really great yeah they are very formative you guys are always are\nAny time and cause anytime we love to hear from you know we hear from the other\nSide here you know we we want to know what you guys are are are dealing with word guessing because what we're seeing but we're not seeing it from your perspective um so we want the feedback but hold the line which we will send you out to a three hundred dollar voucher and hopefully\nThat helps you in the future perfect break ... pick your eight hundred three three one nine for nine six eight hundred three three one nine for\nNine six now of course the floodgates are open everybody wants to call we got ten minutes less uh we got Paul in Worcester you've got questions about ... on the roof\n... hey good morning are you doing morning ...\nUh yeah there's a bunch of Martian bowl on shingles on trees and stuff that we're hanging over a year's sheriff's only like six or seven years old we've got most of the trees and limbs cut back ... what's the what's the best way to remove that Russia Washington or is this some of the trick you guys have\nYet so I'm six or seven years pretty quick to get that on most shingles should have a fifty year algae resistant to ... ... you know Fifteen your\nAlgae resistance shingle the certain teaching all does maybe this is a ... for something else but I'm Glad John ...\nIs it black airborne algae or is it the mosque growing from the north side of the trees\nI'm going to say it's more ... than anything else\nOkay yeah so that that means you have no no sign on that in the in the trees are hanging over\nThe roof and it and they're practically maybe uh three feet away from the top of the roof with the sap from the trees are just saturated on top of the roof and are creating the mold and the moisture is just can dry the the the shingle can dry enough and it's creating more there's\nThere's about three things you can do okay roof is only six seven years I Know that's that's shocking but he ... you must have a lot of trees up there or you know it was\nIt was the trees were almost weighing on yeah yeah that that's what I'm saying you you got like coverage like it you can't breathe but so so basic basically what you first thing you can start with the good news is that it only being six or seven\nYears old the shingles are really hardy so you've got to be careful when you got a twenty year old roof and you do a pressure wash you can really grind out a lot of the grand you'll see in and put yourself in worse shape than you are but it only being six years old\nYou can be pretty aggressive with the pressure wash and and it's not gonna just deteriorate you know that quickly when you when you pressure wash it they do have some some light brushes 'cause usually like when it's professionally done they kind of scrape off the boss with with some with some brush which is fine again six seven years in you shouldn't compromise the shingles much\nLincoln's isn't growing on it yet where well you know he doesn't know if he's got that he's not up there looking at but you can also get\nZinc strips you know the the certainty jingles have ... and the shingles um which keep the acidity stuff from the rain you get those black streaks but this should help you to if you put a couple zinc strips up by the ... that should help you a little bit I'm just another thing you do to combat it but here's the here's the best answer cut the tree down [laughter]\nNo it's definitely been cut back and ...\nYeah or the branches you know are are\nAre the branches and I get the you know we've we've been doing this a long time so we get this a lot and you know of course it's going to continue you know you can pressure wash it and get it out there but if you got that that health thing in coverage over what the branches it'll it'll\nCome right back or continue yeah best bet it'll get some Iran and let it breathe a little bit\nAlthough they'd have little ... and forget it it's a chemical that you can just spray on your roof and let the nature take take its course and clean it up for you\nBut depending on which moss you have on there and even even a roof seven years old you have to be careful scraping off the granular is off the roof or off the main roof once you start removing the boss you should have done by professional company this we hear that can warranty the products we also\nAll right well thank you very much\nYeah my pleasure thanks for calling in and again we've we appreciate the phone call in to help you out the best we can in the future hold the line Leanne will take area eight hundred three three one nine for nine six eight hundred three three one nine for nine six is number to call get four minutes left plenty of time for callers to call in and what about you know jumping on a ...\nA material there would that work on the ... the roof max\nYeah I mean so room acts as a good product in terms of getting that done there's guarantee of five years of again keeping my it's never going to tell you you got five years left of\nIt's not gonna leak right 'cause that's a different scenario but it does give it a little bit of hardening of the shingles what it does it goes into the shingles themselves in that kind of strengthens it from the inside out so that they don't crack\n... will expand the shingle itself\nI'm no I don't think it expands it it just kind of\nAbsorb the yeah the ... into the texture of\nThe show almost like you know you have the um\nThe product that goes in that that keeps the the baseball glove with leather you don't get a kind of softens it right so it's the opposite you don't want to harden so that doesn't crack tracking is what makes right right right so it keeps it kind of soft and um you know I hesitate to have the roof max discussion because really\nDon't don't fool yourself right roof max is for the clients that has the immaculate lawn and his proactive and changes their oil too often\nAnd yes\nAnd really and really keeps your your your your roof in tip\nTop shape and you're looking to extend the roof and it's not for [laughter]\nAnd you're listening it's not for the folks that are already have a ... smashed deteriorated roof that as our should have been replaced ten years ago but that's usually who has interest right because they're doing it for the wrong reasons you know hey it's only going to cost me a third of the cost of a roof\nSo let's get this done and and go from there we got one call for one more uh one more chance to get another caller and we've got Jim in in the old Jim you got a discussion about a\nLead I Believe the EPA stuff\nRegarding the lead paint a certification for run invaders I didn't realize it was not only I mean apparently it's across the board for contractors the lead paint certification requirement by state\nYeah and how one might use that to either you know I didn't want to start start a small business what I find\nI have to your employees would have to be certified why don't you know why is it more known about this and and I wouldn't want to use this to either\nActually you know to get a job or to work with some of these contractors 'cause truthfully I haven't heard about it\nUm\nI could I could talk for five hours about the subject and for all we only have a few minutes left but it's a touchy one because really it's a very under the radar thing and if I if I if I'm being completely honest about it I think that it's a\nA it was the reason why you don't hear about if they want all the organizations EPA the states want you to be certified because it kind of targets you quite frankly as a contractor and um and they want you to have the training\nIt's a it's a sad state of affairs but the reality is that if you're not licensed with this stuff\nThen you kind of fly under the radar and it's just the way this enforced as a joke they basically going to look for guys that can afford to get the train and get it done so that you're available to be fined\n[laughter] it's a I I Can't stand it any other way and they'll sell you on the idea and the classes that hey let's let's get trained so you can win more jobs you're not winning more jobs by having that certification but yes we do have it as a as a requirement 'cause you have to\nAh when you're of our size but um I I'm not a big fan of it I'm quite frankly and I think that the the learning that takes place in there is not very advanced\nWhile you have to vote of construction supervisors license now to be a lead certify the ... location\nYeah okay what ... what if if one were to use that and say hey you know you're going to hire\nWell you you have to make more money per job it is these news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine FM double duty AG meant W. A. T. A. G. H. D. Worcester and I argue radios\nYeah double duty AG\nTheir victims I'm happy to sell ... news the names of the eight men and three women gunned down at a Pittsburgh synagogue have just been released the victims include a husband and wife and a pair of brothers at a news conference a short time ago Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city is resilient\nRight so what we were alluding to when we had that conversation I think we're just talking about that last week as a matter of fact it's kind of writing that volatility roller coaster as when you look back at some of the major market corrections and you look at how those played out over time\nAnd some of those instances they were more up days\nThen there were down days or at least just as many up days or as the word down days it was just\nThe downs were lower than the ups will hire over the long term so to you know to use your words that slow erosion over time we're sometimes you can be lulled into the fact of thinking okay well what was up for now is down you know or you know I'm All right\nThat kind of and that's exactly what my mindsets been with this recent activity which\nYou know it doesn't have to be some people just come in and they say you know what I don't want to have to worry about it I don't want to have to think about it you know that sort of you know and some people like to be actively involved in it and making sure and and looking at it\nDaily or several times a day or whatever it may be so it just depends on kind of where you fall along\nThat line to say okay well what may or may not make sense in terms of\nRecommending overall strategies or or how to create income or whatever it is that's important to you or what the overall objectives are\nNow are you trying to continue to build your portfolio to six seven figures and be able to pass it on or whatever it may be or you looking to use your portfolio for your benefit throwing life\nAnd hey if there's going to be anything left and great that's a pass on to this just depends on whatever the goals and objectives are so it's it's really you know individualize and subjective as to you know what's the appropriate approach for each individual\nAnd the other thing I think we've talked about a number of times and I know you have a special term for it and what is it about a year returns the timing of your returns it it's the sequence of return sequence of returns meaning\nYou know it's okay if you're fifty two when you have a serious a two thousand eight and you've got ten years to kind of make it back right now I'm probably five years from retirement fulltime\nAnd um I don't think I could really shoulder that much of a hit right now well\nWhat we mean by that and how we use the the terminology and and the kind of show people the impact of sequence of returns as when you think about it\nYou know from you know let's just take you as an example of so from when your age forty to age sixty well you know what you're not so concerned about those sequence of returns or how you were earning those returns or what the average annual raise the cycle on a way\nIt's just kind of you know what this is where it is we're going to ride the roller coaster of the market and it's kind of a\nA by and whole type thing or yeah this is what it is we'll make some adjustments and changes along the way but you know what I Know I'm not going to have to be drawn ring off of these retirement savings this is here to build and accumulate as long as possible until I Need it\nWhere the sequence of return risk comes in is now you've gotten to a point where you've accumulated a masked whatever your math but now you need to be drawing off of those savings\nBecause if you look at a ... you know you pick any period of time and the market but if you look at say from two thousand until today in two thousand and Eighteen\nWell we've had a few good bull market runs but we've had some pretty severe beer ... bear markets in that period of time as well\nSo if you look at some individual points in time through the past Eighteen Nineteen years you know let's look at an example of if you retired in two thousand and six\nAnd then within the next two to three years you experience they pretty significant bear market downturn or how is that going to look compared to somebody who may retire in two thousand and ten\nJust on the cusp of one of the best bull market runs we've ever seen in history from that standpoint [noise]\nSo that's where the sequence of return risk comes into play where those two individuals one retiring in two thousand and six one retiring in two thousand and ten\nIf you retire with the same exact amount of money and you want a drawer out the exact same amount of income that's where the sequence of return rest comes in because that person who retired in two thousand and six experienced the down years early on\nThey're going to have a significantly different outcome in terms of the viability of their retirement security the viability of running out of money before they run out of time\nVersus the person who retired in two thousand and ten so the situation you have to pay a lot more attention to it now once you're getting ready to retire are planning to retire and really be looking at those timelines of okay when is it\nThat I'm going to need to start drawing or perhaps one is it that the IRS it's going to force you to start drawing money out of your retirement accounts and that's really um you know what's\nFurther uh the for the complexities that retirees are faced with today is because we have a lot you know these economic times are so different than anything that they face or anything really that\nTheir parents and face in their lifetime so it's just it's something new that people are getting accustomed to but it's something new that we also have to be planning for\nWith that said ah do you factor those types of things and when you ... you know a cheaper plan for a client\n[noise] we do and that's why our planning models are very you know and again it's not a one size fits all but what we look to do here and and what we strongly encourage people to look at isn't instead of just\nComing into retirement with that investment planner that investment strategy you've been using free of growth and accumulation years maybe it makes sense to revisit and take a look at it and say okay is this going to accomplish what my goals and objectives are at this point in time\nIs this going to allow me to generate to draw down uh my assets and create whatever additional income it is I'm going to need\nOr does it make sense to say OK Now let's refocusing re strategize around the investment plan and what we look to do is say OK let's create an income planned first let's secure the income\nOpponents of your plan so that you know regardless of what's happening out there in the market that you can draw the income that you're going to need and then once you've done that is then you can develop the income plan second\nSo that that can support you from an income standpoint so one inflation heads or you want to do some discretionary spending or replace a car or travel or whatever it is that folks want to do in retirement\nYou know they've kind of compartmentalized a different portions of the savings so that they know okay this is generating my income I don't have to worry about you know as we mentioned earlier or what's happening today or what's happening from the morning till the afternoon and how has that impacted me and\nYou know what am I losing or what am I gaining you know so when we can look at it from that standpoint and secure the income that's where that peace of mind factor comes into\nPlay he is attorney Jeff ... from the disparate group retirement planning specialist uh we'll be right back to get into the topic of the day and will tell you also been about my retirement security dot com some of the great stuff you can find on that website the F is for group ... when

and continue to evolve that report zip is\nUh this is Bob low bell\nI recently had a conversation with Jeff month that at the Pittsburgh group quite enlightening I must say Geoff explained to me the rules governing how you can receive your Social Security pension benefits\nGuess what they're complex many people make many choices based on limited information and it costs them hundreds of thousands

forty one six seven hundred or visit my retirement security\nDot com shooting is limited [noise]\nNow retirement security continues with Jeff mindset ...\nBack to retirement\nSecurity with attorney Jeff ... from ... in today's discussion as we always chat about to worry free retirement scenario with the help of Jeff in his colleagues at the disparate group\nOf today are just kind of thinking about those key ingredients to a successful and worry free retirement by the by the way the disparate group website my retirement security dot com great\nPlace to get started thinking about planning for a success for retirement and some great free tools there to like the nest egg report so in the last segment we talked about your emotional and physical wellbeing I mean I I guess in your experience\nYou are going to have some kind of a medical issue at some point in your retirement it's pretty inevitable\nIt is absolutely there's there's no question about that but I think for a lot of people what that really comes down to\nIs control you know if we can get ourselves in a position where where as healthy as possible both emotionally and physically heading into retirement or we're going to feel\nIn somewhat more control through that transition that we have to go through because you know another key that we often talk about it it's it's normal to feel stressed\nBefore retirement and heading into retirement through that transition so you don't want to further complicated if you're dealing with\nYou know whatever health issues you may be dealing with it and then we are exacerbating it was okay now we're going to be retiring at the same point in time so you want to get yourself in a position where\nYou can feel you know and as much control as possible from the standpoint of allowing yourself to kind of you know you it's got to be stressful but you're going to be able to go through that transition\nEnvy dealing with a with a clear mind and as healthy as possible so that's you know that's why we find a it's critically important to again take that baby step approach and try to put pieces of the puzzle together because again if you're trying to do it at the last minute and you're dealing with\nEmotional physical whatever the circumstances maybe for you and now you're trying to all of a sudden and quickly retire well it's going to be a tough road the Gulf or not that it can't happen and it can't work for you but why\nPut the extra burden than the extra stress on yourself if we can potentially avoid that\nYou're saying um I shouldn't invest in that a shiny new sports new hip the titanium hip it just before I pull the plug on my working years [laughter] anyway All right so that you know that's a great point and and I'm sure you've seen\nUh the adjustment folks have to make all of a sudden without much more time on their hands to that kind of plays with your emotions and psyche\nYeah absolutely and we get so many comments and you know ... it's not just us but any articles that you read from folks who are retiring and more and more of this information is coming out because where\nI think we're around seven or eight years in to kind of the earliest of the baby boomer generation haven't retired at sixty five or sixty six so there's a lot of great data that's coming out from those early baby boomers and and that's really feeding a lot of this information to say okay\nWhat were they experiencing what would they go on for what was some of their concerns are all that sort of thing so we're getting that directly from our clients as well as that data is available for us to research so that we can help other clients are moving forward and\nSo these are a lot of the major concerns we get because some people I've had clients who\nUh they had children who moved away out of state and the plan was okay once we retire we're going to move to be closer to our children but guess what\nThey did it but now they left their circle of friends they left their comfort in okay now they're closer to their children but guess what their their grandchildren are in school all day sure their children and the inlaws they're at work all day so now they're left by themselves for the majority of the time\nIn an area where they don't have any circle of friends so you know some people may be more outgoing and others and they get actively involved and they find new centers of influence and different activities to do and that sort of thing but you know some people don't want to do that or they're just not interested in doing it and then that kind of\nBrings on that emotional piece of saying well what do we do do we make the right decision you know now we've got to travel ... an hour or two back to go visit friends or go out to dinner or whatever may be rather than kind of\nBeing based in the community in which you've lived for all those years you know you run into a lot of those type of situation so again\nYou know try to figure it out you know that situation you may not know until you kind of put yourself into that position but you know these are all things that you have to be thinking about from that standpoint to know you know how\nHow is it going to be ... what do we want to try and do or what what's our objective if we want to move closer to children what's the objective of that to spend more time with them well okay in reality are we going to be able to spend more time with them you know I I always think back to\nYou know what what Fred talks about here and in a in regards to spending time with his grandkids he's like you know what [noise]\nHe's like you you got to spend as much time with them as you can as early as you can because he says you know once they become teenagers they just don't have any interest in in in hanging around with the old farts anymore so you know they want to be with their friends you know and that sort of you were serving on the age of ... you know those are all experiences that people have to\nGo through on their own but again you have to be considering your own happiness in retirement as you begin to make those decisions\nOkay so we've got that one nailed down moving on\nSo you know we always talks about all that a a another key is having a pension you know that can certainly help from a retirement security standpoint\nPassion that or having a successful retirement you know we we talk about that quite often and you don't want people think about that\nThey always have a natural tendency is to just kind of think about oh well you know my dad had a pension or my uncle had a pension on my mom had a pension whatever it may be you know I I'm just not in a job that is going to pay me a pension you know maybe I have a four O. one K. or an IRA or whatever it may be\nBut when we say having a pension can help\nWhat that also means is can you possibly create your own pension which we often do offer clients and that's part of creating that income plan for you as a centrally creating your own pension\nBecause if you can have a a definitive amount of income coming in that you know is going to be there for you\nWell that's going to create some peace of mind and that's what we mean by you know creating or pension or having a pension from that standpoint so it's looking at the overall retirement savings and in looking at\nThe different sources of income and how you going to solve your own personal income scenario in retirement well\nIf you had a pension or a few created your own pension is that going to give you more peace of mind than just saying okay well this is what we have and\nYou know if we're getting this return we can ... we need but if we're not getting this return what do we do we scaled back lifestyle do we stop living you know what are the one of those situations present so that's another key component that we often find can can make a big difference and folks retirements\nAre with that said uh when you say well create your own pension how does that differ from just having a retirement plan it's the same thing correct\nIt's a component of the retirement plans of so in other words you know how to you create that tension because there's different ways of doing it\nAnd so it's got to be one particular component of the overall plan so again whether that's a defined pension plan that you have from a former employer that we can create a plan around\nOr are we looking to say okay well you've got\nX number of dollars as a a retirement portfolio why don't we look to carve out a piece of that portfolio and use that to create your own pension so that you can", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Worcester", "day": "28"}
