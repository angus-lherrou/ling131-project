{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WTAG", "content": "To see what's behind it and then you lifted you're telling me a story then between break at a there was five loose and flooring and every time he pulled a layer out there was more and more and more and more\nAnd what happens is it a leak it develops send you it it just doesn't disappear to my right everyone got multiple layers of floor\nThey're going to spread through the floor and absorb my plywood in you know laminate and plywood and all this stuff underneath your kitchen it absorbs right it doesn't dry out so you have to get to invite you know by the way prevents water from going through the vinyl\nSo that it doesn't soak the wood right John yes yeah so what do you think happens when the water gets under the vinyl\nHas no place to try and has no place to brief no place to breed mold starts growing so if you start coughing and your kitchen every time you walk in you might have a problem\nRight and and you see a little league behind the sink and you say is just the little league just a little ... I don't see no water I don't see no war on my floor underneath the floor it's underneath the sub floor it's under these are are they going to the triple ... for\nIt it could be under the multiple layers so John and this particular case we ripped out all the cabinet our intention was to rip the for off the vinyl off and what we found underneath that was the ... I'm a quarter inch laminate okay inches ... which is the low on just to have the vinyl\nWhich ... if you use in something don't use ... but used finished ... pi\nNo wait wait John it was vinyl so all it was a very eight of of a level surface to surface because they had vinyl underneath that right so then underneath that vinyl then you had the plywood which was the original for which was a three aids or actually half inch plywood\nUnderneath that was the sub for which was sub par substandard and that was mould and mildew infested but you couldn't see any of this because in the basement they put a sheet rock ceiling across the top\nSo you couldn't see what was going on underneath the for when you when you pulled up that she'd underneath you saw all of the mold underneath the only thing that the ... there was a finished basement there was a finished\nSo of course in the finished basement they had insulation yes which held all the moisture so is is that a good thing or that I'm I'm I'm a I'm a big fan of never putting up drywall on your ceiling in your basement\nNever what about inflation and the rafters\nIf you have insulation on the walls you don't need it on the raft of or excuse me on the ceiling um yeah my fingers because the between the first and the second for the uh you don't need it now sound proofing yeah so that when people walk across the four upstairs or when you're down stairs in your basement watching a movie\nSo there's a reason for that because it creates the sound barrier to try to muscle the noise if you're wide screen TV that you're building your man cave off\nYou're going to be ... stereos and bar and I'm Sorry\nIs it sounds as a soundproof insulation of ... an art value insulation yes\nThose sound proving we'll give you our value as well um you know you can you can use all of the different ... you know reasoning for sound proofing and of course with a hard five aids board and use it actually believe it or not a double five eight ... you can actually\nCreate even more sound proof and you know your own house but insulation double five aids that can create a huge sound proving effective you're doing um for example home theater systems\nWhere you have to create and if you turn that volume up that's going to reverberate right through the entire house so depending on where you position this again anyone could put in a sixty five inch television yes but if you don't know how that television is going to interact with the speakers the wiring\nThe ruins next door that's where the biggest problem ...\nWhile the vibration and the act when in or what not out of the sound system\nSo I had a give you a perfect example I had my met with a husband and wife they wanted to finish their basement and the husband says I Want the television right here\nAnd of course I looked at this and I said OK you put the television there who's going to watch TV says I'm going to come watch every single football game and she goes I'm not going to be there I go to bed I don't care her bedroom was right above the TV [laughter] and\nWhen I said to him [laughter] he's got to turn the volume up\nBecause you know most of us men are deaf and we don't hear right right okay so guess what she's like oh you're not putting the television they're moving across the room and of course it was nowhere near and made any kind of sense but it\nBut she says if you don't sound proof it I don't want it and that automatically change the entire scope because it they didn't take into consideration all of the other things that go wrong in the house we got and that's where we got to deal with\nWe got five minutes left to show give us a call an eight hundred three three one night for night six eight hundred three three one Ninety four nights\nWe gave a potpourri of information today you know hey we're here I'm here for the next two more weeks yes so if you have any questions you can ... you can email us at H.

I'm John ... thanks for listening and we'll see you next week\nAbused or opinions of news radio five sixty I hearts media or management or employees to use radio I think\nThis\nIs news radio five eighty and Ninety four point nine ... W E a G n double duty ADHD forester and I urge radio station\nNot broken I'm Pam who sells Fox News warmer false names from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell who admits that Senate hit a low point during its bruising partisan battle leading up to ... Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct\nAble to save or we weren't able to uh accumulated in terms of retirement savings or not so to really be able to focus in on the picture\nWe're always looking at different ways to try to maximize your income sources either between Social Security between pensions between retirement savings and that sort\nAnd why we find at least for our clients uh to really help them build that peace of mind it's critically important to them to not just have an investment plan and and just have that investment plan really be dictating their income\nBecause yes we can look at projections about how do we really know what the earnings are going to be so how do we really know what we can safely drawer out of those accounts so we just look as our process here is we just looked to break that down into two separate plans to separate components and say\nWell let's look at and let's secure the income component first and create an income plan\nAnd secondly right behind that will be that investment plan to be there to support the income plan\nAnd by doing it in that particular manner again for our clients we find that that builds in more of that peace of mind well we can build in some certainty at least to the income component of their overall plan\nAnd I know a ... ... if you're a regular listener to the program uh you've ... I think you've had three or four different scenarios with clients um\nEspecially clients either who had a a word I had a deceased a spouse\nOr a ex wives or something like that um and the difference of of not taking action and and taking advantage of animal in a column loopholes they're just the way the system is not taking advantage of these things when you can\nUh can really result in the hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of your Social Security draw\nAbsolutely ... and when we look at those type of scenario is that\nThat is money that if you don't know is available to you right then and there then that's money that you're going to leave on the table and you're not going to be able to go back and get that there's very few there's very limited opportunities\nDepending on certain types of benefits were maybe you can go back up to six months retroactive but other than that\nThat's going to be money that you're going to leave on the table or so you just want to know what the rules are in terms of\nCan I Am I only able just to take my benefit or can I may be piggyback off of a spouse or off of an ex spouse or off of a survivor benefit\nTo allow my benefit the increase to a later point and then switch over to my benefit you know all these a source of strategies that are available we just want to know does it make sense for me to do it and if I Do do that what's the impact me now and what's the impact me later on\nSo as you're approaching a thinking about retirement and starting to take your ... Social Security benefits that's the time to really start researching rather than just jumping in and starting to get your benefits and then turn around six months in and you know be looking backwards\nAbsolutely and that's why we're big proponents of and we talk about\nIf you have time on your side and you're able to develop that plan three five plus years ahead of retirement where we can look at and we can forecast the Social Security projections and we can analyze that and we can take a look at your overall structure\nThen that's going to allow you to know sooner than later\nHey listen this is how you know we can kind of put a plan in place and say well this may be how we want to go about electing Social Security we can plug this benefit and hair and this benefit in there that switch over to this benefit later or\nHey you know what maybe because you're going to retire early maybe it makes sense for you to start right away because maybe you're going to draw down too much already a savings until that later point that we thought may make sense for you so\nIt's going to put you in a much better position to your point is that rather than kind of waiting until the last minute and then saying\nOh but you know a crappy [laughter] I didn't realize this was available I could have been collecting you know forty fifty thousand dollars up to this point\nAnd guess what I left out on the table so you know would you would you rather than fifty thousand in your pocket or would you rather live in a you know what the government from that standpoint so those are the issues that we want to know and be able to address up front just so we have an idea of what the possibilities are\nAnd with that said uh one of the reasons we've spent the last couple of programs talking Social Security is that ah we're in the middle of their Social Security workshops the disparate groups workshops for free and we've got a two left coming up\nWe do we have two more coming up which would be a this Wednesday and Thursday October tenth and October eleventh\nUh actually the one on Wednesday the tense is is already booked up that one is full so we do not have any space available uh unfortunately for the tenth\nSo sorry about that one out of a ... probably not going to be too happy with not a one on Thursday October eleventh uh six thirty PM at the beach would hotel or here in Worcester is the last one of the season so\nIf somebody would like to get a little bit more information or perhaps even make a reservation\nThan they can check us out at the Web site at my retirement security dot com or they could even call the office to make a reservation and you can reach us at age seven seven\nFour to one six seven zero zero\nAnd one thing that we'd like to stress to this is a no obligation it's a free seminar oh you don't need to bring anything maybe a notepad to to jot down some things but it's educational and there's no sales pitch\nNo none of none at all and what we do is up as this uh the workshop is really designed to be an educational experience\nThe workshop will run about an hour and a half to an hour and forty five minutes depending on questions than answers [noise]\nUh we do it in that format we do ah actually supplied people with some notes Xi on there that don't have a a guy's neck of memory but we do that for the reason being is we try to put a lot of information into ... the workshop like I said in an hour and a half to an hour and forty five minutes so\nWhat we do not do is we don't take questions on the fly during the workshop but what friday night do do is we stay on as long as people want us to after the workshop to answer any questions so\nThat's why you know come take advantage of the free information asking questions whether it's generic questions personal questions whatever it may be and we'd be more than happy to answer\nThose and that would apply even if you're ... several years out from retirement as well correct\nAbsolutely so we get age ranges of people in their late fifties to up into their early seventies that are there just to see you know what opportunities there may be for them\nThey're talking about might be [laughter] All right so just about ready for our first break here you are listening to retirement security with attorney Jeff ... from the disparate group we shall return

peripheral\nTo retirement security our weekly visit with Jeff month fat attorney Jeff months that from the disparate group they are retirement planning specialist here in the greater Worcester area they've been doing this now twenty three years they take a solutions based approach\nTo provide the worry free retirement scenario for him and one of the things that we mentioned frequently during the show a which is it really true especially when it comes to individual financial situations one size does not fit all so some of the things we talked about may not necessarily apply to your situation\n... absolutely is that because oftentimes we find is that you know especially in regards to Social Security is is most people don't fit into kind of one\nExtreme or another meaning delay as long as possible or take as early as possible most people are gonna fall somewhere in between and that's really what we try to stress at the workshops and and when we sit down with folks is really what we're looking for is always to take Social Security\nThat optimal for you and we really put the emphasis on for you because each individual circumstances is going to be different it's\nYou know you're going to continue to work a water the income needs what are the health concerns what's life expectancy all these different things come into play to figure out when the optimal time as for each individual family so\nCertainly by no means is that going to be a cookie cutter approach just say okay I'll Try to fit everyone into one particular profile so\nThat's why it's really important to do that type of homework\nAnd really back into it in other words you know let's do the homework first and let's figure out a from a budget standpoint what it is you're going to need to live whatever lifestyle it is that you're going to want to live in retirement [noise]\nLet's see what sources of income do you have coming in between pensions and Social Security and yes some rental income or whatever other types of ...\nThat you have coming in\nAnd then let's see what the potential shortfall is going to be between what you have in what you need and then that really helps us kind of back in because again what we're trying to do is find different ways of\nBeing able to maximize the Social Security benefits and pension benefits to be covering as much of your income needs as possible thereby freeing up more of your other savings to go do and use as you want to in retirement and not necessarily have to keep them held hostage\nFor your income requirements [noise] one thing is I just realized that uh I haven't heard you mention that I'm not even sure as germane to our conversation here how does how does disability figure into Social Security is it are the two separate things or do they ever affect each other\n[noise] um ... they are two separate things but again they're kind of considered one if if if that makes ... let me kind of explain that the um\n[noise] so what happens is if someone is eligible to receive a Social Security disability payments\nTypically that payment is going to be fairly close to their projected full retirement age benefits so let's take an example of somebody who is age sixty uh they qualified for Social Security disability\nSo it's going to happen is their Social Security disability payment is going to be close to or if not equal to their age sixty six Social Security pension benefit\nSo it's going to happen is between age sixty and age sixty six that monthly check is coming in from Social Security disability\nOnce they hit sixty six it's a seamless transition and then that check is coming in from Social Security retirement so yes the kind of looked at separately but it's kind of one pot where you're going to get the same amount but it's just\nWho is kind of making the checks and where those checks coming\nSo what is that um and this is a assuming that you're in unable to work correct um but uh when so when you make crust that threshold\nOr does is that a fixed age sixty six threshold for that scenario for going from disability to correct yeah OK\n... the only a possible increases are your cost of living adjustments yeah the way you know\nSo even if you are told social secure while I was hoping to work beyond sixty six can I still get the disability\nAnd well it's it's ... you have to qualify for up so there's a it's a means tested program so in other words you know you have to qualify a doctor has to sign off that you're you know because of whatever it is the disability that you're dealing with your otherwise not able to work\nBut you you know there are some opportunities for you to continue to work and you can earn up to certain amounts and still maintain your Social Security disability benefit\nAh but you have to qualify in other words you have to have work five auto last ten years and you know so there's you know you can't just kind of ... and you know if you don't have an earnings history and and try to qualify this other types of benefits that may step in for that but\nYes a lot of times we have to be looking at the Social Security disability and Social Security retirement as one in the same because some of the strategies and some of the planning opportunities that we have\nAre the same for the disability and for the retirement benefit I guess in terms of spouse or versus the pendant benefits and and so on and so forth so we really have to make sure that we're you know working hand in hand with both types of\nBenefits [laughter] okay so we've kind of a recap too we talked about the previous couple of shows will tell you about the free Social Security workshop that's coming up this week with the disparate group to and just a couple of minutes or what do we need to touch on now I realize that uh uh this book is rather thick or a lot of page\nAs it is you know and that's why\nWe don't ever try to attempt to get through all the different nuances and we try to just hit the main points and just know that you know if people can grasp the concepts and know what's available then hey you know we're going to put them in a better position to make the right decisions for themselves so [noise]\nUh last segment what we were talking about was you know what happens if you apply early for benefits well you're going to get a reduced benefits but on the flip side what we want to talk about is you know what happens if you delay taking your Social Security benefit beyond your full retirement age\nSo again if we take used up who has a full retirement age of sixty six",
