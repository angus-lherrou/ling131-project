NPR News Nairobi\nWhile we're on the subject of cheesy um horsing around the show that Bo jak start in had a theme song\nAnd not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explain the premise of the show yeah and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about so I thought we could listen to the theme song [noise]\n\nSo that's the theme song for the show within a show on both jak horsemen I'm so why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not bother tour theme song so much in this day and age but it does feel like a staple of those shows like the Brady Bunch of the perfect example of okay so you're just tuning in here is the premise of the show this was who these characters are this is how it works\nUm and it felt like a really fun way in like I thought if you heard this song you would immediately know what kind of show their says\nSince bow jak as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed\nYou're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that an influence at all and he too like the bow jak horsemen series within the serious horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained the premise of the show that he was a ... horse\nI you know I have seen a little Mr Right it is a slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age is that when I stayed home sick from school I didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have\nA bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience um and certainly part of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed like behind the scenes right what [laughter] when Mr Ed goes home after [laughter] and we see on ... and that was helpful way to do that series\nWhen I first started watching bow jak I thought oh this is such a funny show about the tropes of popular culture\nAnd then like the deeper I got into it I thought like wow there's some really late emotionally upsetting things that happen in this [noise] you know ... is an alcoholic he's mean effects this has this ongoing monologue self destructive monologue in his head about\nHow much she hates himself and how ... how much he knows he's always doing the wrong thing\nAnd so what he does is is drink more intense things sometimes get like really dark and at the risk of I'm giving something away from an earlier season\nI'll say that Sarah Palin who is the actress who plays the jak daughter adopted daughter ... sitcom horsing around um after she gets out of rehab years later and he invited her\nTo get high which he should never have done she just got out of rehab [noise] she ended up oh dean at you know toward the end of the episode and it's it's kind of shocking I mean you know it's a comedy it's animated but you really emotionally unprepared for that [noise]\nYeah I think the the the pitch for the show you know what I went into Netflix\nWas always that it's going to start like your typical animated comedy and it's going to feel like as you're watching it like oh I get this I get what it is and over the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more\nAnd and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first season you're thinking oh my God I care about these characters weight went\nUp and they they tricked me um and so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark or melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and its brightened colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack and just sadness and said in some fun ways [laughter] some of our northern Iraq like that's the kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter] [noise] so in this era\nOf the me too movement were so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is\nDo we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the freebies the we for your watch\nOr but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of like swing back into the limelight or we wanted to satirized bad and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving I don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new\nUm so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news\nWhen in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for\nYears and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not\nYou know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guest is Rafi ...
