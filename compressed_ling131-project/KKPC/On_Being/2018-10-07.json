they were\nYou know forty or over and oh my God we better you know ... uh you know they were arriving late to the table\nSo a spoiler on how many children do you have children I Do I have an eight year old who's almost nine is that near to him the film was dedicated it is [laughter] okay and you can read at eyes [laughter] before we always think nobody is going to say that because the very\nVery end like right before you know thinking New York state for letting a shoot here like no one's sticking around for that\nDo you mind me asking if you adopted if you did I have yes\nWe did do we actually were pursuing not unlike the characters in the movie all the sort of differently\nWe were pursuing international adoption\nAnd I've yet to simultaneously um and ah yeah we were doing those things at the same time it was kind of like whatever happens first wins and an IV F. one and we got pregnant and finally had mia Taylor who was my daughter so the movie starts\nWith the Catherine on character\nOn her bed in her bikini underwear lying on her hip it's a kind of sexy pose but what really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the hormone is that she's getting at that moment and it's a great shot to show\nHow what should be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving when you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and pills and you know all this stuff that's like\nNot only not sexy but it also kind of is going to have an effect on your body because you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes yeah um and I said can you talk about that shot can you talk about like\nFraming it as something that looks like it's going to be really sexual erotic it's not [laughter]\nAnd there's also sounds so before you you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of whisper voice and she sang screwed over and you're hearing breath and it sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Katherine slower hunch\nUm you don't see any heads or it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bad and then Paul arrives above her and pulls her underpants down a little bit to expose sort of her\nHunch and you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act because there's all this preparation and instead he\nLifts up a hyper during the MEK needle and an interim muscular needle and you know spears and into her but\nAnd then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation\nAnd and to compare it to say pregnancy like instead of\nThe has been putting his hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her with needles in her belly and her\nAnd her head and I'm ... ... ... again it's just it's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having\nA baby in that kind of be like it can lead ride that moment but that\nProcess is just so so different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination who you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in the stir ups [laughter] and if we're ...\nA clinic from the point of view Catherine ... figure skating the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of you out of use so many women have had so many times [laughter] [noise]\nUm yeah and um I actually um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your experience\nI actually had great Dr ... it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ...\nAnd uh he it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the captain Han character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her her agent calls her and said have you seen the cover\nAnd Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs to her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of Catherine has a feminist and the character and and in the novel\nA undercover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as they're attacking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nSo solar trade for what\nCollege is sending its ideology ally that I didn't\nHave a career in in their hand out to send them the bills for Iowa is an idea for\nSecond wave feminism for our ambivalent about having to [noise]\nDon't know you're not because you realize that the voters lists\nBefore each of changing the deadline is remember

writing my stupid [noise]\nI didn't say that\nMy advanced maternal age my old eggs in one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm it's like [noise] on a sabbatical\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa what so suppose not hey\nSo that was Catherine ... and Paul Giamatti and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life so did\nYou have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself\nYeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my ... and get her on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was\nI think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her\nI mean it's such a demented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's butter and this was in like I have a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is\nWhat's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels\nBetrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a licensed to pursue your\nAh to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um\nDelayed is now possibly not available to her\nI guess the camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which is currently in theaters and streaming

crowd and calls for at least to join him on stage which he does reluctantly\nIt's one of those scenes in which the musicians don't know the song but as they play along they get it hey this is good well alley melts the hearts of everyone on her\nYes the performance goes viral\nEven if you normally roll your eyes at stuff like this it's hard to resist the camera is handheld and mostly at I live with the characters breathless we worship ... that intimate than worship all\nThere's a reason that a star is born has been made four times it's a Cinderella story in which the prince\nValidates everything good about an impoverished young woman he makes her a princess and then garish self destruct before her horrified eyes a rescue fantasy Adam masochistic wallow in one neat package\nI Can't imagine how the first half of this a star is born could be much better it's so good it will carry people through the second test which has great scenes but the usual mushy arc Cooper and his co

Kilian brick becomes alleys manager and steers her towards bland dance pop\nYou can't tell what Eli thinks about the song she's doing\nAnd there's no point when Lady Gaga breaks through and shows the subversive ... that made her a star yes she's playing a character but why catcher and then keep straight jacket it she all but drops out of the picture well Jackson hits bottom after bottom\nCooper's performance scripts you though even behind a full beard long hair and to squint it took me a few seconds to place his bath soap per then I thought of course it's Sam Eliot\nThen Eliot showed up as Jackson's much older brother and long suffering caretaker and it's a trip hearing them growl at each other in the same voice\nThe most shocking scene in all versions of a star is born takes place at an award ceremony the Oscars or Grammys in this case the Grammys this one tops them all in the humiliation department it's excruciating\nTowards the end of the movie I heard sniffles and knows is being blown all over the theater men this material is shameless and man does it work\nWhatever its lapses a star is born will be a monster hit audiences will love Cooper for his tender suffering on screen\nAnd for showing us the soul that was always there beneath Lady Gaga is outrageous costumes they'll want to seek ... at the Oscars as much as fans in the movie want to see alley at the

first approached them about the idea of this kind of story actually look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this or a big powerful company\nUm and I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nAnd ah as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm
