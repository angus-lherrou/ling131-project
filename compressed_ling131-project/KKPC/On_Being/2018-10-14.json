Colorado Public radio is here for Colorado\n\nLive from NPR News in Culver City California I'm Barbara Klein\nTens of thousands of people in the Florida Panhandle are still without power for days after hurricane Michael made landfall at the same time NPR's Joel Rose reports relief workers are busy delivering badly needed aid to hard hit communities\nMerging the officials to set up food and water distribution points in and around Panama City and regular people from the surrounding towns volunteered to deliver aid as well Lionel James brought a truck full of supplies from Destin, Florida\nWater diapers solid food all that stuff I Know how long it takes for people to get stuff and I know the dangers of this and what's going on\nThere were long lines for food water and gas not only near the coast but also in rural inland areas that were hard hit by the storm and there may be more difficult for relief workers to reach Joel Rose NPR News Panama City Florida\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida says Congress may have to revise us Saudi relations if the kingdom is found to be responsible for the murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal quiz show gate\nThe Saudi critic has been missing ever since he entered the Saudi consulate in ... earlier this month and is believed to be dead Rubio tells NBC's Meet the press the U.S needs to take a stand\nAnd if this had happened in Saudi Arabia would still be outrageous but that's different from saying in a third country not Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic facility you're going to walk in and then they're going to do that too I mean that that's that would be something we never seen before certainly from a country that's on our\nRubio says the U.S may have to reconsider a multibillion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia one President Trump says he wants to preserve Trump has threatened to severely punished Riyadh a threat the kingdom rejected today\nThe Taliban say they've met with a senior U.S envoy to discuss an end to Afghanistan Seventeen year long war NPR's DEA Habib reports a spokesman for the insurgents says they met in the Gulf state of Qatar\nThe Taliban spokesman said in a statement that their political negotiating team that was on my ... odd his Washington special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation\nThere was no immediate comment from Washington it's ready for the thoughts of discussions to be declaring publicly and it was unclear if the talks could develop further despite Washington's newfound drive to negotiate an end to the war\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of hit me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nAnd I think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nA and also you know the family is I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet with Jan and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about disappeared in their life\nAnd just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to a family where you're trying to raise kids you know it it Neal's case to you know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York it asked her fee in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash including the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did did that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you could find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster was sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a a\nDuring Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual sort of format and paper um that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent of that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to remind people off\nMy guest is ... inches out he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and we'll hear from Adam calling this

fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross ... he wrote and directed whiplash ... land and he directed the new film\nFirst manned starring Ryan Gosling is Neil Armstrong the astronaut who commanded the Apollo eleven first manned spacecraft to land on the moon on July twentieth Nineteen sixty nine I'm starting became the first human to walk on them are\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with\nI'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married I think for thirty six years and then I'm divorced\nWhat were some I think he's learned from her that help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire foie and light Armstrong we're going shrewd during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal and Janet had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval\nYou know it was something in their character is sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had that also you know it was very much a product of of of their time in their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to ... you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know you're you're you're moving from place to place to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot the ex Fifteen and he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she\nWould uh several times just look at me and an almost with a shrug say well sink or swim that really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way but of course as complicated as that and uh you\nKnow so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities in instances that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet or you know late in the film or a insists to her husband that he sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon mission sits down and tells them that he may not return\nIt made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded in Jim Hansen's book I'm beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from what she wrecked elected and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie wreck elected\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his sons saying I might not make it that that she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet to see that\nAnd he has been in this incredible like low key way without really\nThat really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a or at least the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nI Want to play the title song on the final album that was released when your father Leonard Cohen was still alive it's called you want a darker and then we'll talk about working with him on it and this is it's what can I say it's a great song [noise]\nIf you wish you [noise] if scientists to [noise] ... [noise] you want us to talk [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAh [noise]\nMeasurement for [noise]\nA million candles preparing for [noise]\n\n\nAs Leonard calling from the final album that was released while he was alive the title track\nYou want a darker I guess just his son Adam ... wrote the introduction to a new collection of ... final homes ... lyrics and drawings called the flame\nThat China so much about facing death ended up having a God who allows suffering and accepting the suffering but yet not being like happy about it or trying to make it seem like sufferings great [laughter] you know you're not trying to be\nSpiritual and dismissive way of of all the suffering that we indoor\n[noise] um I I Want to read what he wrote about you for the liner notes of this album he wrote that without your contribution there would be no record he said at a certain point\nAfter over a year of intense labor both pat\nWho wrote the melodies and I coincidentally broke down with severe back injuries and other disagreeable visitations\nIn my case the situation was bleak the discomfort acute and the project was abandoned Adam sense that my recovery if not my survival\nDepended on my getting back to work he took over the project establish me in a medical chair to sing and brought these unfinished songs to completion preserving of course many of pets hunting musical seems\nAnd it's because of my sons loving encouragement and skilled administration that the sun's exist in their presence form I cannot think enough\nWhat were you able to do for him physically to make it possible for him to record the album he mentions you put him in a medical ... can you describe to set up that that you helped create for him\nI think maybe the more interesting things certainly to me would be to to just say that\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire mission and of course it had to do with a serious health issues he was in mobilized you had a multiple compression fractures\nOf his spine and it involved an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last ... but\nShe invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nYou know like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspelled tracks their subjects because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd ... their regurgitate ing things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nMy guest is songwriter singer Adam Cohen is the

you want it darker Leonard Cohen was very weak and in pain when he recorded it\nIs their son you remember 'em from your childhood\nThat sticks in your mind is on that meant a lot to ... maybe even a song you remember your father writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah\nYou remember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nSo you know started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was no one string guitar in his underwear\nAnd they're always be versus to consult and I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time I didn't want to put out\nIsn't it amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know we lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you buy those to to buy that unlikely union\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to and to my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah as you say there's ... there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four but did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because\nOf dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that time\nAs the popular a poem states of tone is never finished but rather abandoned\n[laughter] do you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think frustration was expected um ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as if he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew\nTo black and pages and uh and gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised Norma some out or go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patients and my family my master piece on signed\nYou know you call it that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought desk thought and that's often attributed to I'm One of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter] yeah he he edited and take it he edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city":
