the most pro putting pro Russia congressman in Washington DC his district was actually won by ... by two points in twenty sixteen he's being challenged by a local businessman so it's one of those key races in Los Angeles suburb that will show us whether this trend is\nDefinitive the local business when used to be a Republican himself right and so like there he may arguably have some bipartisan appeal\nRight and polls show that race is super\nClose if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow we're focusing on the race for the house of representatives with NPR's Dominican months' narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak the medical take me to the future of you and I sitting in the studio an election night where the cabs have your browser will be open to\nYou know I'm old school I don't even have the browsers I use paper and I've got my list here or that and because I'm political editor I Am going to take some liberty\nZoom out and grab a bunch of races in one big bucket on the phone on the Internet on it and everybody subtle and here we go this is the Obama Trump\nDistricts okay from other I'm about to Trump right these are districts that President Obama won in twenty twelve but President Trump wound up winning twenty sixteen I can talk about all these races but I Want to talk about where they are because it's really indicative of how well Trump did and uh what Democrats need to do to win the house\nOr on election day or for Republicans to hold it most of these places are either in the Midwest and if you look at at all of them globally\nThere in New York and New Jersey the ... the Philadelphia suburbs uh all the way up through upstate New York a lot of these districts there's one that's uh just outside St Louis on the Illinois size you look at all of those places\nAnd I to me you know if Democrats can do well in the half a dozen or so tossup races that are within this Obama Trump bucket then they probably take back the house\nFun fact three out of four Iowa districts therefore I Would districts three of them were Obama Trump districts and two of them are pretty close tossup races\nRight now no part of that might have to do with the even this of redistricting but that's a conversation for another\nPhone to put a shot for Iowa out there that's off a I'm going to go with Amy McGrath in Kentucky sixth district she is running against anti bar he a as a Republican to foresee the Democrat or not this is a district that has been pretty hardcore Republican Trump won it by Fifteen points\nBut any McGrath is a marine veteran and she is one also one of those democratic women candidates that has gained a lot of prominence on the national stage\nOne of many uh one of many women veterans running on the Democratic side this time\nYes absolutely I mean we have quite a few ... at least historically speaking women combat vets running for Congress she raised three times what Andy Barr did and the third quarter this year and part of what I'm watching is first of all if she can flip this kind of a district that's really stunning\nBut I'm also watching a lot of these combat vets because what we do know from pulling it is that voters tend to give women and democratic women perhaps especially\n... much less of an edge on things like national security and so on as they might give her Republican man and so this is sort of a test case for that\nSo we've been saying all along that the Democrats are feeling confident that they can take control of the house but of course we don't know what's going to happen on election day we taught for on the show about the legislative stakes what could Congress do\nNext year depending on who's in charge what are the political stakes what does it mean to the Democratic party if it at the end of the day they don't we take control the house and for the second election cycle in a row they've they've missed their mark and and and they've\nLost it'd be an earthquake within the Democratic party no question about it you know right now there's a lot of younger democratic activists who are quietly talking about the fact that the leadership within the Democratic party in their seventies and if the party doesn't if the Democrats aren't able to take back the house\nThen they're going they're going to be a lot of questions to ask about who that leadership will be\nIntense tick the flip side of that if Republicans somehow keep control of the house of representatives what are Republicans talking about the next day\nWell the president has a alluded to more tax relief for middle income Americans um uh in in on the left ... there's going to be a lot of questions on the blame game like who's responsible you know much like what happened with Republicans\nAfter Mitt Romney lost and twenty twelve whether they'll put together some sort of introspective autopsy of what happened during this election\nWe know one thing is for sure if Republicans hold the house they will not pump the brakes they're going to be stepping on the gas or an exclamation point\nNPR's the minute come on to narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak thanks everybody thinking You're welcome in medical stick with us because now it is time for race of the week\nRunning against these people need your help we will never die down by and if we [noise]\nWeek we focus on one race that tells us something about the broader election and this week we're looking at the governor's race in Georgia the medical ... you're still with me\nHas it gone there were gonna bring in Johnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. in Atlanta Johnny hello so the medical let's start with you who are the candidates\nAnd the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression of who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is\nThat Kevin Abrams has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the selection comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nYou this has drawn a federal lawsuit a temp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as camp likes to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning up the Georgia flag back in the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial divisiveness that was embedded in the state five with that Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of those state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race my big question\nRight now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections Abrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut camp has done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nDays even he could be spending tax rating liberal she's an extreme even campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe a more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand that he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. Johnny thanks so much for talking to us yeah thanks for having me this is the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\nCan just tell you that you know how often pull polling exactly what you do not see the numbers zero\nZero zero percent of democratic but it's so that surprise me but getting to what's important nine and ten Republican men and women say yeah I'm going to vote Republican independence\nIndependent men prefer the Republican by two percentage points which is to say roughly evenly split independent women prefer the Democrats by twenty three percentage points so once again when you're looking at the gender gap that is where it's\nGoing to look at unmarried women look at white college educated women they are really driving a lot of the election and the opposition to President Trump\nSo last question on this ah what were the\nIssues that that voters seem to be most motivated by\nWell you know the one saving grace for President Trump here is that the economy and jobs continue to rate as the top issue for a for people now it's not a huge percentage of people but it's it's the the largest number of what's asked here and when you look at a second is healthcare third is immigration\nBut the divide between the parties are two completely different universes soup parties living Democrats have been blanketing the airwaves with health care ads they're running healthcare healthcare healthcare everywhere\nDemocrats believe that's the top issue followed by the way by climate change Republicans see jobs in the economy has topped with immigration as not too far behind which explains President Trump's attempts at trying to wrap up the base and talking about immigration and this caravan coming from Central America\nAnd funny you should mention that because later in the show Danielle and I will have a long conversation about health care with NPR's Scott Horsley looking at how it's played out of the campaign but more importantly what the actual\nVotes have done or would have done and what the Trump Administration has done on Obamacare as later on the show right Danielle Kurtzleben ... thank you so much thank you You're welcome [noise]\nVisit the politics you from NPR I'm Scott Detrow feels like there's always a few major stories that dominate the headlines one\nPerson is now in federal custody after a nationwide bomb scare\nThe generally international outrage over the killing of a Washington Post columnist has the Trump Administration\nOf the United states calling a growing caravan of Central American migrants a national emergency\nAnd because of that other really important stories often get overlooked so every week we take a few minutes to focus in on one story that didn't get that much attention this week\nAnd to do that we always have NPR's Ron Elving all around good to be with who's got some it's everything else that happened this week President Trump signed a sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become the worst health crisis in this country and many years and you know it's hard to think\nOf another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same are reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths [noise]\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids so the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least making extremely big dent in this terrible terrible problem\nSo what are some specific things that this law does one\nOf the factors cited in recent successes with controlling this scourge\nHas been access to Medicaid coverage\nWhich was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addictions\nAt back to the creation of comprehensive opioid recovery centers tries to address the over prescription of opioids and in many doctors appear to be getting the message on this\nUh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies additional measures including new enforcements drinks for the United States Postal service so but they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids\nThis bill us signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be\nLeveling off yes that came from Alex those are the secretary of the department of health and Human Services\nOr data for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate\nThat the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years\nHe used the word plateau and that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year and twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand\nFrom sixty four thousand the previous year\nA new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in last month's of Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen\nSo if anything the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing\nAnd that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this was the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together\nPeople saying look what we need here as a to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just stitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche good intentions\nAre that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on

Republicans found one of their best talking for the used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing it we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has ... Haile of Obamacare failed by a single voter away today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine fifty one\nNow is a Democrat to feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about healthcare all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "27"}
