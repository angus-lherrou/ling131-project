Taliban continues to wage attacks around fourteen thousand American troops remain in the country as part of NATO's mission to train Afghanistan's own security forces\nThat's down from a peak of more than one hundred thousand President Trump has said ground conditions and not timetables will determine when the U.S leaves Amy held NPR News\nShe also seemed to almost put some salt in the wound of folks would hope that she would oppose Kavanaugh by saying the Kavanaugh actually you know voted a lot with Merrick Garland you remember America and the\nObama nominee who never got a hearing in the Senate um those two things really jumped out at me and actually the whole speech if you read eighty Ninety percent of it on its own you could almost imagine Mitch McConnell delivering a speech like that either\nTo me it was how long the speech was how in depth that was it didn't seem like this was like oh well I guess I'll vote yet but it's I'm very reluctant this was a full throated endorsement of him and when you talk about the way that she talked about a Christine Blasey Ford yeah\nUh she said that she believed that something happened to our but nevertheless she felt like it hadn't been corroborated and so it it was a way that I think that she was trying to thread the needle to say that we believe women they should be heard but uh\nShe's still raise questions about it well let's step back and talk about what we think that could mean for the midterms because you're right Collins says me to Israel it matters is long overdue but then she poked so many holes and what Ford said\nThat this is not a criminal trial but there's a there's basic fairness and and if you if you want to take allegations seriously they should at least meet a threshold of more likely than not indicating Ford's testimony was on the or not side\nWell I think this kind of lands on something that I've been hearing from Republicans for several days and we haven't heard Jeff Flake kind of articulate this a little bit as he was doing his tour of bipartisanship with ah Chris Coons of Delaware let ... earlier this week\nThe fact of the matter is these Republicans are saying that they are conservatives that the judicial philosophy and the you know the entire background of cabinet sits with their political beliefs\nSo there's that one bucket of this conversation but then there's something separate happening here that is not specifically political that has to do with me too movement with the allegations\nOf sexual assault and sexual misconduct and they had to find a way to separate the two and make a vote about their political beliefs because at the end of the day they think their political beliefs or what is going to carry them through future elections\nSomething really remarkable here is that Kavanaugh's nomination\nCame almost one near to the day from those initial articles about Harvey Weinstein that really kicked off the me too movement and the the big question that I have is is is what is the lasting impact of this last week this day long gut wrenching testimony now and and\nChristine Blasey Ford said that she was reluctant to come forward because she was worried it wouldn't matter in the end and now Brett Kavanaugh still goes to the Supreme Court anyway so what does that do what does that do for for women all across the country who saw Argo through that who maybe had a similar experience in her life\nAnd and have a C and this is the combination of a year long national conversation about how we take allegations seriously or not\nI don't think that it ends here at all I don't think that it can and I think some people who support of Kavanaugh tend to have kind of and colon seem to argue he'll get on the court and everyone will kind of come together and everything will be better\nAnd I just I I don't think that we see any evidence of that I think that the divisions in this country\nSeems to be real and seem to be hardening not you know I I don't see him getting confirmed in all of these people who have been so passionate who've been protesting who've been talking about uh the sexual assaults that they've been through I don't see that just fading away it seems like it would make people even more passionate\nIf we're talking about the energy that might come off of this event you can already feel it immediately after Joe Manchin a announced Hughes support for Brett Kavanaugh went outside in was confronted by a number of demonstrators who shouted him down as he tried to explain his [noise]\nAnd I [noise]\nIn arguing\nSo Kelsey you and I cover Congress this is just been such a weird process I mean it started off thinking wow this is going to be this ethic clash over the key swing vote\nThen it became over the summer it seemed like kind of a judge in terms of political interest in a done deal and then we spent the last month watching this visceral personal fight play out\nOn national television and radio I mean what do you think you're going to take away from all this\nI Am going to be really watching the way senators recover from this if they recover from this because it's very likely that they're going to leave town fairly shortly here to go finish campaigning for the midterms which is the only let's gosh just a little bit more than a month away\nAnd once they leave they're going to go back into an even more partisan environment where they're running for reelection or supporting other people running for reelection and then they have to come back here and keep the government open and have a fight about President Trump's demand for a wall on the border with Mexico\nAnd I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so\nAnd are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or does this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nYeah and and for me it's it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust him the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing Supreme Court of justice partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find that answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak affects everybody\nThanks glad to be here thanks\nThis is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the week\n[noise] running for United States Senate this against fifty seven color I Need your help we will never backed down from fight and if we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate red ... with us as well as the ... and Dominican so walk us through\nWhat race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and serve two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can yes wise I actually had met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump he told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning that his governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact\nWhen it comes to gender when it comes to race when it comes to so many different things one group gaining power means another girl losing power and and there is a real backlash I think that's\nHow politics has often been seen though right is this sort of zero sum game I think if one group gains another group is largely going to be disadvantaged and we've seen this time and again when it comes to issues around affirmative action right or immigration and indifferent sort of minority politics mission issues and we are seeing this now I I Would argue to some degree with\nConversations around gender I'm ... and again I think this is something that President Trump\nA very you could argue acutely very smartly politically smartly tapped into during the twenty sixteen election\nBecause it really galvanized people I mean I remember meeting a guy ... actually the summer\nWho was a huge Donald Trump supporter hadn't always voted Republican and instantly he started going into this frustration he had about safe spaces and how he feels like safe spaces says it's silly idea you know he he ... he's a welder he gets burned all day he has cut why do people need safe spaces\nAnd and this kind of talk I think get set the frustration that some people have which is that like\nWhy do you need to be so politically correct and I know that we've talked a lot about what exactly political correctness means but it's this frustration that they cannot say or behave the way that they had always said things are behaved\nAbout one place where uh you can basically say whatever your feeling is conservative talk radio um and I've been listening to a lot of it recently and there is that very strong feeling of\nVictimization that men that white men are the victims in this um and you know Rush Limbaugh has been talking about so called Fibonacci for you know a generation almost two great commercial success\nBut he is doing it again in light of the cabinet hearing and in some ways this has is reflecting a viewpoint that is very much out there it's not us up for it it's a it's a full on its occurred\nWere so out of balance here women activists seminars the women can demand all kinds of investigations into men men cannot require or demand investigations into women\nEven they were talking a lot about the enthusiasm that we're seeing among men head of the midterms\nI I think we have to sort of put that in perspective which is that the enthusiasm we are seeing among women it's somewhat unprecedented I mean I have not searched heard or seen this level of enthusiasm for women and women are telling me you know they have\nNever done anything beyond vote before and in an election and now they're knocking on doors they're canvassing they're protesting they're going to march it's I mean there's an extreme level of engagement among women and so even though we're talking about what's happening\nI'm On the other side of the spectrum I think that it's it's not happening in a vacuum\nRight it's also happening in contract and maybe you could argue because up some of the enthusiasm we're seeing\nFrom within and when we're talking about women here we're talking about democratic women and I mean that's\nAn interesting point because there are a lot of Republican women frankly who are leading the charge on saying that they feel like their husbands or their sons are somehow being treated unfairly this time\nAnd twenty sixteen we were talking about will you see this big shift of women voters to Hillary Clinton in response to President Trump's various scandals in statements and the answer was a pretty resounding no\nAnd it's true now too when we look at the polling that has not moved Republican women at all ... you may go\nMidterms are based elections typically and\nUntil recently one base was really super energize now both ... seem to be really super energize\nI guess one question is is this going to be a a super ... on steroids base election and and the other question is does this fate is this like a boom of enthusiasm\nThat you know if Republicans are the victors in this fight then maybe they fade out\nKnow look to us most point about the\nFact that women are fired up women have been fired up this entire time right I mean since President Trump was elected women have been fired up and their levels were already polling very high so what this issue was able to do is\nEven though democratic enthusiasm ... ticked up slightly since the summer it had a lot more room to grow for Republicans and Republicans have really struggled to find a single issue\nThat would fire up the base and this one seems to have done so and they were kind of surprised by that it does look like the at least the bet the Republicans are making is that this will be a base election because when you look at the enthusiasm numbers\nFor Latino as for young people for independence groups that right now are leaning towards Democrats energy core constituency democratic groups for this election\nThose are much lower and if that's the case than we are headed for kind of a train crash of a of a culture war in at the ballot box in November of base election so whereabouts\nAmong to election day right it's a very short amount of time but in the modern\nNews cycle that we live in a month is an eternity like five years\nWith Kavanaugh on his way to the Supreme Court do we think that that that may be Republican voters aren't so riled up because they got their guided gotten two Supreme Court justice said that's all we're a reason why a lot of Republicans voted for Donald Trump to begin with and\nThey kind of fade away again or do we think this has staying power\nMe if you're talking about psychology um the emotion of anger\nAnd fear is much stronger than the emotion of happiness you are less likely to remember the things that you're happy about the things that you are bitter about that said we just don't know whether this is you know the python eats the rabbit and it moves through quickly and it's\nThis big moment [laughter] of energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of liquor python and anger as them as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid next everybody you walk up\nYou're welcome [noise]\nVisit politics shell from NPR I'm Scott\nDetrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might have missed him to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran good to be with you it's got so some of the things we're going to talk about what had been big deals and other weeks but this week just\nNo room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also ah to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nA just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really big big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and know broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller okay\nShifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send to investors and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half a couple of the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple of right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences\nYou can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ten percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner\nThey're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics show from NPR Nike Ron using [noise]", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "06"}
