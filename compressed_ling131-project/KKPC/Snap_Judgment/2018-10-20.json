I think they that they that he certainly got some street cred within the local Democratic Party when he decided to vote against Kevin\nWell and I think that you know this was a guy who showed some independence in a lot of ways in that way in one but let's listen to one of his TV ads and I think you'll see why it sounds a whole lot different than some of the other Democrats across the country radical\nLeft wants to eliminate during my support on Monday President Trump's border wall extremes on the left and right I Want to cut defense spending I don't want our troops and verify I Want them to have to\nListen to that he says he supports the ice and he said that he supports President Trump's border wall how many Democrats across the country would say that that raise my eyebrows any quotes Ronald Reagan said he believes in peace through strength he also said no socialized medicine and know cutting the Affordable CARE Act now that the line to walk\nThat's right there's not a lot of time left before election day and I knew that we've all been talking about the ups and downs in this race but it's got what specifically are you looking for between now and November six that you think maybe could give us somewhat of a clue about what'll happen election day\nOne of the one of the biggest things that we saw this week was just the insane amount of money the Democratic candidates have had brought in house candidates all over the country bringing in\n... the the type of money that sometimes you see Senate can candidates bringing Senate candidates and ... or ... bringing in presidential campaign level numbers there is just a ton of donor enthusiasm on the Democratic side the candidates have a ton of money\nTo my question is what are they going to do with it at a certain point you can't buy more TV ads all the TV Time is taken up\nSo how do they use this money do they use it on on door knocking on get out the vote efforts do they use it on digital advertising I'm just really curious to see where that money goes and how they can leverage that advantage that they have because again the the divide between the party and fundraising was was really striking\nAnd also can they spend it in a way that lays down some permanent infrastructure for Democrats in states where they haven't had\nMuch of one yeah given it gives you something that you're really watching these last couple of weeks\nOkay look the fact is you're now starting to hear that turned out in this election could be a record could be as high as it's been since the mid Nineteen sixties another time of social and cultural upheaval I talked to Michael McDonald who's\nThe turnout expert at the University of Florida keeps the big turnout database that everybody looks at ... and he said that he's looking at essentially\nFor markers for indicators for why he thinks that turnout is going to be that high for mid term okay she said that there was record special election turnout high primary turnout a high degree of self reported interest in the election and high levels of early voting\nAnd we're seeing intensity and all of those metrics\nAbsolutely and he said when all four of those are pointing in one direction he said you know look it just seems to point to the fact that this is this could be an election that is higher turnout than most people have seen in their lifetimes perimeter\nAnd we should explain that even higher turnout ... somewhere between forty five fifty percent of the electorate voting and\nI'm watching the immigration debate\nI think that now that the Brett Kavanaugh moment has come and gone I'm not saying it didn't help Republicans get more energized but I Do think that Donald Trump is looking for another culture war issue that he can use to energize his base that's fascinating the caravan of\nPeople coming through Mexico from Central America on ... potentially on their way to the U.S border as something that he's been tweeting about I think that what we've seen is when the immigration debate focuses on border security\nUm or abolishing ice than Republicans when when the immigration debate focuses on taking kids away from their parents Democrats\nSo I'm watching that a caravan of potential immigrants to the U.S and seeing if it's going to blow up into a big issue before election\nDay that's really interesting and it's also an issue that I think makes Donald Trump feel very comfortable right like this is what he ran on well he's a culture warrior\nAnd immigration was his number one issue he wrote down the gold escalator and said Mexico was sending ... states\nImmigration is the one thing over the past decade that has fired up Republicans almost more than anything else including the Supreme Court [noise] All right that was NPR's Scott Detrow ... and Mara Liasson thank you all thank you You're welcome\n[noise] this\nIs a policy to show from NPR I must have a holiday it feels like every week there is wide and major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories I can get overlooked\nWe dive into one story this week they did not get a lot of attention and could do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week\nAs White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise in white matter is that he left\nThe bare bones of these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House Don McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney patched baloney or who is well known in Republican legal circles but while simple Donny is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and and in flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for a vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of this feels Harry insider eight to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in up pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that a fair assessment\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton card in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court an appeals court levels over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team it's part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been\nHandling much of the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nYet I mean you mentioned some of this is ... around gun control immigration neither cultural fishers Alice as a political reporter we got in the country we hear consistently from voters about these things but it sounds like you're saying they are just taking this and intensifying it in a in the social media spaces\nAbsolutely and some of the documents reference and that these court charges from friday talk about witch hunts and making fun of Iraq Obama making fun of the late ... Arizona Senator John McCain targeting politicians on both sides of the aisle for some of these kinds of rhetoric we've been hearing in political ads here in the U.S overtime\nAnd even things like the NFL protesting the anthem protests\nAnd interesting if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show for NPR I must have a holiday and I'm here in Studio with NPR's Carrie Johnson Ryan Lucas and Phil Ewing still can sense as\nAnd now that we know that this is happening at least in the the information space and what the U.S officials are doing and is this something that we've been you think of the country successfully able to combat that far when we're talking about the administration's\nResponse the government says that it wants to make the public aware about this as much as possible the FBI has launched a special website That's focused on public information campaigns the director of national intelligence Dan Coats other people at his level talk about this publicly much more than they used to\nBut the fact that are made clear in these court documents shows how much this continues to take place on social media on Facebook and Twitter especially and frankly what a bad job those two platforms have done\nIn scrapping these sorts of things these court papers are filled with examples of Russian influence mongers creating fake accounts\nPretending to be Americans and posting means about president ... the former president his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are ostensibly or the coverage of the Austin bombings that took place last year and how much\nThe media was ignoring them because the victims weren't white because they were black and Latino at the time and these as Ryan indicated are American controversy is taking place naturally in our own\nContext but the Russians are very skilled on social media and getting in there and trying to turn up the volume as much as they can so skilled\nThat there's actually some instructions quoted in these a court papers in this part of this Russian Campaign they're telling Russians listen if you want to target American liberals don't mention the site Breitbart and if you want to target American conservatives steer clear of mentioning buzzfeed\n[laughter] I don't know what they're doing [laughter]\nA little bit about what the social media platforms themselves they're doing with these tech giants are doing I knew our colleague Tim Mak\nDid spend some time at with Facebook just this past week and Facebook is sort of touting this election security war room that they've developed but I'm curious if any of you have a sense of how successful this is an because to some degree also you know the Russians and whoever it is just trying to interfere could ... just invent new tricks\nWhat the platform so focused on is transparency so they're responding in the way that the American political system has historically ah to campaign influence issues where if you buy an ad that says Obama is a part of the Muslim Brotherhood\nFacebook once you'd have to disclose who you are and thereby disclose the origins of that type of messaging so that will be in place for political campaigns going forward but in real time when you're scrolling through your Facebook feed\nWho's actually going to look at that and do the research and say oh this appears to be a foreign influence campaign if it's going to have an effect it's not going to stop the problem and it's not going to keep our information environment and the United states pristine in any way\nOn a slightly depression or one of the questions that I always like to ask a Social Security people when I when I meet with him and talk to them is are these sorts of operations is this just the sort of world that we live in now and\nReally there's no way to to and there is no way to combat those to the point where it's not going to be an issue and the depression answer that I generally get is this is pretty much the world we live enough\nTo constantly playing defense you can never really entirely fix the problem right you're just sort of trying to to blockade is that sort of a lack of yeah that's a good example is\nIt's a dilemma that counterterrorism professionals have talked about for many years because we have an open society we have freedom of movement we have freedom of speech you can go wherever you want within reason and in the old days we worried about terrorists exploiting that these days we're worried about foreign governments exporting that because they can move much more quickly than Facebook and Twitter can to clamp down on them\nAnd I'm the U.S government really has no way to stop that from taking place\nI got to tell you that as somebody who sometimes goes out in the world to speak at places other than Washington DC I Know that we have listeners who I teach high school and college history or American studies or social studies\nAnd at the high school and the college level\nThey are trying to educate people young people about how to recognize some of these phony mediums and information warfare attack to try to get out the problem that way before people start logging into Facebook and believing what everything that they read there's actually a real\nKind of effort at civics education out they're aimed at young folks to try to get them to recognize these things that are targeting them\nWhere they go and that's a wonderful but it's also it's like a generational struggle\nThat's it's going to take years and years to to get an educated voting populace that's conscious of such things\nJust to kind of wrap up the conversation here it sounds like the interference that we are seeing is is really just essentially on the information level the information and public face but it it's not really a matter of voting like if if I Am a vote or going to vote there's not a real threat to election security in that way it is that right\nAccording to what these national security agency said on friday they haven't identified any cyber attack that is going to result in a vote being changed as so if you go to the polls and you try to vote for your member of Congress what the government is saying if they don't have any evidence that that vote will not be counted as you intended\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space and United States on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think as opposed to the actual way their votes are collected accounting\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank\nYou all so much thinking that you that you are well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race as it was\nRunning for United States Senate this against people of color and these are held we will never backed down from fire and if we\n\nEvery weekly for getting on one race in the country then you get in a larger theme playing out in elections around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey I'm here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez he's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he is running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director of national security council\n... you've been there on the ground in the district so talk to us a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide a geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so\nIt's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter than that I mean given to go talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I end this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that goes\nAnd Joe is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country but I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would've allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "20"}
