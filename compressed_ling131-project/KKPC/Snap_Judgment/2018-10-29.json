attacking like preexisting conditions\nI think there are definitely some Republican active\nWill want to finish the job now that John McCain has been replaced and the Senate by a more reliable vote for the Republican agenda but Danielle is right there will also certainly be some wariness given the backlash they've gotten already\nAnd if for Republicans gained some seats in the Senate ah three Republicans wouldn't be able to stop or repeal effort like they did this year That's NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben thank you very much you could we would [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow so every week we focus on one race and we already talked about the Georgia governor's race in the show but here's the thing is just a week and a half left before election day a lot of big races to talk about\nSo this week we're going to add a second race of the week and to do that we've got to ... in our old NPR hate America hey there and we're gonna bring bread jasper's of member station ... in Phoenix a breath hey hey so dumb ethical let's start with you catch us up to speed who's running in this race why does it matter\nWell no matter who wins here the Arizona Senate races going to make history is elected eleven senators since becoming a state Nineteen twelve none of them though has been a woman and that's definitely going to change this November that because voters here will either elect democratic representative cure students cinema\nShe's a former social worker or Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally she's retired from the military with\nThe rank of colonel and she was the first woman to fly in combat\nThis is for the seat that's being vacated by Jeff Flake who decided not to run again because he said he just couldn't see myself getting elected given on the Republican Party has gone one way and and he is gone the other way Brett what is the strategy that that makes Sally and send them are taking into this campaign what if they both been focusing on well\nBoth of them have tried to really make themselves to some degree cinemas project of remaking has lasted many years she was in the state legislature in a very\nProgressive member of that years ago and she's been one of the most moderate members of the house of representatives in Congress whereas mix Sally also started off as a moderate congresswoman but in this campaign she's really embraced President Trump\nSo bright we could really say this for for most Senate races at this point in an election but this has gotten really\nNegative while we were in harm's way in uniforms cinema was protesting us any pink to to\nMartha McSally seems with things you can say whatever she wants as long as she shows a picture of herself in uniform for your show by just to get a link to show why about anything\nAnd it missed all this what are you hearing from the actual voters that you talk to\nPeople talk about the ads um they they are disgusted by them you know one particular voter you know it was really striking she didn't want to give me her name but she said that she drives two hours a day on her commute and she fears these ads on the radio\nOh my God those ads are horrible absolutely horrible\nHonestly it reminds me as petty school ground catty girl just yelling at\nEach other so I just prefer to distance myself from that\nSo you might not vote in that race because of that fact was talking to a political scientist here who said she wasn't sure if that was a strategy by mix Sally but\nYou know the people who might be turned off from voting are people who are a less likely to vote in the first place and the women and so those might both be constituencies that cares and set them up what meat so you know the negative ads are definitely having an effect especially if they're like irrelevant to you know important salient issues\nYou know people like to say that negative ads don't work in that they don't like negative ads but the thing is negative ads do work\nOr the fact of the matter is that cinema was leading in these polls her favorability ratings were much higher\nAnd there's a reason why she is now a started to to lose some ground and it's all because of those ads and by the way if anybody is annoyed with those ads and you're in the car listening to the radio what are you doing not listening to NPR

in the end it didn't matter\nHas been weird really how how one six of the previous seven races coming into the last two way he could win the title but he finished last week and didn't quite legitimate for today but did with it it's it's a very old scenario that he kind of stumbled over the finish line but\nThe record books I'm going to remember that they're going to remember him as a five time world champion\nAnd can we talk about that the magnitude of this way and I mean most people that walks on the moon than one five will titles in for me the one\nI like that that I'm older I'm quite amazing isn't it won ...\nAn amazing Argentinean driver in the Nineteen fifties he won five world championships that record stood the forty seven years until Michael Schumacher came and one seven

great just F. one drivers of all time maybe we have to wait until he retires to truly the way he fits because\nKind of go on to win seven like she America I don't know I wouldn't put it past him he said at the top of his game but he definitely has to statistically at least he's comfortably in the top three now\nWell he's got a load of racing is ahead of him so what's next for Hamilton\nWell he'll come back next year trying to defend his championship he's good at two more years on his contract Mercedes if they can hold off the the the attack of Ferrari and Red Bull next year and for the

many things that imply that you wonder at what point does he move away from racing and decide you know it's time to explore other avenues I don't think it'll be yet that they think it'll be in the next couple of years\nBut it it certainly something you'll be looking at\nThe rise of the far right his being a political reality many countries in recent days with the possible exception of
