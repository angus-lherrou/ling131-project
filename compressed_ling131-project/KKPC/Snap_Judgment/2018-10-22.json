{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "Do you still think that climate change is a hoax I think something's happening some things are changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think\nProbably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give ... trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nDo we have a sense of you know really that the real tangible side effects of this\nSo the idea is by not pursuing climate change your protective coal jobs even if you don't bring them all back\nBut then there's also this idea that if you make energy more expensive\nThen people will have to pay more companies that rely on a lot using a lot of energy will have to Jack up their prices it's like what did you hear about the terrorists that they raise prices on consumer is basically the same thing that you'll raise prices on consumers and therefore consumers will have to pass\nWell yeah it's just an interesting thing though because I mean really what this is is it's it's a debate about I mean for sure if we were to address climate change tomorrow right let's just say that the Trump Administration somehow woke up tomorrow and said hey we actually think climate change Israel we want to do something about it in the short term for sure there would be job loss or be economic loss just because\nYou know that would require a complete\nChange your market the way things work but\nWhen you look at the the implications of not doing anything I mean\nIt's hard to put a number on the future right it's hard to know exactly\nWhat the effects of climate change you're going to be and how much it would cost but I mean the research it has come out of saying it's going to cost trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars parts of the country of parts of the world are going to be unlivable right so there are some really big issues that you're you're just kind of kicking down the road and at some point somebody's gonna have to pay that cost if we're not paying it right now\nSo let's talk a little bit about what a specifically at stake in the midterms right if Republicans keep Congress do we get a sense that anything would change would things be kind of acts but I did that we've seen in terms of the Trump administration's um rejection of climate change into\nI mean yeah a lot of what you've seen right if you think about the Obama administration if you think about the Trump Administration is doing right now in terms of environmental policy almost everything that's happening is in the executive branch right Congress has not they're not really doing anything bad habit for a long time when it comes to the environment\nToday on the flip side than if Democrats\nAre who do seem to see this as a pressing issue right now right politically you are hearing Democrats talk a little bit more about climate change and some of the threats they hear from the Republican opponent so if Democrats were to take control even if one chamber of the house I mean what could they do too I mean beyond say oversight\nThat's about it every Democrat I talked to said oversight oversight oversight which you know we shouldn't be what does that mean exactly are you hearing you know expect to see Ryan Zinke key uh Andrew wheeler the head of the EPA\nRuns it could be in the head of the interior um you know you would expect to see those guys are in hearings over and over and over again whether they'd be having to come up and explain a lot of the robots that they're doing explain why they've\nGot rid of the mess and ruled explain you know the spending cuts for climate science at NASA or those sort of things where it makes it very difficult for them do their jobs because they're basically having to spend all their time preparing for hearings and took a potentially slow down the process you're saying\nYeah could slow down the process you know there was another interesting thing that uh you know Tom piled who is with the American energy alliance very supportive of Trump's agenda you said it would actually also give Democrats an environmental groups a stage to craft a narrative that\nThat hasn't really gotten out there right now against what Trump is doing with the environment um which I thought was really interesting you said there's just so much other news happening that environment issues really haven't you know taken center stage um and it would give them an opportunity to actually really to craft that narrative and put it out there\nThat's basically what the Republicans did on climate change under President Obama and they took over the house they would be bringing in a you know the EPA administrators and others and basically kind of yell at them and say you're going to put a tax on all these weird heard all these people they were they use that to frame their narrative and make any climate change\nAction seem like it is a tax and it's going to hurt people [noise]\nAll right well thank you to you both NPR's Ayesha Rascoe any brown thank you\nAnd this is the

historic nothing like anything in the world I don't think where all of the crimes\nProperly investigated um and people were brought before the commission\nAnd held accountable for their actions\nAnd I think that in itself was a tremendous thing for the victims and for the strategy for the history such a dice apologies for me and I think so many other victims\nIs one of 'em are are that are actually said to another victim I Lived long enough to see it I'm so glad that I live long enough to see it and there's obviously many others\nThere's sadly didn't live long enough and they probably took their

as its because I've done that I can now walking in the committee on sale a sense of shame now\nI can I don't mind letting people know that I was a victim of abuse worst previously I kept a secret even
