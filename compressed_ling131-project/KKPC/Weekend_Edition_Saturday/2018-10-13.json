Florida President Trump invited hurricane ... to the oval office in dealt with the vicissitudes of the stock market and bears Ron Elving joins us from Washington DC Ron thanks for being with us\nGood morning Scott I'm a major disaster like hurricane Michael often focuses politicians which which didn't Florida but President Trump chose that moment to receive Kanye West of the White House not this wasn't a private meeting like Nixon an Elvis but a a big advance with cameras and questions why\nYou know in the post Katrina era Scott the assumption has been that when a hurricane comes you focus on that instead of the things aside so it was jarring when the president went ahead with his summit with Kanye West and as you say it was a major full media presence in the oval office\nBut the president's theme all week has been to keep the focus on the president\nHe's had a flurry of news availability is way more than usual in fact in the last month these had more than in all the time previously in his presidency very flashy events campaign rallies around the country night after night and that happens just as the cable operations television news\nHas a well they've begun to lose interest in some of those rallies they're not covering them from beginning to end anymore sometimes not covering the mall at all perhaps because they do seem to be Newsweek campaign events and maybe because they've become so frequent\nDoes this week shutting 'em stocks fell off raised questions about what it seemed to be so much good news about the economy including at historically low unemployment rate\nYes it is historically low there there was a steep and sudden sell off though in the middle of the week eight hundred points I Lived out one day and other five hundred the next\nThe Dow did recover and the other indices recovered on friday but there was a chill that went through investors\nThinking about all the times in the past when everything seemed to be going just right until everything seemed to go completely wrong so yes we have been in the middle of rosy scenario or goldie locks economy whichever you prefer\nAh the striking thing from a political standpoint was the president's reaction he does have his own way of dealing with crises even temporary ones and he generally denies that there's a problem and then uses the appearance of a problem as a cudgel against someone else and in this case\nThat was Federal Reserve board chairman Jerome Powell who is of course the president's own appointee [noise]\nI I feel we have to get to the disappearance and the alleged murder of ... the journalists there's been bipartisan outrage and calls for for action on Capitol Hill what can Congress actually do Congress can cut off a lot\nOf our relationship with Saudi Arabia we have enormous arms deals with Saudi Arabia we have an enormous amount of trade with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia spend about twenty seven million dollars in the last year just on lobbying just in Washington DC so this is an intense relationship\nAnd all the money has to go through Congress and even if Jared Kushner is handling the main negotiations and really being our main contact point with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nIt's still Congress that has to write the checks so Congress has real power here and this is a bipartisan issue it's not just Democrats like Chris Coons it's also Republicans like Marco Rubio who are incensed over what appears to have happened to a Washington Post columnist in the embassy of Saudi Arabia in hunker a turkey\nAnd and the question has to be raised with his support outspoken support for Vladimir prudent for Kim Jong on a for president ... ... and I forget the president of the Philippines not working well today\nDoes the president send the message that dictators can do as they please the\nPresident's let's be Frank came to power promising to disrupt official Washington and the way things have been done including in terms of our relationships with just about every other country\nAnd that is a promise on which the president has delivered and his base voters are delighted with it even if it gives you pause to members of Congress and people in the media and other observers Ron Elving thanks so much\nI think he's got\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about than what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was a thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on single\nAnd it hurts your face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh\nWho has their own story to tell you know I Do not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who would have been\nHarmed it certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse thing bishops been people whose names are plastered up on church building\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up\nJust to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care [noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person I Am\nAnd that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area in starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of of of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I\nStill have a face and I just see much less of the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n... now of Washington DC thanks for speaking with us in such a personal way yeah thank you for having\nReporters got a rare glimpse inside a temporary shelter for migrant children in far west Texas on friday\nThe facility opened in June as a series

Kavanaugh had his first week on the Supreme Court their results are good economic news or the number one but dating a nearly fifty year low and Christian evangelist pastor Andrew Brunson has just been released from detention and turkey\nThe president talked about all of this and supportive Republican candidates in Ohio last night NPR's Don ... joined us from Lebanon not far from Cincinnati Don thanks for being with us\nAnd do good morning you spent the day speaking with Trump supporters but first let's hear from the president to speak to her about her just as Kevin ... and how he was treated\nThe way they treated him I've never seen anybody treated like that [noise]\nBut he's a great service because we are more energized those Republicans\nThan ever I think every [noise]\nSo how does that feel on the ground on their polls that uh that show that Republican enthusiasm is on the upswing\nRight now I'm In one of the redder parts of Ohio and here you can absolutely feel that GOP voters are animated and Kevin all the confirmation fight is the reason\nI was walking around downtown Lebanon and I met forty one year old Consuelo green she told me she voted Trump but has always been an independent voter she says she also voted for Bill Clinton for president way back when but here's her take on twenty eight\nI might even be leaning to actually joined the Republican Party completely not okay so based on what you're seeing or their particular issues or things that have happened that way and parties but hey I just don't agree with how the Democrats are handling things and the outlandish\nAnd not willing to sit down and listening to the other side\nAnd it's got when I pressed her she said the attacks on Kevin ... pushed her over the edge\n[noise] still a as a Republican operative certainly no they're they're kind of bucking a historic trends at the party in power usually loses seats in the mid term shows the president addressed that\nWell it's clearly the reason he is working it so hard he's got another event tonight in Kentucky a his practice of course is to dismiss polls that don't contain good news so he still does that\nI can tell you that at the at the rallies people often don't know who's our congressional representative is a and even if they do they'll often readily admit that they are just there to see Trump but and\nThat was the first one I've got to deal with all this out you've got to get off and there's a lot\nI'm a Republican ticket anyway [noise]\nNot really gonna change by the way I think\nSo it's got bats are from last night in Lebanon it's thirty four year old Chris Miller he works as a production manager says he's a conservative uh I you know I pressed him on congressional races and he just kept saying he's there to see Trump he doesn't mind to pitch from Trump but he's not paying much attention to it\nAfter hurricane Michael accessibility was a problem storm surge washed out entire sections of the main coastal road highway Ninety eight\nIt also temporarily forced the closure of a bridge that links Appalachian coal live with its neighbor East Point now the bridges reopened\nIn this another coastal communities mandatory evacuations were ordered the mini decided to stay ethnic warfare lives just across highway Ninety eight from the bay so he stayed with friends a few blocks inland came to check on his place was surrounded\nBy water had to wait in to the front door and and seeing those still water\nIn there and there was um my cats was in there swimming around I I didn't think that it's going to come up this habit you know if it happens again oh surely gonna matter there\nWhen he began cleaning up Walker said there were crabs in his house a friend found the snake\n... millimeter was cleaning up her yard yesterday burning positive limbs twigs leaves left by the storm she works as a nine one one police dispatcher as the storm raged when the floodwaters began rising she says she took a number of calls from people asking for help\nWe just told him you know you took your life in your own hands sales Maine and cruel but when we mandatory evacuation we do it for a reason and we're not going to put our guy's lives on the line cause you decided to stay and put your own life and I\nFortunately middle under says there weren't any casualties from the storm in East Point for Appalachian coal although the people are OK many businesses aren't [noise]\nEvidence quality oysters foreigner Lynn morphine and yesterday was sweeping of mud wind to clean up after a hurricane again\nWhere the water came up about three foot inside the building it busted alone this on the water came in that way\nFourteen his business a retail seafood shopping restaurant took a lot of damage Thirteen Years ago in hurricane Dennis before that her father owned a wholesale seafood business to hurricanes in Nineteen eighty five wiped him out even before the storm the seafood business fear was in bad shape\nFor several years now poor water quality and apple electrical a base has led the declining oyster harvest for Martina and others here recovery from hurricane Michael one more skilled decline\nAnd we'll we'll movie that you know I don't take us a little time or made up pretty bad right now but we survivors we've done it before and just the price we thankful living where we live\nTo begin the recovery Martina says the first thing she and others need to get the power turned back on Greg Allen NPR News app electrical of Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also the Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman with member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called\nMatch which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens then the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but\nI Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYou know and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what it is a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWill the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following the state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAt a grocery winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the richest man\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating the bases really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so it's all about who's going to actually show up Johnny Kauffman of member station
