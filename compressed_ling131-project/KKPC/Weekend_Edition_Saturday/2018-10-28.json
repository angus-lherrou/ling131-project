McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning ...\nAh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know is that a\nLot of people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers\nThe names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by of course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nIt is

'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us Sarah ... there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how\nHow does this fit into this awful tax\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil like an eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course

will need\nTo know the Pittsburgh supports them as a lifting them up thank you\n\n[noise] Hi I'm Jeff Finkelstein I'm the president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh\nUm so I have to begin by saying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium\nUm this is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who have been affected and it's real when once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families how we're in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to help our Jewish community and the Pittsburgh region or heal from this\nI Want to echo a lot of the banks in gratitude that people have already expressed to local law enforcement\nYou know when it hits it hits home if it's a extra hard to deal with\nYou spent time also yesterday at a Greek center what did you tell people how do you counsel people about something like this\nYeah well I think just being there for them and letting them know that there are people there for them you hogs and and and letting people cry on your shoulder and and just letting them know again you're going to be there for\nMhm and um I did have to [noise] to tell one I'm a woman that her brothers [noise] the water for brothers who I knew at the time has been killed from what I've heard\nAnd I have to tell her that I mean that's part of that must have been so hard it is very hard\nBut it's part of I think being a rabbi [noise] um but she deserve to know what I knew at that time um as far as rather brother I didn't know at the time we did just didn't know what the story was\nSo there was an uncertainty there um there were a lot of people that are helping who came to try to you know Pittsburgh is that you've heard it's a wonderful community suddenly wonderful Jewish community it's just a wonderful\nCommunity we have a wonderful a medical facilities that belief that through an excellent job our politicians are good they're good leaders\nAnd the leaders of the Jewish community are strong and it also the Jewish community gets along together one with another even though we believe and maybe different kinds of things so it's very special spin a special place to grow up in a special place to raise my kids I have to say I'm very grateful to have that opportunity\nSo that was our immediate job is to comfort the mourners and to comfort the community and to just be strong as we take each day as it comes\nFrom I chucked diamond thank you very much for speaking with us in our deepest condolences on such a very sad\nDay appreciate that I Hope it's her joyous occasion to be together indeed okay thank you thank you Bye bye Bye bye\nTo help us make sense of something so senseless um we are now joined by NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson um and to put this into context as well because there were package bombs sent a prominent Democrat this past week and uh this is affecting our political discourse in our political leaders good morning Mara\nHigh they're little and President Trump held a political rally in Illinois in the wake of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue what did he have to say\nYeah let me just say a few thoughts first of all my mom grew up in the Jewish community yeah Pittsburgh she's Ninety to my cousins all grew up in squirrel hill\nAnd what we're talking about I think is the worst anti Semitic attack in us history just days after as you just said the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in us history so too horrific violent\nActs and the president has had a lot of unifying words he has spoken out\nAgainst what he's called pure evil but he has followed those words with partisan attacks politics as usual at his rallies with a little less ... he said last night at his rally in Illinois I'm going to turn it down a little bit and he did\nBut it's also true and we're going to have a big debate about this that he has tweeted that George Soros funded the caravan the church leader Jim ... Berg also posted on social media the Jews were funding the caravan he particularly\nI was angry about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nAnd\nThe Kevin McCarthy the majority leader\nIn the house has been tweeting how Soros Steyer and Bloomberg are trying to steal this election which is pretty coated anti Semitic language so we're going to have a big debate about whether the president's words words of other\nPeople helped create this climate nobody's saying that in any way the president is responsible for what happened\nBut there is what he says and then there is what people here we're also going to have a big debate about gun control right after the incident the president said that if there had been more people with guns and the synagogue this wouldn't have happened already you've heard the Pittsburgh mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania say no that's not the answer\nSo ten days nine days out from the election we've got the situation\nTo process and try to figure out how to stop in the future\nMine let me just say first of all I'm so sorry I didn't realize that you had a personal connection to the synagogue this is not the synagogue just at the community to the community I mean you mentioned um that there are of course many ramifications a mid term elections are just over a week away\nWill the offensive this past week affect the elections and if so how\nWell I don't know I think the easy answer the quick answers to say that the trajectory of this election is pretty well set\nA the house looks like it's trending to the Democrats the Senate looks like it's trending to the Republicans but it might have some effect I mean this once again thrust gun violence into the political debate\nSome people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings may be that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that\nIt makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the Senate God's shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that he'd been living than momentum and now this bomb\nThing happened and that's all the media is talking about if you've been listening to special coverage from NPR News [noise]\nColorado Public radio news helps deep in your

looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet or any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how she became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty six team you had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a in a political anger starts coming out in in social media wants thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale\nLevy new at the time he was taking a risk on

always see that direct experience of mind reflected in books and that's definitely something I Want to see open up in the world\nBut the industry as a whole still has a long way to go\nThe story is that things really haven't changed in the last Twenty years\nLibrarian Kathleen Horning is the director of the cooperative children's book center at the University of Wisconsin she says fewer than ten percent of books feature characters of color or are written by non white authors and there's not a lot of variety in those books she says they're often historical narrative about slavery or civil rights\nWhat we do see a lot of with diversity are books like Harry Potter uh that are just pure fantasy and in fact those are the kind of books that African American children for example really are clamoring for\nBut Horning is hopeful and just over the last couple of years there have been some breakout titles like last year's dread nation by just you know Ireland the Cato which theories by

here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson this morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the presidents in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has\nMade a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut just before\nA rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it and I'd have a much different John frankly the press was even handed the press was fair I'd have a much different don't all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief no he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation\nBut he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energizes his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race in fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president's feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nWhile television is still wear a campaign spent much of their money digital is coming on strong the research firm Burrell associates estimates one point eight
