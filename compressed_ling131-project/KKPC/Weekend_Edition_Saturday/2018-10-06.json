technology will have developed so much that it will be going in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so a bit of oats Baltimore is in there about the role it technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy tiny as\nWell I think production is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas so I think if it's going to happen by itself that\nPeople even though the projections are that it will keep going home to at least twenty five ... will be some some increase that's not the protections I Would say if you look at the expected production of oil and gas Norway has filtered should three that they keep going up and then it type of something like that one I think that ... has\nProbably reached the peace now and then ... yeah ... yeah the one expect that that would be more gas resources to be found so\nDoes that mean that question here would be should we ask nomination politicians allow for the also the petroleum the gas industry to develop new fields for the future and that's something I Would argue against but that that would be a political question\nAnd and that political question how hard is it then for you if that's what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of their economic security within a decade that's not very long\nNo it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now an off that that the oil price sale of so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think the ... site it became more\nTo how vulnerable we are today oil industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think and then we just turned\n... do you believe that I guess in the industry will be there for quite some time\nBut it wouldn't have seen that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry as well and we should try to find new ways of living that would also help the world that find solutions to the climate the to the climate\nProblem there is a ... a crisis could be the opposite\nYeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in Norway sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera that they haven't really realize the effects of climate change so\nMore often you know you had the abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually plan for it\nBut we can't really hope for a climate crisis for Norway to to react\nGay uh passed on to the climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which Norway considers its dependency on on oil and gas is how\nHow we we we we have to remember the last Eighteen years we we reached peak oil in two thousand or so we have ... production of oil from the last eight years so we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing\nAnd with the predictions icy I come see the the one that just shutting off the lights on the region shellfish born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ... but then what does that make me ... look for new ways rolled in that particular debate but\nI just started up where you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry scares right you've you've ... well we all lost\nEscape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle\nClimate change and we're looking at three to four degrees yes it is and and I would strongly insist on that we need to shift the economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here and that's\nWhy I've come back to this is a political question because to me is the trolling resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is none of the hopeful ah for the oil industry in terms of economics at the guy at I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables will have a bigger role\nCan she wants to come and yeah I mean of course there will be more renewables but also the road we'll requests more energy so that we have to look ... question has well so\nUh I'm a I'm On line with the good here yeah I think the uh ...\nBut with natural gas in the mix\nOr in the near future and end the long term as well and it will be necessary to meet the green shift notion\nAnd those are the agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas tank you to Kent goodness then carry this this cast ski

that\nWe have then made the parts of the litter form incomplete and what that basically does that kind of plays a slug trick on the mind which is of course the mind\nInstantly tries to resolve shapes result circles and diagnosed in ... so that actually slows down the prices of reading inside your brain and then um I can actually trigger memory\nSo if the type faces both incomplete and uncommon that helps us remember\nYes that's and it's ... ... the uncommon aspect is very important because this is talk I came out of a lot of tasting and they in psychology labs\nAnd we really we tested as a
