I Can't even name or people who work at the royal court are putting names on the list people like me and others and these people are no blacklisted in this country\nAnd we know it I mean we all know it okay so this is this is what's at stake\nWhy do you think this is happening now\nWhat's what's different now is is certain regimes even if there were fears\nAnd bowls and sometimes is a process with their own a bonus did not do this level of things the road or in the day like OK\nMubarak could make\nOpponents disappearing Egypt he was never there to touch someone in the streets of London or girl in\nThe summer the leadership used to kidnap some ... some of the reasons in Switzerland or elsewhere but they would not kill someone in the streets of Paris or or Rome okay so this is no different these countries today\nFeel that they have wizard and extra ordinarily enormous story which is our resolution that started in plenty doesn't okay so\nThey are today on the full blast quest and hunt against anybody could threaten their political existence\nIf the west specifically and the United states I'm don't react forcefully to Jamal ... disappearance what do you think the effect will be\nWill get snow more anymore at all about ... it's the balls\nA first of all a whole range of principles\nWhich you are squandering and completely putting aside\nIt's also about the whole sociology\nOf people who are not even the researchers and journalists people citizens who are looking for a breathing space in their countries okay these people don't even want to foreign politics as much as they just want to exist Jay they just want to go to their work\nAnd have an opinion if the west doesn't take action on this all this will be in danger and the west wing to be complicit actively complicit to creating and to transforming this region into a huge open air prison this is it\nThat was just that the who at the Carnegie Endowment for international peace thank you very much thank you [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor of from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chance to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally\nHe only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\n[noise] so what is your advice to other kids of donors\nI

W.

Tom\nI think you should see the potential allies Rob and denouncing them\nOr as enemies well how does that work how for example kind of politician run on progressive values um where the language doesn't alienate what the survey says the vast majority of the country I mean how does it practically will\nBut I think that's a huge difference between\nStanding up for minorities that are under attack and talking about is no way which sounds like you have a sort of laundry list of all of a different groups that you have to win over in order to win election and I think that what's the difference between how block Obama talked about it and how he talked about it actually\nI was struck for example by the way that Cory Booker argues for a set of progressive causes when he talks about why does the we have to have more equity in high school education she always she talks about the fact that it's unjust\nTo the children and poor school district um who don't get a good education but he also talks about the fact that we need to educate all of our citizens to the best abilities because we're in a global race of competitiveness with China\nWhen he talks about a prison reform doesn't just talk about the injustice to the people who are imprisoned you also talks about the huge costs to the tax payer I think those are ways in which you're making the argument that it's close to your heart but you're also trying to show why does the business in everybody's interest\nI can hear liberals listening to this conversation and say you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is the other side weaponize his words in a way that that that we cannot cede the ground and conservatives listening to this conversation might think\nThey're always trying to label us as racists at and and the divide has become so vast in this country that people are listening to a conversation about something like this in totally different ways now\nIt is a problem but some people on the oil dried for example use popular discontent with political correctness in order to get a license to spew things for the straight forty racist\nUm but I think the right to sponsor that used to have a little bit of a sense of humor and say look we can sometimes be true invested in whether the appropriate thing to say is the Latino or Latin acts\nBut you know what that is not a reason to deny but we have deep injustice and our country come join us in the political side or to make this a a country that lives up to its principles better stuff at the moment\nThat special monk you can read his piece at the Atlantic website he's a lecture on government at Harvard and the author of the people versus democracy why our freedom is in danger and how to save it take you so much\nThank you [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nColorado Public Radio's a window into what is happening in the world the nation and right here at home\nIf you count on CPR is a place for trustworthy journalism an enlightening conversation don't forget CPR count your financial support give a little ... on line of CPR ... it all makes their membership drives or an opportune time to remind you of that\nAnd I and my first time donating from any Pfeifer live very exciting has gotten learning a lot and I were making\nVery enjoyable my name is Rachel, Rachel and I live in Colorado Springs CPR or an E L I donate at least a dollar a day or night drive more all the delivered Nate\nHi this is Daniel from Denver CPR is of vital resource for our community because it helps us me better informed and helps us to better understand current issue that's why I get to CPR you should get to see if you are too\nWhen you give a gift right now you'll be automatically answer to win a trip to London [noise]\nThe strip includes round trip air and seven nicer the luxury wandering hotel [noise]\nYou don't have to give a good answer for why not try it out and make a difference [noise] you'll be answered automatically and there's a woman trip sweepstakes and\nYou'll be supporting all that you tuning into with or without a job you complete rules and trip details at CPR dot org\nWell today feels a lot different than yesterday doesn't it good morning object Delaware CPR news it's cold highs only in the twenties for Denver today and highs only in the teens for the foot hills so bundle up out there\nThe metro area hasn't gotten a lot of snow so far but up to three inches and still possible by the end of the day but when the storm clears out tonight sunny skies in slightly warmer\nTemperatures return tomorrow highs you're forty for Denver Monday\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more just an equitable world learn more at age eight W.

before the November elections will be taking a look at what is often called identity politics and there's one device that phrase that has been at the forefront of the way identity politics is expressed in public and the political correctness that we have embraced enough\nAlready we have to stop with political correctness Americans have been choking on political correctness\nFreshman I guess you can't use freshmen any say first year you can't say right actually measure discriminated against when\nHe seemed culture liberals supposedly love it conservative can't stand it or at least that's what we've been told but a new study by the group more in common shows something quite different political scientist Josh among wrote about this survey for the Atlantic and I asked him to explain the results of\nThe first headline is just how many Americans think the political correctness has become a problem in our country is actually four out of five eighty percent of Americans\nFeel worried about what kind of role but it plays in our disclose among the second big surprises but that's just sort of narrative\nThat young people are women perhaps people of color tend to really like political correctness and older white men are the ones who deeply opposed it and what's really striking is that that's not at all what you've seen the data right the best proxies or education level and then come\nUp sort of a white people are actually slightly less likely to fame for political correctness is a problem than people of color but people are most likely to see it as a problem or a Hispanic or Native American\nIn the same way in terms of age very youngest um don't like it any better than older people on the other hand if you earn more than a hundred thousand dollars a year if you have a post graduate degree venue much more likely to like political correct [noise]\nThe reason it's so interesting is because we often portray the country is divided right hopelessly your analysis says that there is quote and exhausted majority whose views are not actually so different from one another [noise] can you explain what that group is feeling right now\nYeah so it's easy to think of it as sort of fifty percent of the population\nWill walk in every single way I'm On a two two percent of the country who are just sort of racist and you don't have we have lots of hate speech and what we see in the study is that eighty percent of Americans dislike political correctness in eighty two percent or were you worried\nAbout a hate speech so most people are not racist but they also a little concerned that if they say the wrong thing a base stress themselves a little bit wrongly they might somehow a come off as being hostile when but not so you know one of the people\nWho was talking in a focus group that looks you know nowadays I I'm not quite sure do I say you do I say Jewish do I say black to do I say African American and I feel like if I got the wrong people are going to shout at me and and that's where it is educational divide comes in\nBecause the kinds of people frankly who you know listen to NPR every weekend to perhaps have a higher degree and so on they tend to be more comfortable knowing what ... found invest a lot of Americans who have good intentions who don't have faith in the hospital but they're just unsure about what was to choose\n[noise] yeah I Want to take the term Latin acts um which is gaining popularity I'm Latina and and if I talk to members of my parents' generation they feel entirely excluded from that term the term is meant to be more inclusive write 'em but these terms can also make people feel like they're not in on the conversation\nYeah and that's what we just have to be self critical about what's actually going to achieve more\nRacial equality in our country if you think that for your own political reasons ... is a better term to use then and Godspeed to you but I think if you talk to your fellow citizens\nAnd they care for example about the ways in which Hispanics are being discriminated against at the moment the United states but they don't use your preferred Tom I think you should see the potential allies rather than denouncing them\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the element\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground in is not a silver bullet\nHit the expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about\nOne in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute said that they more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce in a line that I knew that it can actually be much more cost me and take our line right now and she's ... and an overhead wire\nMcNamara says in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be ... of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population it keep the lights on even if the broader than\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change\nThat's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries Jeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's elections closed in Florida we know Florida as a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season market pseudo covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line\nThanks for being with us driving so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago he's seen a lot of storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and on the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all of\nThe associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just stripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees\nJust a really powerful storm surge that was kind of an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron dissent is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRich got was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes so he's been out of all over both physically and these\nDifferent pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee mayor\nIt was hit pretty hard\nYeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum buys punt run the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn one case actually chainsaw in trees away\n[laughter] and I'm moving to free really show he's changed your trees [laughter] well he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen or what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again I understand that like the entire panhandle meal is impossible pull right now because you can't get a hold of half you know eating in a sense of the people\nThat political as my computer joining us
