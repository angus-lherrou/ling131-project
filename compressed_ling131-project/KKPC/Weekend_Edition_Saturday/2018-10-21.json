understand this is the most popular course at Rollins which isn't surprising how did you decide to teach a class about zombies though is this a bait and switch to get students to read Aristotle\n[laughter] no it's not a bait and switch we actually talk about Romney's I came upon the idea because I was trying to figure out what is the nature of consciousness\n... give us a an example of the kinds of things that you are grappling with\nSo most people and students\nIncluded take consciousness to simply be awareness\nBut scientists are now thinking of consciousness as the result of the neurological energy in our brain so in the class we go inside of the brain and we talk about the along the brain and the owner of the brain to give students the tools\nTo talk about things like consciousness and freedom and responsibility\n[noise] ... it's the idea that these are basically these kind of mindless flesh eating monsters and we're not clear how much um they're aware of the things that they're doing\nThat to exactly right yes I was a good student [laughter]\nWe often ignore the unable to brain or what's sometimes called the reptilian brain so zombies exist in the

the car and you sort of ... out and you don't even remember the way that you got to\nWhere you're going that's the perfect example and the real world applications\nFor the speculation right because there are murder cases where the perpetrator says that they zoned out and there's a big debate about how conscious they were of what they were doing\n[noise] there is a famous case called the ...

of a word that can follow my first one and proceed my second one in each case to complete a familiar two word phrase\nAnd you acknowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction I I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nI uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things you know that I wrote on a posted as I was like saying what do we want right now in this moment I wrote you know unlock all and ...\nAnd ... stands for non nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance on our show where some trans women wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massaging anywhere I didn't immediately said to van and trace\nLet stand up and tell your story instead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said about about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I've thought about what\nThe world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning what I needed to recognize but it took me a met it was that her I Would say some of both trace and bad for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways sacrifice themselves\nAnd in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine and that one\n[noise] what's your relationship with them temperate now we haven't spoken in a little while [noise]\nThis is going to keep happening right friends artists people we admire then to come under scrutiny and it will be painful for their friends and colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this is a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone especially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again it's it's a very sacrificial act\nUm and in terms of the men and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men deeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege\nAnd thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and love\nDoes that mean the same for ... for you\nOf course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor as career over the protection of trace lives that's career and Ben Barnes career I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarchal so we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight white says men who have had positions of power and their expectation to continue and that power for the rest of their lives is part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place their pain first before everybody else's\nShe'll sell the way thank you so much for your honesty the memoir is called she wants it think

it's about opportunity than there are organizations Christie cook says she owns one of only two certified Mason contractors in Colorado owned by women\nConstruction is composed of a lot of different

lot of the population that we hadn't done a lot of outreach to were really excited to reach out to our young women\nJessica Varney is Eighteen years old and already a pipe fitting apprentice

we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after a Hispanic nickname his rival that overlooks has long used\nFor\nSelf hasn't escapes scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWhat's your name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an NGO sized version of it he was the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over you know during the day that we can\nIdentities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nAnd so I think that was really why I started getting into music was because there was something I felt super passionate about and I really like doing it\nFelt like I was good at it and that obviously empowered me to keep

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\n... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy prayers are how are the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tests to the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of the issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents [noise]\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nMay try to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others and so there clearly not a beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man driven and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the studies which have yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange that eating less meant that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf

understand this is the most popular course it Rawlins which isn't surprising how did you decide to teach a class about zombies though is this a bait and switch to get students to read Aristotle\n[laughter] no it's not a bait and switch we actually talk about zombies I came upon the idea because I was trying to figure out what is the nature of consciousness\n... give us a an example of the kinds of things that you are grappling with\nSo most people and students included to consciousness to simply be awareness but scientists\nAre now thinking them consciousness as the result of the neurological energy in our brains so in the class we go inside of the brain and we talk about the along the brain and the ... of the brain\nTo give students the tools to talk about things like consciousness and freedom and responsibility\nIt is the idea that these are basically these kind of mindless flesh eating monsters and we're not clear how much um they're aware of the things that they're doing\nThat's exactly right yes I was a good student [laughter]\nWe often ignore the unable to brain or what's sometimes called the reptilian brain so zombies exist in the reptilian brain in the movies and as it turns out in the real world humans have\nWhat we sometimes referred to as our zombie brain and you might think about it as auto pilot\nLike when you're driving the car and you sort of zone out and you don't even remember the way that you got to where you're going\nThat's the perfect example\nAnd the real world applications for the speculation right because there are murder cases where the perpetrator says that they zoned out and there's a big debate about how conscious they were of what they were doing\n[noise] there is a famous case called the ... parks case in which he owns out and kill his father in law and almost killed his mother in law after looking into his history when you sign that he had a history of sleepwalking\nThe cases refer to as homicidal some number ... meaning homicide while sleepwalking\nThe Miami Herald profiled you this past week which is where we heard about your class and you had some advice for those of us fearing the coming zombie apocalypse and I count myself among them [laughter] so how should we survive\nOkay so if as I'll be apocalypse hits you'll need food and water shelter\nAnd of course ammunition to fight off is on the attack and the the place that I can think of that would have plenty of it and a lot of things for you to move around as Walmart so often tell people go to Wal Mart hunker down and fight it out for as

agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been ... to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance at our show where some trans women wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massage name where I didn't immediately said to van and trace let's stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said thought about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I thought about what the world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a met it was the her I Would say some of both trace and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways sacrifice themselves and in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine and that one\n[noise] what's your relationship with them temperate now we haven't spoken in a little while [noise]\nThis is going to keep happening my friend's artists people we admire then to come under scrutiny and it will be painful for their friends and colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this is a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone\nEspecially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again it's it's a very sacrificial act\nUm and in terms of the men and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men deeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege\nAnd thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and love\nDoes that mean the same for every ten more for you\nOf course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor as career over the protection of trace was that's career and Ben Barnes career and I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarchal so we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight white says men who have had positions of power and their expectation to continue and that power for the rest of their lives is part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place their pain first before everybody else's\nShe'll sell the way thank you so much for your honesty the memoir is called she wants it\nThank you
