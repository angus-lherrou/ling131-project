Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not criticized the Saudis and beer down ... was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr ... had died a in their custody he at the at the embassy and pushed and both\nThe president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fact that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called ... unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like bowling and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment whereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to facts are as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of\nThat did the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting again given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like uh not sell with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the ace his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested Kammen Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nThese three fellows who who beat Matthew Shepard to death they felt um okay about that they felt justified about that and for Matthew\nTo come home to the Episcopal Church which he was a part and for the LDP T community far and wide to to see a church welcoming him to rest there in the cathedral forever is a huge statement and I'm proud to be associated with it\nYou know who he will be resting near well\nI Do know that in the crypt in addition to Woodrow Wilson is Helen Keller and her teacher and sold them and uh I think that is the perfect place for Matthew a grade\nTeacher and or someone like kill him killer who told us all up\nAnd thanks to match parents' we've all been moved to action uh and I think in some ways our heterosexual allies were radicalized\nBy staff and so there are very many more people fighting to end violence against us Bishop Gene Robinson thanks so much for being with us thank you Scott\n\nAnd you're listening to weekend edition from NPR News\nThis was Colorado Public radio news I'm Vicki Delaware governor Hickenlooper who said he won't decide on whether to run for president neutral after he leaves office early next year\nBut he's already taking some steps to build his profile on the national stage this weekend he's in the early caucus state of Iowa we started CPR is back to Brooklyn to see what he's up to you from Des Moines to she tells editor Megan Verlee it'll be a busy trip\nHe's got a lot on his plate he's speaking at the world food prize it's a big international conference on food security and he's talking about public private partnerships\nAnd then he'll be doing some political events he's meeting with Democratic Party officials local community activists state lawmakers he'll be campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Iowa fed Hubble it's a very close to ...\nKnow remind me why would our governor be an Iowa right now\nIt's the first presidential primary stayed and he's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential didn't twenty twenty\nAnd when I talk to him he says he's really here in Iowa to see if the message he would like to deliver would resonate here about collaboration and working together and some of the accomplishments he feels he's been able to achieve in Colorado so\nHe's me mustn't keep people we talked to someone at Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters of their political reporter who's very familiar with all the people coming in and out of the state and he said that's exactly what someone should be doing it this time of year if they're interested in a presidential bid and indeed a lot of other democratic contenders are in town right now\nDo you get a sense is democratic voters in Iowa have any sense who ah governor Hickenlooper is at this point\nThe ones I've talked to don't um he doesn't have a lot of national name id and even ... will admit that's the case Bernie Sanders is here this weekend\nCalifornia senator Kamala Harris is hosting an event Monday\nNew Jersey senator Cory Booker was here recently so there's a lot of competition then you have Joe Biden and you have all of this war and so he he hasn't really puncture through all those names but Hickenlooper said that's not the goal this trip he's really trying to get a feel of the state of Iowa where they are right now\nYou went to one of the governors of events in Colorado He has a a fairly low key persona um tries to kind of come across as very\nNon partisan did you get any sense that he um might be talking a little bit differently outside the state\nI really didn't that was the message she was giving here he was talking about the oil and gas industry and working with environmental groups when it came to reducing methane emissions talking about his work with Governor key thick on health care policy and trying to bridge that partisan divide\nAnd listening to people collaborating he said we collaborate at the speed of trust you know so it's this idea that you really do have to reach across the aisle and\nLook to people with different backgrounds in yourself and try to find that common ground and that's a message she's tried to highlight as governor\nAnd I think that will be a big part of his pitch to Iowa and a political reporter I talked to said that could play well in Iowa he's not from a coast she's from the middle of the country and not too far away from the state and they might like that approach\nOkay so he may be able to Iowa voters as sort of the middle of the road candidate but what challenges do you think he'll face putting himself out on the national stage\nNow someone's going to have to appeal to progressive voters really energized Democrats while also attract more moderate folks\nWhen Bernie Sanders ran had a very clear message and things like universal health care and you'll really people were rallying around him and Hillary had her supporters so\nHe'll what can Hickenlooper find to really get people excited about him as a candidate you know even he will say he's not going to have the traditional democratic constituencies so can he find a different path\nWell Brenda thank you happy to talk to you\nThat CPR betcha Brooklyn speaking with editor Megan Verlee about governor Hickenlooper his trip to Iowa this week where he's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential ... you're listening to Colorado Public

what do you think of the Saudi explanation\nIt's a very lame a it's an outrage what they've done a they their actions have been deeply offensive I think to a Americans of regardless of political opinion here at home and I do think that it's a very complicated issue for us\nUm we've got thirty seconds left complicated in in that the Saudis have so much money invested here\nNow and complicated in that we have a major regional adversary in that part of the world is Iran\nAnd the Saudis are aligned with us against the Iranian or a exploits in the middle east and so this is what makes it very

that Saudi Arabia's offered an explanation for his death\nIt's only a first step president wants to gather more information before deciding how to respond to some members of Congress have called for sanctions on the Saudis so far the administration's appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\nBumpy auto reporters on his return to the U. S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nLong strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n... is right about that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly endless stand resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTruck has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or inhibit it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about the show ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military and those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states\nThe kingdom was pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... and loose should motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard and Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel process and author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both the U.S and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nHas

Scott\n\nAnd you're listening to weekend edition from NPR News\nThis is Colorado Public radio news I'm Vicki ... governor Hickenlooper who said he won't decide on whether to run for president until after he leaves office early next year\nBut he's already taking some steps to build his profile on the national stage this weekend he's in the early caucus state of Iowa we said CPR is better to Berkeley to see what he's up to you from Des Moines is she tells editor Megan Verlee it'll be a busy trip\nHe's got a lot on his plate he's speaking at the world food prize it's a big international conference on security and he's talking about public private partnerships\nAnd then he'll be doing some political events he's meeting with Democratic Party officials local community activists state lawmakers he'll be campaigning for the Democratic diminish ... candidate here in Iowa fed Hubble it's a very close and tore all race\nNow reminded me why would our governor being Iowa right now\nIt's the first presidential primary state and he's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential dead and twenty twenty and when I told him he said he's really here in Iowa to see if\nThe message he would like to deliver would resonate here about collaboration and working together and some of the accomplishments he feels he's been able to achieve in Colorado so\nHe's me missing key people we talked to someone at Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters of their political reporter who's very familiar with all the people coming in and out of the state and he said that's exactly what someone should be doing at this time of year if they're interested in a presidential bid and indeed a lot of other democratic contenders are in town right now\nDo you get a sense is democratic voters in Iowa have any sense who ah governor Hickenlooper is at this\nPoint the ones I've talked to don't um he doesn't have a lot of national name id and even Hickenlooper will admit that's the case Bernie Sanders is here this weekend\nCalifornia senator Kamala Harris is hosting an event Monday\nNew Jersey senator Cory Booker was here recently so there's a lot of competition then you have Joe Biden and you have all of this war and so he he hasn't really push it through all those names but Hickenlooper said that's not the Gulf this trip he's really trying to get a feel of the state of Iowa where they are right now\nYou went to one of the governors events in Colorado He has a a fairly low key persona um tries to kind of come across as very\nNon partisan did you get any sense that he um might be talking a little bit differently outside the state\nI really didn't that was the message she was getting here he was talking about the oil and gas industry working with environmental groups when it came to reducing methane emissions\nTalking about his work with Governor key thick on health care policy and trying to bridge that partisan divide\nAnd listening to people collaborating he said we collaborate at the speed of trust you know so it's this idea that you really do have to reach across the aisle and\nLooked at people with different backgrounds in yourself and try to find that common ground and that's a message he's tried to highlight as governor\nAnd I think that will be a big part of his pitch to Iowa and the political reporter I talked to said that could play well in Iowa he's not from a coast he's from the middle of the country and not too far away from the state and they might like that approach\nOkay so he may be able to Iowa voters as sort of the middle of the road candidate but what challenges do you think he'll face putting himself out on the national stage\nNow someone's going to have to appeal to progressive voters really energized\nDemocrats also attract more moderate folks\nWhen Bernie Sanders arraigned had a very clear message and things like you know first of all health care and you know really people were rallying around him and Hillary had her supporters so\nYou know what can he can upper find to really get people excited about ... you know even he will say he's not going to have the traditional democratic constituencies so ... he find a different path well ... thank you how can you talk to you\nThat CPR betcha Brooklyn speaking with editor Megan Verlee about governor Hickenlooper his trip to Iowa this weekend where he's laying the groundwork
