monkeys are no longer allowed to eat bananas\nAnd the pandas are getting pellets instead of plums in fact ... has been phased out completely that's because the fruit that humans have selectively bread over the years has become so full of sugar does use fruit carrying animals were becoming obese and losing teeth\nSo how did fruit gets so sugary and what does that mean for us humans we're putting those questions to food writer and author Frederick Kaufman who joins us now welcome to the program\nOh hi how are you a great thanks um so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen since about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agricultural human beings have been messing around with the ... plant what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which ... which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cross breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this is going to go to mediate leader the sex life of plants that apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the main dates to remember here is Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states play a passes the plant patent act\nAnd from that point forward the idea is we're trying to\nEncourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them sweeter and to make the batter a and\nAlso to make them see list to take their sex away in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually take the sex drive of a plant away when you take away it feeds it actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\n[noise] when you read about how fruit um has impacted the zoo animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean\nAs I say for years now we've been lobbying these natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelon dish\nThe full of just bright red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature of the tomatoes you find in nature are tiny and tasteless\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of them are better as people don't realize that everything that we're seeing in the in the supermarket they're like superstars are like supermodels and and it leaves athletes like LeBron James that's what we're looking at the supermarket\nShe'll let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the ... well it doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farmhouse food stopping food is part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking and less good for us\nI I think that the argument among dieticians is is that is the yes the higher sugar content\nIs robbing a food of a lot of it's a nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection through our food that somehow if we equal rights we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row perfectly glistening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I Want that\n... but ... is still good for humans\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to eat is probably the best the best advice\nFrederick Kaufman is a food journalist and author thank you very

live\nFor a view from the Democrats we're joined now from California by Charles Chamberlain executive director of the liberal packed democracy for America welcome to the program they'd rather be pulling this week shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared [noise] what do you make of that\nDemocrats had the momentum scenes they lost it\nBut yeah I'm not surprised that uh it's changed a bit of courses tightening we're past Labor Day this was when people start paying attention to election\nAs the Republicans I continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole that they've dug for themselves with the Kavanaugh appointment I'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten which is where we've been for the last six months this certainly turned it up to an eleven or a hundred\nBut this was a pretty brutal loss for the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the terms with a huge loss\nThat's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house we don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court a and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the the democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against it to fight regardless of whether or not they're going to win we fought on principles and on values that's what the American public wants to see from us and that's why they're going to reward us on election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what whether it be over allegations of sexual misconduct in sexual assault or whether it be on his on his record\nRight but what's wrong with that to both reasons are valid a he has a terrible right wing partisan record he was perjured himself he is a terrible judicial temperament and he's also been credibly accused of sexual assault any one of those for reasons are completely legitimate reasons to keep this guy off the court\nAnd the reason why they needed is tight fight tooth and nail every day to try to defeat him win or lose\nWe've seen in recent polls that women on this specifically white women and specifically suburban white women\nAre leaning now more towards the Democrats but women were outraged when the Access Hollywood tape came out a but white women went for Trump and helped him win what do you think that makes twenty Eighteen different\nI think that we have a very a much more exciting\nA and engage democratic bays across across the board ah we have an understanding that the future of the Democratic party anti America is with the leadership of black and brown people of color or throughout this country and the progressive whites are a part of that coalition but we can't depend on the idea that\nUh the white women are going to save us if you look across this country that's what we're seeing and that's where the future is\nAh what are you running on I mean when you're going out in this last month how are you getting people out to the polls what are you telling them\nSaid the two biggest issues one is check on Trump's we've actually got to send some people to Congress that are going to fight Trump right now with Republicans controlling the house and in the Senate\nOr the you know they've got what ever they need to get whatever they want a it's time that America puts a check on Trump and that's what we're messaging and people are responding to but it's not just about Trump's also about our vision for America and that's why you see campaigns that are running on issues like Medicare for all inclusive populism\nReally succeeding better ... put a Texas roaring\nDigits between him right between Ted Cruz and the way he's been able to do that is because he was running a powerful people powered campaign on issues and a vision for America like

homophobic racist comments\nAnd we need to get down to the business of leading our country and who better to do that than women on both sides of the aisle\nIn this last month what are you running on what's your pitch to getting people out to the very simple\nYour vote matters you are going to be able to have a government that you want we're due process manners or constitutional values or reinforce and where we make sure that the threatening wave of socialism from the left is stopped\nMissy Scheuer runs the conservative ... list speaking with us from Texas thank you so much thank you live\nAnd for view from the Democrats we're joined now from California by Charles Chamberlain executive director of the liberal pack democracy for America welcome to the program for having me pulling this week shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared [noise] what do you make of that Democrats had the momentum scenes they lost it\nYeah I'm not surprised that it's changed a bit of courses tightening we're past Labor Day this was when people start paying attention to elections as the Republicans continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole that they've done for themselves with the Kavanaugh appointment I'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten\nWhich is where we've been through the last six months this certainly turned it up to an eleven or a hundred\nBut this was a pretty brutal loss for the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the midterms with a huge loss\nThat's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house we don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court ah and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the the democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against it to fight regardless of whether or not they're going to win we fought on principles and on values that's what the American public wants to see from us and that's why they're going to reward us and election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what whether it be over allegations of sexual misconduct in sexual assault or whether it be on his on his record\nRight but what's wrong with that to both reasons are valid a he has a terrible right wing partisan record he was perjured himself he has a terrible judicial temperament and he's also been credibly accused of sexual assault any one of those for reasons are completely legitimate reasons to keep this guy off the court\nAnd the reason why they needed is tight fight tooth and nail everyday to try to defeat him win or lose\nWe've seen in recent polls that women on this specifically white women and specifically suburban white women are leaning now more towards the Democrats but women were outraged when the Access Hollywood tape came out a white woman went for Trump and helped him win what do you think that makes twenty Eighteen different\nI think that we have a very a much more exciting a and engage democratic ... across the board a we have an understanding that the future of the Democratic party anti America is with the leadership of black and brown people of color or throughout this country and the progressive\nWhites are a part of that coalition but we can't depend on the idea that uh the white women are going to save us if you look across this country that's what we're seeing and that's where the future as\nUh what are you running on I mean when you're going out in this last month how are you getting people out to the polls what are you telling them\nYeah I said the two biggest issues one is check on Trump's we've definitely got to send some people to Congress that are going to fight Trump right now with Republicans controlling the house and in the Senate\nOr the you know they've got what ever they need to get whatever they want a it's time that America puts a check on Trump and that's what we're messaging and people are responding to but it's not just about Trump's also about our vision for America and that's why you see campaigns that are running on a issues like Medicare for all inclusive populism\nReally succeeding Beto O'Rourke has put a Texas roaring digits between him right between Ted Cruz and the way he's been able to do that is because he was running a powerful people powered campaign on issues and a vision for America like

things a rally well Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the newest associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court Trump was off to Topeka NPR's camera keys traveled with the president and joins us now good morning Tam good morning\nA this rally was on the schedule before the final cabinet vote in fact the president watched it from air force one you were there time what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up\nAfter that he took some questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that\nWomen [noise] work out what happened [noise] go out and I think that's sort of women\nI feel we're in many ways it is so a lot of women that are suffering from\nThat to an echo of something that he said at a rally last week a in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory\nAnd Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that that turn that rally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points across the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally of this isn't your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that a parent in the crowd with these values notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds pre Kevin up\nWell they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really fascinating when President Trump talked about Kavanaugh they cheered when President Trump talked about how terrible the Democrats are\nThey went ... wild here is just an example of one of the many things that President Trump said you don't hand\nBatches during our students\nAnd you don't get power do an angry left wing mob and that's what they because [noise]\nReally just sort of ... you know hate the other team feel that came about every time a President Trump even just said the word Democrat to it was pretty remarkable\nCurious town a rally in Kansas isn't really something meant to uh to use a campaign term expand the map this is his base these are the people that he has already persuaded why go to Kansas\nThe president is going to a bunch of states where he won in a big way\nYou can just that imagine what that person looks like so in that sense I feel like they're giving me a part of them selves even if it's a piece of art ... up before\nWe say goodbye and I I wanted to ask if there is a particular movement from us and NATO partied out on your
