harder waiting for you because you're the string you must have grown ups can write I did\nGet her out of the game yeah I started taking on a few years old two years old\nI mean how big are they in these since how are those really small they're like really small like a ruler yeah like a real are and how old were you when it was like oh she's good you're good at this the eggs you shouldn't that my mom and your or my dad [noise]\nI was two years old I thought it was very good at getting really\nI thought that too but I was really wrong [noise] you're\nGonna do you think you're going to be

I assume and growing up in vale everybody's cheese wrap\nRight mostly yeah right I mean you it's an expensive sport do you want to be cautious about saying everybody skis because some people don't have the luxury but\nI just and I fell in love and support when I started this ... once I was allowed to start training gates around six years old then I really felt rubber chairs old\nNASCAR I don't know [noise] yeah but they were not dry period between three and six\nAnd I can't really know what I never understood the old days when I Would watch the Olympics that they weren't supposed to hit the ... the singing that's\nBecause let me translate from Paula [noise]\nWhat she means is that now when you want someone like yourself you're you're actually running over the poles the gate the gay knocking it over as you pass to get their mentality thank you in the olden days ... but the old days it seems like we weren't allowed to touch it or ... or\n... yeah well the in the old days of them do and don't really hurt do\nThat and people still tried and they got raises and now they're plastic and they have the\nI don't know it it didn't fall over when you hit it but you still get brings is so that\nThe whole point of it for is not about hitting the gate and it's about getting down as fast as\nPossible so why not use like colored snow\nGear or ... I don't know [noise]\nI actually I Want to send me because I've watched a lot of ... and and it seems so intense when you're up there at the top of the mountain\nAnd there is that most of the cameras right on you and there were you thinking as you're about to argue thinking would I Would think would just oh no oh no oh\nNo are you ... a lot of times I'm thinking I'm going to die\nWhile it just\nBecause it's you know I've been scary things for a while so I'm confident but every now and then there's a moment where you like\nThis is I'm freezing\nI'm wearing a standing next to it so I'm pretty much naked [noise] I\nReally ugly helmet on and I've you know painting it to make it look pretty but everybody knows how much\nThey're not wait a minute are you telling me you're up there like at the Olympics with the literally the eyes of the world on you and you're you're getting ready to ski for Olympic gold and you're thinking to yourself is home with his not flat or\nMake\nWhat have you back ages three ...\n[noise]\nReally the dark years I\nWe get to talk to but we have asked are you today [noise]\nTo play a game we're calling\nIt the cheese after so you might think downhill ski racing is dangerous and then you have never seen the Gloucester shared cheese rolling races\nIn Britain competitors her older body done a frightening speed limit snow stuff mind you to pitch in the fall chasing a wheel of cheese sure wonder is thirty three people to go to the hospital for the winner gets\nTo keep the wheel of cheese\nSome metal loving it we're going to get three questions about the great Gloucester cheese races get to\nDo with our ... one of our listeners co counsels voice on their voice mail bill who was Olympian McHale is you're from playing for Randall invest for August in Denver, Colorado\nFirst question if you're ever spend ... men and women gather the top of this very steep hill in Gloucester and then they rate to see who gets the cheese according to local experts the best strategy for winning the race is one way to the back of the parents for everyone to fall down the hill and hurt themselves then slowly walked down the hill to win the race\nBe get drunk first foresee lie down across the hill and then just roll the strategy being known as being the cheese [laughter]\nI'm going to have a very well okay here's the reasoning\nYou're rolling sideways down how I mean everybody did this kid and you can't you have no idea what's going on you know which way up or down and you always somehow got sideways and so you'd end up just rolling sideways across to which isn't very good and then there's always the one crazy person who's going to make it to the ... you know wait at the top run\nYour in your heart\nOK you're going to go for big bureaus corrected it [noise]\nReally fees and most people believe that nobody entirely sober could hurdle him or herself don't it don't get too drunk so just drunk enough as it was it's good to get one right\nThrough a lot of injuries are racers go flying the videos like I said her horrifying so last year the local authorities tried to stop the events they tried to stop it from happening by doing what day telling the eighty six year old woman who makes the cheeses\nThat she would be liable for any injury [noise] be passing a law requiring all chooses to be manufactured in a square shape [noise]\nOr Steve just bulldozing that he'll swear [noise]\nHey hey confidently choosing it\nYeah I like your ... you're right yeah [noise]\n\nThe economy in the ... or we'll\nDown here on where\nYou were right\nDiane for ages it has made the cheeses for the event for years and beliefs came to do some warned her that if anybody was badly hurt to hold her responsible should made the trees anyway\nResponse to that cannot be shut in public radio\n[noise] German\nSitting in a charming don't do that would be like British accent [noise]\nWinter this year Josh shepherd [noise] bus shocked organizers when he announced right after he wanted to choose what they she didn't mean to compete in the race who's going to watch it but he tripped and\nDumb [noise] everybody\nBe he was a quote blacks to sexual unintended to marry the trees\n[noise]\nSee actually he doesn't even really like to choose\nThe again you're good [noise]\nSo we majors Rainville with Russia and that that drove a farm price was secured the farm vote afterward that led to the belt of hyperinflation\nAnd women were in the streets protesting the president butter there was horse meat showing up in the butcher shops and people were really upset\nSo he hired girl Buzz Bissinger for do an agricultural economist William them and gave him the job of drive down food prices do what ever\nCan to make food is cheapest possible in America and he did he figured out a new way to subsidize agriculture he persuaded farmers to get big or you know only grow corn and soybeans and with the result that uh we\nIncrease the amount of corn we grow from four billion to ... billion bushels and\nSoda got really cheap and meet got really cheap and we got really bad it's almost want to ... and early ... bought yeah\nAnd then in addition to all the ... in in your latest book in the defense of food in defense of food do you take on like the nutritionist people been telling it like every day we need\nMore of this and the next day they say no you don't need more that were very confused\nAbout food I think which you know which is weird I mean what other species need experts to tell them how to eat [noise]\nRight if it's a good career\nHow many times I've got to tell my dog to get his hat or the garbage can\nWhat should we be eating food [laughter]\nYou know it gets your book [laughter]\nIt's very hard actually for us now to know what food is because there are all these edible food like substances now compete with food and the supermarket so a lot of the book is helping people distinguish between the edible food like substances right then the real like for example one of my role does food does not come with the prize\nSetting good they are ... I'm going to you though [laughter]\nWait wait cracker jacks do though I don't understand why [laughter]\nOkay but\nLet me let me ask you something one of the things that has made my life worth living is a ringing [laughter]\nI feel that it is food would you you are you going to tell me that's not food\nIs a few simple task to figure out of ... food or how many ingredients as a ring being half\nOne [laughter]\nYa know the right there [laughter]\nI remain rich chocolate recording us\nI think I Would look at the time that creamy creamy too is not cream\nIf if the R.
