{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "As election issues I mean I think what what President Trump and the Republicans have done is disgraceful I mean for example the grandstanding in recent weeks over this caravan of or Central American refugees which if you listen to Trump and the Republicans it's like a horde of barbarians were going to invade America and rape and pillage and\nWe have to send five thousand troops down to the border to stop this caravan of fewer than five thousand people many of them women and children I mean this is just the lowest base it kind of politics you could imagine lying on share and resentment\nAnd I would hope uh that voters at least in house races\nWill make Republicans pay a price for what they're doing because I think it is terribly destructive to our social fabric\nYou know I write a lot of my book the corrosion of conservatism about how I don't recognize the Republican Party anymore because it has ceased to be a conservative party it's really become a white nationalist party under Trump's influence and if there's going to be any celebration in the near term for the Republican Party I think it has to begin\nWith massive and repeated droppings at the ballot box because that is the only way that Republican politicians\nWill get the message that picking on minority groups is not the way to win political advantage\nMacs are you surprised by the silence\nFrom Republican leaders who had been on the hill longer than President Trump has even been in politics and I'm thinking of people like\nSpeaker of the house Paul Ryan or Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or the Senator John Cornyn of Texas people who'd been there who were stalwart\nAre proponents and and leaders in the Republican Party who have basically either gone Newt\nFor gone along with gusto a with what the president has been doing\nIt's shocking the the speed with which Republicans have sold out\nThere for reported beliefs and not just sold them out but eagerly joined\nIn in Trump's extremist rhetoric I mean one of the most shocking unless reported things that's happened ah in the last month or so is the fact that Chuck Grassley you know good old Chuck Grassley\nWho's been in the Senate cents roughly Riley Olympic error right one of the Republican old bulls ought to be one of the responsible members of the Republican Party\nHe endorsed this crackpot theory that George Soros was behind the anti government protests which was essentially an anti Semitic dog whistle of the kind that Republicans increasingly used to to motivate their voters now\nI mean Chuck Grassley I mean my goodness give me a break and ah you know then you have so\nMany others that you mentioned who don't necessarily endorsed these these crazy conspiracies but don't challenge them either I mean and I think about people who have gone entirely sign that we never hear about for example Lamar Alexander senator from Tennessee or\nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio these are very mainstream Republican I served in previous Republican administration they\nHad been in Washington for decades okay I could not imagine that they possibly think that Donald Trump as qualified or that they approve of what he is doing\nAnd yet they don't there's not a peep out of them to protest ... I mean it's just\nShocking and disgraceful to buy in my opinion\nAnd for additional historical context Ronald Reagan\nBasically espouse the idea that anyone who wants to be an American is probably going to be good for our country because they want to be here and they have the clock to be in and the grey which usually the more ambitious people in the world do\nAnd that even comes back to the birthright citizenship question as I understand it one motivation for passing it way back in the Eighteen sixties was so that immigrant families would feel loyalty to the United states\nNot to their countries of origin with birthright citizenship those big waves of immigrants coming in before entering Ellis Island\nWouldn't be colonizing the United states on behalf of the original countries they would be made Americans part of the body of this nation and now Trump once the opposite to call them invaders when all they want so desperately is precisely to be American ...\nUh and very quick point I mean that's it's ironic that Donald Trump accuses Democrats of wanting open borders which they do not but you know who won and open borders Ronald Reagan he talked about how his dream\nWas to erase the borders between the United states and Mexico and Canada and create a true open market of North America so ... ... yeah and open borders Koch right\nHears those words open borders\nYeah I'm ... I I keep coming the more we talk about this the more I keep asking the question and in the minute that we have left I Would love to have both of you respond\nThat the the the the hate and the demagoguery that have just been unleashed is it possible to put it back in the bottle trying to start with you real quick\nOvertime but so far a running against immigrants has worked for Donald Trump that got him elected he's doubling down on that strategy for now we will find out next week if people are putting it back in the bottle himself smacks\nWell I think it'll be a less successful strategy over time has come a majority minority nation but it's going to be hard to reach these toxins out of our body politic and we really need to try to do that I think we almost need a campaign like we did to stigmatize smoking to stigmatize racism and xenophobia nativism I thought that\nThis is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one of them Casey afar Denver fourteen Ninety am Casey is the Boulder ...

investigation has been initiated the eighty nine year old had been transferred to the penitentiary near Morgantown West Virginia the day before his death\nI take that as a massive compliment because that style of writing is so deliberate and I wanted the kids to improvise but they were obsessed\nWith becoming great actors and becoming these characters and learning this screenplay and for me it took three years in twenty draft you deliberately right every I'm In like an expletive\nWithin reason behind it well really and uh-huh\nAnd that's very intentional and that's you know capturing very realistic dialogue that seems improvise is a complement to these young performers acting and you know really deliberate thought in how these people speak to one another\n[noise] did you learn to speak that way\nYes I think I was taught and maybe culturally we were taught at that time if you're a man and you express your feelings are you expressed that something hurts you then you should be made fun of\nAnd that kind of repression leads to anger and anger leads to bad behavior and I think I wanted to show a film about young men with an inability to express themselves\nBut the thing is like you or\nAs a child and then as a young teen you were writing like skips for The Simpsons I'm not on a professional ... you were just like writing that's for The Simpsons so you ... yet we had both ambition and also a a facility for words you lived in a world the words\nYou wanted to communicate on the page and I'm thinking what must have been like for you to have this urge to write to communicate to make written jokes\nReferring to pop culture with characters in it I mean that's what The Simpsons is all about and at the same time feel like but you're not supposed to express yourself\nBecause you're a boy yeah and I'm not I'm not victimizing myself I think as a straight white male I have more privileged and I can't even comprehend of course yeah ... my last\nYear you were kind of suppressing something that came really natural to you that you really valued\nRight and I also I have always been expected to be a certain type of thing and I played right into that out of my own insecurity as a person and I as a kid was very funny identifies a writer first and foremost in my life\nAfter just rather person uncle and stuff like that\nFirst occupation I Would lift it would be a writer [noise] and then going into a culture where that kind of verbal communication or emotional communication is mocked and then on top of that\nYou know even when I became a well known public figure I think the duality of comedy and being overweight and all this stuff allowed for jokes and punches to be made about me and towards me\nWhich turned me angrier which made me communicate worse\nAnd then when you're funny\nYou become a bit mean all speak for myself you think of the thing to hurt the other person 'cause you assume they're about to hurt you\nIt all plays into each other in this very weird cyclical thing and then I became famous as an overweight comedian and then I felt like I wasn't given the respect as a human being\nA lot of humor as like self deprecating humor and self deprecating humor doesn't go over and that kind of like teen masculine I'm like athletic culture\nI say this as an outsider to all of that [laughter] but but anyway did you have an impulse toward self deprecating humor but no I knew that that wouldn't be appropriate to the scene that you were in I think\nMy point is I'm trying to even in my twenties even going through a career publicly going through my twenties publicly\nEither being mean and defensive or self deprecating to a point where you're beating yourself up to feel like you deserve a seat at the table are both unhealthy for me because\nObviously being mean makes you feel bad when you go home if you have a heart which I Do and then and being defensive or beating yourself up gives you a real problem with your self esteem\nAnd the way I related that in mid nineties or tried to express that within the character Stevie is this person's currency in his life is his ability to take abuse and to take pay\nAnd I don't want to give away the end of the film but the film along with my own journey has been a tremendous amount about self acceptance\nDo his issues are are different than yours and his way of resolving is different than yours but that's the the core emotional issue that you're getting at\nYeah is that we all beat ourselves up I explore male self abuse in the film was something that I found after doing a lot of research very troubling and fascinating\nUm literal sibling abuse troubling and fascinating and watch skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits whether inflicted from someone else or themself\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something\nPunishing about that in self punishing about that and there's a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you\nWhere are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter]\nYeah I'm I'm at my scars\nAren't have cars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which I related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this is it my story I wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real\nSense of hope through community even if that Comey has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up in and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAh yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use or dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now\nI landed a kick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's set among a group of skate boarders in the Nineteen nineties we'll be right back\nAnd we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early\nScratch here's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignored the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote The Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter] who is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because I have a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dog\nYou know I got like an aging off of that and then ... me to judge and brought me to read for that\nLittle one line and four year old virgin and I don't know then I stuck around\nSo there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about this this wind fits so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity an attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to guess the line I'm going to ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and I'm ... you're you're you're a high school kid and this and you know you're not part of the cool crowd and all and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series maniac\nI Love her yeah I from a distance I Love her to [laughter] from the decision\nOf your body has the honor for as a person could use a an actor\nGood good good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party while her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just said you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero and so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character\nOr about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea that you leave and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version of this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say you know how girls say I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that guy we could be that mistake\nSo gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about ... teenage boys an adult men try to get girls and women trunk or drug to get them into bad\nI mean it's literally horrified [laughter] what a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... braided that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping with him\nAnd that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time in the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at\nUs times change that was never right\nBut for some reason it was okay to make a joke you about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you\nAwful [laughter] but yeah it does sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded upsetting uh yeah [laughter]\nI was deeply upsetting I you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I\nNot that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity\nTo understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought about as a reality 'cause it's not my experience and so now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise] so um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have evolved you know and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I I think things have changed\n[noise] yeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is that I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know those people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\n[noise] why don't we take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter his directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back this is fresh air\nThis is a test of the emergency alert system\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThis has been a test of the emergency alert system on Colorado Public radio [noise]\nMhm\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from YouTube originals and roadside attraction presenting fiber club

if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director in this directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like um come into manhood on screen because she was started in your teens I'm super bad you are right in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you started\nPlaying more dramatic roles you\nKnow in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatic low\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... who told me\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim ah\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is\nAs a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we hear a scene\nFrom a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese\nAnd written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he was approached by Donny aids off played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene\n... [noise]\nRight I mean\nIt was built for them to\nActually see that call around\nWell you know what I mean I think we live in the\nTwelfth floor yeah well for your for civil affairs a little ... [laughter] what do you do [noise]\nOne of women for forty two stockbroker stocking [noise] children under ... good for you so right [noise] there's a lot of money [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "31"}
