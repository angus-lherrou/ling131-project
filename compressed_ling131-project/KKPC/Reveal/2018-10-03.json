Chicago\nTime is running out for finding any more survivors from friday's earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia the official death toll from the disaster now tops twelve hundred and climbing NPR's Julie McCarthy made her way to one devastated area by traveling with an army eight and security convoy\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce and very little to do with directly with commerce and if in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce or you have\nThe census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have the a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day that collects all of a sudden we're able to parse the data in in ... and use the data in ways we've never been able to use it\nAnd that's a seemingly leave something that the that the person the Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not interested in he sees the job is kind of like she trade negotiator which is odd because we have a cheap trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like data pools that um the Commerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census\nAnd the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on the census um I I don't know if there's a definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen cents is whether it's on there and\nWhile they're still they're still argument about whether they're going to insert on the sets a question of establishing whether the person who's reply to the census as a citizen what we'll do is queer the responses to the census\nLet's let's talk about why 'cause a lot of people will be afraid to answer that question\nWill be if people would be afraid to answer the question that people will be suspicious of the motives of the census takers\nRight and and a lot of immigrants live with somebody who isn't here legally some even if you're here legally if you know someone who isn't you might be afraid to say that you're an immigrant\nI think at this point that even people who are here who are legal who are fearful so actually looking back up a second they haven't even the gun to prepare them for the census I mean the the the real problem with is access is that it's way behind schedule when it hasn't been budget it for\nSo there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off is another question in there and starting this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially with the nose from answering it\nAnd what are the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the census\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the ... congressional districts so we're districts need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn\nOf late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the data that the government collects is researchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example um we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country\nIf the data on prescription drugs had not been made available and not been possible\nIf we don't have a picture of what the society looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that will occur\nSo that people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states in big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you um\nAre you a U.S citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census and the states and cities fear their political representation will be\nCalculated incorrectly because they will be misrepresented in a sense is if this question discourages immigrants from\nAnswering so\nWilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do all that data and I don't want to sound ages here but I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWe know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who try to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who are brought in to try to explain how the department work to him found that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed\nSo even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment an additive add\n... became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the forms rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers it had been\nUnder the Ford rich list all along which then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice if he was very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if

A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did during the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and this includes National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was a versus the biggest part of no\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few may raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law any bills actually I think are quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments\nAnd receive the government for their ... the Obama administration\nIs so the bottom of Mr Asian has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with his ego virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic\nHere's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems\nThis is what this department does\n... this is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner told them to and the jak cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey it put cushion his father in jail but that really doesn't explain it I don't say because\nThere was no reason Trump had to listen to cushion there and there's also no reason you couldn't just just fired Christian kept everybody else on board I think what happened was that a number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor or were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs and the government\nAnd they were left off the list because the transition timid vet it all these people and found the problems with them so some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded crop to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened and a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a he'd been terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\nSo was there like a last ... Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was is that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was a law they had to do it they didn't have any choice\nFor pay no attention didn't take it seriously with irritated when every heard money was being spent but no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win\nSo Jared Kushner although we over saw it kind of closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused\nI think it ... he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done if you're just\nJoining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist rest and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back\nThis is fresh air\nSupport comes from the borough chamber orchestra of Colorado performing music of handle and parcel London connection to concerts on October sixth and seventh more information at B.

just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money by the big short and the undoing project and all of which have been best sellers\nHis new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAfter President Trump was inaugurated he sent in what you described as a small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings\nFrom people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listened politely and didn't take notes and the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team we send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fun basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually a direct connection between\nThe undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos too risky who were studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or risk of a terrorist attack or the you know one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches\nPlutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach is effectively taking lots of you know wanting to million are wondering how hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it caught him into ... shows you that people don't really feel this\nAnd that insight as what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal",
