C. theater Carrick\nNPR's Sylvia Poggioli has more from Rome\nThe pro will try to determine how Mick Carrick advance through church ranks despite allegations known to the Vatican since the year two thousand that he slept with seminarians and young priest in July after an investigation the pope accepted mechanics resignation and ordered him to a life of prayer independence\nIn August in a bombshell letter former Vatican diplomat archbishop ... accused Francis and numerous church officials of having turned a blind eye to eye ... sexual misconduct for years\nI find it a little unusual honestly the premise of his argument if the issue is that too much marijuana is getting out of the legal system into the illegal one abolishing the regulatory legal schemes only seems to exacerbate the problem\nIt is possible that he could see the Colorado now with legalization in place for many years has problems with its regulatory scheme and he does want to crack down\nUm it seems though is that he might be able to achieve his ends if he is sincere about them by working with people in the state to make sure that those problems don't continue\nLet's step back here you've got the federal government's a forming this committee to look at it marijuana and what what might their end goal be do you have any sense from the creation of this committee or any of its\nUh proceedings what ... what they want to achieve\n[noise] given the fact that\nThey've asked for data with negative trends and they said they wanted to possibly present this information to the White House or to the president himself\nIt couldn't be that they are in the early stages of an effort to run essentially a campaign against legalization to make people concerned about the harms of marijuana they said that they want the agencies to portray it and show how it is a national threat\nA security threat a health threat and they could use that to try ... efforts to legalize marijuana\nIn other states when I followed up uh with the White House and asked if they were looking for any positive information about legalization who had started at a this committee or what is being done now and what's coming up uh they didn't answer those questions so it's very hard to assess what their next steps going to be\nDominic thanks so much for sharing your reporting with us\nRyan thank you for having me Dominic Holden of buzzfeed his report that the Trump Administration is running a marijuana committee prompted Colorado senator Michael Bennet to raise concerns it's misleading people about marijuana\nBennett set it

just retired\nPerhaps that sounds like a dream or like winning the lottery not so people are doing this right now because of their own financial decision making they're sometimes called radical savers and they're part of a larger movement called fire financial independence slash retire early\nThe concept is pretty straightforward save as much as you can as quickly as you can\nNow what's radical about that well they're putting around Seventy percent of what they make into retirement each year\nCarl Jansen of Longmont a radical saver about six years ago he set a goal to leave his job as a computer programmer it's now been a year and a half since he retired and he's only forty three is that right Karl\nI'm actually forty four forty four okay seal and nice time to say you've retired or perhaps for something or is it true that a bad day at work is what got you looking into this idea of radical saving\nIt is absolutely true I had no idea that any of this was going to happen or my life would turn out like this I plan to work till ... sixty five and then I had a very very bad day at work when I was thirty seven and I I hit up Google and at school how do I retire early and up came all these people who are living as\nA obscures crazy life ah one guy said you'd quit work when he was thirty one at at first I kinda thought the whole thing was a scam this is the Internet who is this guy what are they going to try to sell me and then it turns out just just pretty much a math problem\nYou figure out how much money you need to spend you figure out how much money you need based on it and you do some calculus\nThen once you hit your numbers are that's it that's a very ... over simplification of it but it's it's just math\nWe'll dig into the math and just a bit but would you call this an impulse decision I mean we all have bad days at work\n[laughter] there was there was an impulse decision I made the sole decision to change my life and about the course of one hour I'm very thankful spouse went along with it but yeah it I I have to say it was very very stressful I lost ten pounds and that we do to stress\nOkay let's unpack them at just a bit first of all I have to assume you were making a healthy income to begin with and is that necessary to do what you did\nA I did make a healthy income especially at the end of my career it did not start out that way my first job paid be thirty six thousand a year and if you had I was making a little over a hundred thousand a year because he rented the six figures yes so I don't think it's completely this is Syria will make life harder but there's other ways to make money we made\nWe foot tall says as a side hustle so there's a million ways to make money in this economy\nSo how do you begin to put away is it roughly Seventy percent of your income in to savings what kinds of changes did you make in your life to make that happen\nYeah so I've always been a pretty frugal guy but we did make one big one and\nAnd that one was we had a huge house to house it was almost five thousand square feet we had a toilet for all four members or family member in the home so the first thing we did is we weren't very happy in the neighborhood to begin with so we saw that and move to a much smaller house that was the main thing we had to do\nAfter that it was small two weeks like going out to eat less ah maybe travel heck in using credit card points to travel in walking maybe not driving as much\nOkay so you cut your overhead by downsizing you're home\nYou got your fuel expenses I'm hearing and eating out which gets awfully expensive if you buy a drink with a meal especially sure and how long did it take you from that decision points that you were going to do this\nTo having enough money to retire and what if I may ask what is your goal ...\nOkay so Michael amount was a million dollars and no debt and with that in mind I already had substantial savings I grew up with financial insecurities so I always mixed up my retirement accounts so at the time I made this decision I head about six hundred thousand dollars saved up and it took me about\nA four years to accumulate the million dollars that I needed to feel comfortable with leaving my job\nOkay and the million dollars make you feel comfortable why that's enough of a pot of money to earn interest on that it supports you in retirement or what yeah that's it\nThere was a study that said once you can live off four percent of the money you have saved up in an average year you could stop working so we figured out we spend about forty thousand dollars a year so once we had a million dollars we would have enough to leave\nWhat do you miss your old lifestyle though oh like what is the sacrifice yeah I don't think\nIt's a sacrifice you know a a frugal simple life is a happy life I thought I Would be unhappy when I moved away from the big house but it turns out that the community and the people around us or what makes us happy as a if I had to pick one thing would be the camaraderie camaraderie with my co workers I enjoyed them\nAnd I enjoyed the core nature out of my work but I could still do that and I can still write code and I still do that just on my own terms so\nThat's a key question whether or not you're going to like life in retirement I Wonder if that kept you up at night\nThey did that was the main reason I [laughter] I stayed at my work in another year after I get humiliated enough money and it was because I was so afraid of being poured\nIn looking back now two months later after I left my job I realize how silly though is I don't have a I probably have Thirty years of of life left and maybe fifty years of life overall and I'm never going to be able to fit in everything I wanted to just not enough time\nAgain you have a wife and two daughter and I do and what has this meant for your family life and wonder also just how your wife felt about this journey you you had to go on together\nYeah I'll talk to your second question first I'm so thankful that I have an understanding wife who trust me with a math but she also saw how stressed I was so she's like if you figure this out go for it I trust you with my daughters is made life a way better in the summer I can spend time with my older daughter knows where the ... 'cause I could\nSit there and work on mess with her for two hours uh she runs cross country I run with her my younger one we're we're reading together so the time I get to spend with them is so much better and that's probably the main gift I have\nAn immigrant story it's an immigrant Samir\nYou and your brother are immigrants yeah right you were born in South Africa\nYeah my ... my whole family's immigrants my ... my best friends growing up early immigrants\nI have so many perspectives on\nWhat it means to be an American I see so many sides to it just because when we moved here everyone was just like this is an easing America's incredible we moved in the height of apartheid so it was like wow like this is an incredible place you know\nIt would have been in such a stark contrast\nVery yeah in through a lot of ... there yeah my friends that moved from India at the same age and other places you know but now I mean there's a lot of crazy happening\nI and I mean I we've been torn\nThe whole world and I've seen this in a lot of different countries and it's not just here but the amount of racism and sexism and\nWe're not as as as forward is we out maybe saw\nAnd you feel that globally I feel like you know\nA\nA\nShow\nA\nRetired many songs as you had for this album how do you begin to whittle them down\nLet's be like picking a favorite child\n[noise] yeah it's like picking your favorite weird children it was a tough process at first and then I remember it was like the springs starting my season my pharmacy them starting so I had a lot of work going on you\nAre a farmer in addition to being a musician\nYeah farm like half the year so I remember I was plowing everything getting ready for the spring planting I remember I had my headphones on\nAnd I would just I knew that the record wanted to start with birth and I didn't know why and I knew how I wanted to end and so I Would just keep playing so now we're All right I'm not mad next and then keep when something I'm not mad and then you know forty four\nMiniature vinyl you know that's what we're always after forty four minutes we're going yeah twenty two each side pretty much okay yeah sometimes it can go a little longer left but I Want to\nPut up birth is ... ...
