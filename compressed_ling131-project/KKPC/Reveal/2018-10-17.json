I see yes I can go way back at every sort of February and we would go to grandpa and grandma would go with a horse or actually donkey drawn cart and we would go to a an animal fair and they're my grandfather\nWould go around and they were pens set up\nIn a park situation where little piglets were for sale and he would choose and really be careful about choosing he would usually choose to little piglets\nAnd uh uh you know kind of pick them up stretch their legs see that they would grow into big base because that's what you want to you know when you saw the you want a lot of meat and the bacon and the fat and all of that was needed for the family and then he would choose to put it in this little kind of\nBasket and bring them home and there was squeal all the way home and then the whole year of raising them and feeding them and seeing them grow until about November\nAnd ah November was usually the slaughter because it was a ... month and so the the the curing it in the in the slaughter of the animals you know every as as as you said every part was cured or save your preserved for for the ... the rest of the year to cook and to feed the family\nAnd it's usually as kids you know I was small we were just kind of runners helping whether it was to bring the hot water whether it was to bring towels whatever it was but we would be always around and there was always a commotion in in the courtyard\nThey were um a set of ... usually too\nThat will travel like like the traveling doctors if you will\nAnd these are laughter richer they ... they if they were slow to ... they came with their sharp knives and they're big aprons or of of a kind of this very thick canvas and uh the the whole time would get organized to anybody that had pigs\nAnd that wanted them Florida they would make a kind of a timeline as far as days the butchers would stay about two days within each household\nAnd are not only with the butcher in the household get involved but neighbors would help neighbors each day you know the the day that they were at our house all the neighbors came and helped would you ...\nI did you know as children children were were were always part of what was happening it wasn't like up with the children are way you know you were just part of life\nAnd Ah yes when they picked up the big you know the usually grandpa and some other\nKind of neighbors pick up the big each one by one of the the legs and brought it up on this plank of course that people were squealing or whatever we knew the time was coming so us kids would run and hide and then of course we've come back out and peak and see what's going on and then run again\nAnd uh but inevitably you know a ... we saw we saw the ... the big actually being\nKind of slaughtered and or whatever followed the fact that you know the blood was first elected and a\nGrandma with ... with right away collect as much as she got the blood they even sort of turned to the pig around so that the the actual exit of the blood would be on top of the pale\nAnd are slowly allow all of the blood to drain out a pig and you know that became blood sausages and now even as a child a\nMarried cook the your your grandmother would like to cook the blood and then put a lot of the reasons or would not some things in it at ...\nCorn meal sometimes rice to kind of been set it up and it would be this kind of savory sweet a mixture and then when the mixture became something like ... the you know nice and then with everything in it\nOr the season the ... river little solved by then uh the big had been a opened and and butchered in a sense of the pieces the testing was where the blockbusters you would go and\nBuy way I'm going to have you considered part of your job was cleaning out the intestine so that could be used for for blood such that must have been an unpleasant job\nWell it was that was saying you know not the children always are just kind of the the women was the woman's job you know one of the first thing so it was very um carefully done because you don't wanna punctured the intestines and and have all the\nInside of the intestine so that sort of a ... digested feces all of that you wanted an intact so he had to pull the whole intestines and that's what came out first the heart the lungs the test and all of the uh enters the few well\nAnd then the intestines\nSlowly that large intestines or the ... small intestines everything was kind of separated\nAnd uh and cleaned and cleaned thoroughly from the inside first the solid came out and then washed in and out of the inside and then they were soaked in water and vinegar to some extent and then they will use that as a casing for this blood sausage or for the regular sausages\nWe have just lost the entire Reagan audience [laughter] that was after our show again [laughter] but you know as as somebody who grew up in a city and basically if you were buying meat it was like in the refrigerator counter or the butcher shop [noise]\nI'm just trying to think of what it was like for you to raise the pig\nSee the pig slaughtered clean out the intestines watching the pig's blood cooking on the stove I mean you became like an excellent chef so obviously this didn't scare you away about meat or about cooking um did you ever like bond with the pigs and feel like oh no now we have to kill them\n... we did as children we did we had the same in the same sort of cycle\nThe chickens ducks the rabbits the goats you know I Love the bunny rabbit small rabbits when they came we played in the week cuddle them and whatever and you know two weeks later they were part of the dinner table and somehow you you this cycle of life you accepted\nYou bond you you learn you connect you helped to raise this little animals\nAnd they become adults animals or are they become food\nAnd you know one food is scarce every more so it's really appreciate it in a sense you know you are grateful to these animals you know you you kind of celebrate them in a way because they're giving us life\nAnd I think that the the cab yet here is respect respect for food yes we need to eat food but let's you know not waste that at all is respect respect the animals that feed us and so on the line I think that's that's all the the important element here because\nUh I continue to you know certainly cooked all kinds of lease and all that\nBut I Love animals and I respect him\nDo you still make blood sausage\nNo because it's very hard to to get you don't get you need to really a direct blood or without now\nYou know you can't sell just blood it has to be pasteurized and that meaning we entered it changes the texture and you don't get it a fresh by the time you get it no even those ... refrigerated frozen or whatever it takes a period of time and you know I don't relate to the same way\n[noise] so you grew up on the peninsula of history or on the ... as I said before and after World War two which switch from being part of Italy to being part of communist Yugoslavia the language where you live change to Croatian from Italian\nAnd the secret police are keeping an eye on your family the because go ahead\nAnd yes absolutely and the whole thing changed and I was just born in that period\nSo uh um you know I didn't notice this immediate change but what I did notice in growing is that there was two parts of my existence and that was the security part in the house whispering in Italian sometimes talking about religion\nAnd then the oppressive side growing under communism\nAnd having to follow the communist dogma they've changed our names\nUh we couldn't be I couldn't speak Italian openly\nCertainly not go to church or my mother was an elementary school teacher so she was really watched\nAnd and so you know the the whole kind of anti\nDemocratic ah dogma and is a a duration for a president or you have to ... and and you know the kind of one for all communism\nA\nDoctrine if you well you know everything became\nA communal farms were taken away my my father had a business with the two trucks and you know he certainly was deemed a capitalist the trucks were taken away he was the input in prison for about forty days until they clarified that he didn't have other\nAlternatives motives though for you know kind of undermining the communist stick a dogma that he wanted to you know to professor capitalism and so on so it was it was a tough tough period and and that's why I'm we ended up spending a lot of time\nThey helped you get passage to America they found you a hotel room to stay in when you first arrived they found a house or apartment for you to rent afterwards they helped your parents find jobs they gave him money and they didn't want to be repaid even though your mother insisted on paying them they wouldn't accept it [noise]\nUm [noise] but anyway so you were how old when you came to America to us\nI Will smoke Nineteen fifty eight didn't speak any English that you learned it within a year\nAnd then you were in school being like an outsider newcomer without any facility with English and always I imagine pretty hard for you and you still had to deal with food but with food and a foreign country\nWith very little money and no garden or animals or you know fruit trees or [laughter] any vet to deal with so how did the world of food changed for you in a matter of\nWell each each changed tremendously you're not twelve years old though\nYou are or at least I recall being very very I was happy I was so happy now finally we came up to a place where we are going to stay we are going to build their home\nAnd uh um I was excited about learning the language I was excited about becoming an American I was excited about making friends uh you know whose language I didn't know and I was excited also by the food ah you know I must say it initially at things like ...\nAnd [laughter] and all of that stuff from east me you know and and then like yo it off\n'cause I'm going to confess here my mother used to like yo does all the time I thought there were a little I don't know bitter and it'll like they'd be really sweet and I thought that they didn't taste quite right I was never a big fan but you love them I let him talking to you about your does by the way\n[laughter] I I ... I Love them because you know there you go you when you open this package and you get this kind of\nDelicious texture and ... you know we didn't have that you know or any desserts okay when it was the festivities we made it and it was limited and so on so you know to just be able to throw it in your car and bring it home and I still gets added in school\nAs wrapped in ... [laughter] I'm does yes I got to wrap [laughter]\nYes and so so I was I was amazed by all of that and I was excited so food was different a peanut butter and jelly I feel like it today and sometimes you know and I to be no butter and jelly ... uh I like is\nMy guest a chef cookbook author and restaurant tour and then he ... she hosts the PBS series ... kitchen\nAfter a break we'll talk about

household\nMaybe the graduate student or the retiree on a fixed income these are real people in your community who rely on Colorado Public radio and as much as you give to support your own listening\nYou are also giving to support their as I'd like to think of giving to CPR as an active selfishness and great generosity CPR dot org is how to give\nChoose the amount that works for you or pick up the phone and dial one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty and picture yourself in a four star hotel not far from the Thames\nAnd sounds pretty good you know we've been hearing from
