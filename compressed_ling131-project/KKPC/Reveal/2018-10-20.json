American migrants from entering the country but Mexico did allow in anyone with a visa or passport and allowed some people do apply for refugee status in Mexico\nPeople desperate to get anywhere using ropes and boats and other flirtation devices trying to find a way to Mexican soil some hope to reach the U.S earlier this week Trump tweeted he would send us troops to close the border is Mexico does not succeed in stopping the migrants and here's an event that report\nUs secretary of state Mike Pompeo is calling illegal migration crisis but according to Elizabeth ... associate professor of Latin American studies at the University of Arizona the number of migrants crossing the U.S southern border it's at a forty year low\nIt hasn't been this low since the Nineteen seventies ... even though we see these caravans that a visible and seemed to indicate an increase in migration overall that's not really the case\n... says that as border restrictions have tightened the attorney has become more expensive and dangerous increasing the incidence of extortion and trafficking of women and children as a result migrants band together and large caravans for protection along immigration roots Shannon

sewer systems mark Bowe and his chief of emergency services for hard hit ... county\nThat the Trump tax code actually means a tax increase for most people's state income tax\nAnd in fact will be bringing in almost nine hundred million dollars more a year according to the state government and you think that should be tapped for roads I've had some of it should be when you see how much we starve roads over the last Twenty years we need to re priority when when\nI look at both prop one oh nine and one ten another difference I see is just the amount of money that would be generated a what do you say John Caldera to those who complained that that one oh nine is just a drop in the bucket\nIt's not a drop in the bucket it is a serious amount of money to jumpstart the most critical projects and they'd be really clear and concede this is not a silver bullet\nOr nor is it a a unicorn bullets are like twenty or one ten unicorn bullet I always have never heard of that I remember when I was gonna say Christmas tree was\nIt is a doable amount my sense is that people are not ready for a state wide tax increase they're usually not they usually go down very strongly so what is it that we can get done immediately and that's where one oh nine is all\nRight and on one ten Kelly ... to this idea of the sales tax increase you are hearing from mayor is like the mayor in Colorado Springs he says listen we've already passed some local taxes to address our own local transportation needs\nAlong comes to the states perhaps with its own tax increase and the burden is just going up to high end our specific community would you address that concern for us\nYeah you have two huge issues first rural Colorado local communities there are not going to be able to on their own solve their transportation needs the and why would we in the metro area care about that is because we have a workforce who cares about getting around the state it's part of the quality of life we sell here\nAnd if you're going to fix the system you have to fix it not city by city and hope everybody comes up with their contribution but you have to fix both the state system\nAnd the local system do you have any concerns that the tax rate is getting too high and some Colorado communities so our tax rate when you combined those state and local is still very competitive or in the country\nUm and so we don't have concerns about it are greater concern is our failure to invest\nIs impacting us greatly a study was done Ryan that shows each of us today is pain over two thousand dollars a year in use using more gas because we're sitting in traffic damage to our vehicles because of the condition of our roads more accidents\nTwo thousand dollars a year you talked about impacting working families this small increase in sales tax will help reduce that cost junk out there are there's\nNursing personally so that at a Twenty one percent jump in our state sales tax is a small amount it is a serious investment\nI I I haven't done the math on the fly is that right twenty hour and that\nIs wrong what you're paying sales tax this'll be roughly about seven or eight percent what you paying sales tax total heart\nCurrent sales tax is two point five percent on the state level besides another point six to that as an increase of Twenty one percent\nIn any way you cut it it means that places like Boulder and Longmont and superior will be paying nine percent\nOf the same thing down in Colorado Springs which is why mayor is like the one in Jamestown and all over say wait a second this could hurt our ability\nLocally if we want to raise more taxes for local mobility local projects for seniors local safety projects\nAnd by the way let me I I Want to consider a couple of things we both agree not enough money is going into into transferred yes that's right and I also agree or something that Kelly said often is that there's a problem with our way we tax what we do right now we do mostly on a gas tax\nAnd uh as our cars become more efficient that means we're not getting as much back where ...\nYears since the gas tax free ...\nLet me just say that you're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan water and it's part of our mid term election coverage we are debating a politely discussing\nPropositions one oh nine and one ten on your ballot they both have to do with transportation they take different approaches and junk how they're all note that one oh nine fix our damn roads really does not make any funds available for alternative transportation that's a key difference here why why\nWell when you take a look at how much the state has been putting into trends that it's not as though a transit systems are starving for money or last year or two these appropriation was about to point two billion dollars and they carry only a fraction of our country it's about three or four percent\nWhereas she got a whopping one point four billion in other words ... almost half in other words we're spending a lot of money on transit as it is our roads are in trouble\nAnd we need we're at a crisis and we need to start investing in these problems otherwise we're going to have safety issues and people could lose their lives if we don't make roads safer in a realistic way\nOK you are basing fix our damn roads in part on the economic bounty that Colorado is experiencing I Want to play the view of the current governor [noise] uh this is John Hickenlooper\nI asked him about prop one oh nine\nFix our down roads would want to bond bitchy borrow three point five billion dollars and the state would have to pay that back every year with no new resources and I think that's crazy that the people proposing this are not willing to say where they're going to make these cuts how many people going to lose healthcare coverage I'm not sure we got pulled back for education funding\nAll right so as he tells it other things will suffer if one oh nine goes forward addressed that\nI've seen these scare tactics before but we've done this before with a T rex plan and in fact with the help of the Denver chamber back when we didn't have these massive surpluses pouring into the state I understand there is sort of bell\nWeather or or good weather predicted like what happens if you have hung up\nBecause there there is a structural change the federal tax law which means of federal or a change to our tax taxes as well\nYou think the Trump tax cuts uh lend a certain stability\nTo the well what happens is the line item you take from your federal foreign to do your state income tax as that goes up dramatically if we wanted it to be revenue neutral we'd have to lower the taxes but let me just say this other governors like Bill Owens partnered with the Denver chamber of commerce Twenty years ago to do something when we had even less money\nSo to say that even if times were awful\nThat we could not re prioritize less than one percent of our spending towards roads\nI don't know any household that couldn't be prioritized one percent of their budget\nOf course tax policy doesn't necessarily say the same that could change too if an administration\nWe have some changes in revenue and just went on to what if we wanted to ... we could pay this off in three years with the amount of surpluses we have so we have lots of choices\nI Want to say Kelly the governor Hickenlooper does back prop one tenth the tax increase but you're not getting rousing support from either of the two candidates running to replace him the major party candidates the Republican Walker Stapleton\nSides with junk Caldera in favor of the bond issue with out a tax increase and Democrat Jared polish isn't too hot on the idea the sales tax increase to to pay for this what\nDo I say to that yeah yeah the question is implied [laughter] so I think that we you know when you look at our coalition what you're going to see is a huge diverse coalition many of whom normally don't support tax increases\nAnd the chamber is not a huge fan of tax increases until you do the math and you realize the only way we're going to dress and improve our transportation systems so our lives are better is if we fund and one of the reason we like sales tax is the first Ninety two million dollars that's raised is paid by tourists people who visit our state\nAnd so that was one of the reasons the coalition supports a sales tax is the strategy [noise]\nSo I saw the results of a recent poll and I think that poets actually partly funded by the independence Institute and fix our damn roads but it does show\nThat people lean a towards one oh nine fix our damn roads of those who are decided there are many undecided we should say on this topic\nCan we talk through just briefly like I'm ... ... voter confusion or perhaps even voter generosity like the idea that one of these might pass both of these might pass neither of these might pass I mean in many ways you have ... measures here John\nI think it's more likely that neither would pass than both would pass it both were passed than terrific we've got lots of funding for lots of things\nI have a feeling one or the other will pass and giving a history of tax increases state wide and polling not only from I'm not away from\nThat we've done but also polling that groups like the ... done with parents group we've seen that this was not a very popular proposal but we'll find out on election day and we can vote either way I'll give you the last word\nCan we ... we have done a lot of pulling in research on our initiative prop one ten is built around what voters value local control money coming into their communities in identified list of priorities Twenty years it goes away the biggest projects that improve the quality of life and voters have consistently told us they like this and supported\nThanks for being with us both of you thank you Kelly rough president of the Denver metro chamber of commerce she had the coalition in favor of prop one ten to raise the state's sales tax for transportation John Caldera heads the libertarian independence Institute\nHe supports proposition one oh nine otherwise known as fix our damn roads it would raise three and a half billion dollars in bonds and repay them with existing state funds\nIt's Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar they often looked like bird houses but they're filled with books there are more than five hundred little free libraries in neighborhoods throughout Denver alone\nThe idea for them came from Todd bowl who passed away Thursday at the age of sixty two he had pancreatic cancer\nLet's listen back to my conversation with both from last year he was in Denver to declare it a city of distinction welcome to the program hello thank you very much how did the idea of little free libraries come to you\nIt ... it was just a a when my mother passed you know I I couldn't I couldn't pray enough when she was dying and couldn't cry enough can scream enough and so\nAt her funeral I gave away a little necklaces to June a bullet dancing spirit Nineteen twenty seventh through\nAnd it was based on an old Sioux Indian saying that nobody really ever passes into all they've touched are gone and so what it was it was a dance of my mother to the community so I put up this a little schoolhouse one room schoolhouse that a\nA kind of mimic to where she taught as a as a teacher that she was a teacher yeah and then I put in books that she'd that you'd had over the years that she passed back and forth with family and I felt it was kind of a gift to the community to celebrate that spirit of who my mother was ...\nSo in some ways do you see each little free library has a version of your mother\nContinuing dancing dancing absolutely um ice each the library's like one of my kids\nAnd I see each one of them is a dance of my mother around the planet you call people who put up a little free libraries stewards and are there more than five hundred of them in metro Denver I guess making it one of the most active regions in the country absolutely Denver has been absolutely wonderful ah they embrace it as art they've in braces community\nThey've been raised to as a ways of giving back to the community social justice they've done all kinds of things and I've watched him for years\nAnd we've been absolutely impressed what happens and we know that the five hundred you have today in a couple of years will be a thousand so we we feel that it's becoming a part of the fabric of Denver and that is really exciting to us a thought\nCrossed my mind is I was walking through the neighborhood that the people who live there likely had no problem accessing books you know there's the public library\nAh where I was walking they were probably well heeled enough to buy a book if they needed one like what what role do these play what do you see is the the mission of little free libraries\nWill uh I Believe one that everybody has a right to read and then everybody should read and our long term goal isn't twenty thirty five that we write a book is titled we all read weld together the history of the grassroots literacy movement\nAnd what we do is write a chapter every year in Denver is a big part of that chapter in the idea is that we don't have enough resources really to you know make the difference we need to make totally so neighborhoods step up and help educate and help with literacy of their own community\nAnd do you find that these little free libraries appear in all kinds of neighborhoods are in more upper middle class ones like what what do you know as you look\nAt their distribution I'm living free libraries about eighty five percent when women mothers are the key drivers of little free library\nAnd what happens is they listen to it on a public radio station like this or read it in the newspaper in upper class higher social economic neighborhoods start and then what happens is it starts to work its way through the community starts in ending up at the apartment to trailer home you know the schools\nAnd so what happens is starts out more social economic higher levels and then it works its way throughout the community to all levels than you've seen that in communities around the world I guess Detroit Cleveland Minneapolis St Paul Los Angeles\nEl Paso Phoenix New Orleans on and on is it data driven like are you looking at ways in which that I can tell you about where they are and where they need to be well we have a world map and the world map is somebody uh signs up with us it's a sign that are specific number\nAnd they go up on the world map and when we know are they are and then you can look at the world map anywhere you are going or traveling and go visit a little free library\nWe know that they need to be really everywhere and we find out at higher social economic neighborhoods is more about building community and connecting community and the lower social economic neighborhoods us more about literacy in building the reading\nUm I opened one little free library and there is quite the hodgepodge a biography of late jazz singer Betty Carter and adventurers guide to Hawaii there was a children's picture book\nDo these though in some way become our final resting place for books that people want to get rid of what\nHappens is people often and their book lovers and book lovers tell us all the time that books are my heart and soul they do find my humanity to find who am I Can't live without books and they tell us all the time this is a natural extension of who they are\nAnd so the little free library becomes really a part of them be start out by doing just what you said is arresting ground for that something they want to get rid of the ... and it turns into the most intimate experience in the community because what happens\nIs you're sharing of your heart and who you are and what happens is people start sharing their best and most important books to reflect themselves to the community and for those unfamiliar with what these look like um\nThey they are kind of schoolhouse like or bird house like that really everyone who\nIraq's one does it a little differently\nBut as soon as the Internet like wacky or designs you've seen boil everything from rocket ships to you know we see things that are out of old ... old microwaves we see 'em on microwave old microwaves old fridge raiders of computers you know people\nTurn almost anything they can imagine into a little free library\nWhat is your favorite story about someone encountering a little free library\nWill probably my favorite story was a I got approached by a ... the former governor Jim Doyle of Wisconsin He kept me on the shoulders he's where you're from right right ... and\nAnd he said you know tied you said I have to tell you my wife and I love little free libraries and he said and I want to tell you what's going on in America I said that's not who we are right now he says this is not we as Americans we're not this device if\nWe're not this polarized you said a little free libraries\nIs more about who we are he said we reach across the aisle we reach across the street we pick each other up we help each other we don't care where they're from we want to make their life better he said ... little free libraries more of a reflection of what Americans really are and so uh that touch me deeply in\nOne more is that a man came up to me and he said after presentation\nLittle free libraries I understand them it's like air conditioning and I said well you know what do you mean to how so yeah and he said well when he was a kid he's sixty something\nHe uh the parents and his grandparents read on the\nDeck earn their porch they played in the streets with the kids and the sidewalks and you know the fields and then they got air conditioning they went in the house just shut the windows\nThey shut the doors they turned on the TV and he said and it was all downhill from then on the digital divide began and he said but it's been over fifty years and with little free library\nWe're talking again they're they're connecting again with the neighborhood around them it does strike me as kind of beautifully analog you know little free libraries in the digital world and it's outside for that matter are you a steward that you have a little free librarian in front of your home town\nOf several I have is the first one you know he was the first one yet [laughter] is that that that would instill standing yet still standing and I also have the thousands one that I put to make that is on her and my dad when he passed in that one I have a music box you open it up and plays to dream the impossible dream which is kind of cool you're very poetic\nI think we're all passionate at heart and I think that all of us have that a passion inside that we just want to come out\nIn one of the things about them and free library just in the dance of the community and you find out how many people are really caring and really caring about their neighbors\nTodd Bowles speaking with us last year as he designated Denver a city of distinction for having more than five hundred little free libraries both died Thursday at age sixty two from complications due to ... cancer [noise]\nColorado matters from CPR news\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nUm [noise]", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018",
