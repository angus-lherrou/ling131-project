I mean there could be there a local regulation of that restrict that but um you know there would be minimal impact\nBecause now onto maybe some economic an analysis of this listener question\nHow old is your drawer deal and I'd like to see a comparison to that all the oil and gas industry to him to Colorado's overall economy is just charge compared to other industries\nSo one way to look at this is to examine what percentage the industry is of Colorado's overall gross domestic product so\nI'm I looked at a couple of different years twenty fourteen was kind of the peak of the oil and gas boom in Colorado in the industry accounted for about seven percent of the state's GDP than seven percent at the height they're less right\nTwenty sixteen with a low point for the industry was about three percent and twenty Eighteen I'm you know you see about five percent so when you look at the average over ten years for oil and gas extraction um you know it's really a doesn't really fit into the top ten industries for GDP which\nIs really led by things like real estate IT Services manufacturing healthcare\nOkay there comes a surprise to me what about jobs though does the raking change when you start to look at that point but associated with only\nAlso not really not seeing stuff on the top ten so state wide more than twenty nine twenty nine thousand people are directly employed by oil and gas companies that's about one percent of the state's overall workforce\nThe data though does not track support services connected to the industry so\nUm you know it's not capturing the number is maybe truck drivers who are driving water to oil and gas drilling sites you know what one thing I Will point out here though is that the impact of proposition one twelve if it's passed would really be acutely felt in a place like weld county 'cause that's where a lot of oil and gas workers live\nRight now okay so that impact might be uneven across the state and local launching traded in some communities here's another listener question on the numbers\nHi this is any race from Lewis fell I Wonder how much or what percentage of the state's overall budget comes from taxes on oil and gas\nSo statewide taxes are those are something called a severance tax that the oil and gas industry ... pays 'em you know look at between about twenty twelve twenty Seventeen the range was pretty wide between four million dollars and two hundred and sixty five million dollars\nUm that's less it sounds like a lot it's less than one percent of the state budget a and actually the the amount of severance tax that's paid is very small when you compare Colorado to say Alaska where several taxes make up more than fifty percent of you know the coffers there\nI'm surprised by the range of severance tax is from year to year I guess that shows just how much the industry is prone to booms and busts\nAnd it's all based off of the price of oil as you may imagine you know one thing I really also want to point out is that um oil and gas companies also pay property taxes local governments so weld county is bringing tens of millions of dollars in property taxes that are based off of wealth and that's been a significant support they're\nSpeaking again to this idea that some places might be more disproportionally affected than others if prop one twelve war to pass Grace Hood when you've been talking with voters have you gotten any sense of from them that they might vote for this proposition because of concerns about climate change\nGreat question so I was out in Loveland and was canvassing for several hours mirroring uh kinda shadowing the Colorado rising group was inspired mental group that's been supportive as you are following the canvasser I was following the canvassers and I have to say I mean I did not hear a single voter bring that up as a priority\nI understand that some environmental advocates are really bringing that up as a point but my sense is it's sort of more of an intellectual point for ah groups then something that might be top of mind for the majority of voters\nOkay on a similar seem so advocates are touting cleaner air safer conditions in general what truth is there to those claims\nSo I I think it's really important to point out just sort of laid the groundwork here um proposition one twelve does not impact the forty three thousand active wells in Colorado who was already there which was already there which state it would only impact how future permits and new wells\nAre approved across the state and one thing we're that's worth pointing out so Colorado does have some of the strictest methane ... ah restrictions and monitoring requirements in the country\nUm but there are other air pollutants let's say benzene that could escape from oil and gas equipment and I don't think that you know ... to have a dramatic effect in decreasing some of those other um air pollutants because there's all these tens of thousands of wells that are already in operation\nSo you know one a area where I think potentially stronger argument could be made is that they're explosions that can happen around oil and gas wells so they are rare but several of happened in recent years one last year resulted in the work or death and Firestone we saw to residents who died after\nThis well leapt raw uncensored natural gas in the soil\nSo I think that placing future restrictions on wealth twenty five hundred feet from from homes that would presumably make things safer\nI appreciate this thank you so much rent history in these questions he pure energy reporter Grace Hood answering questions about ... one twelve and we should say that\nThis proposition is not in a vacuum the oil and gas industry is obviously concerned and has thrown its support and a lot of money into a constitutional amendment on the ballot and we'll have more on that Thursday [noise]\nIf the long ballot in Colorado has you stress this year maybe this will help [noise]\nHi I'm In actual doctor from the people that brought me I don't hang comes prescription strength voter are known in its generic format\nVoting learning it sounds really painful and can I say

sometime today a crate is scheduled to leave the Denver Zoo carrying a big lump of fluffy white cargo\nAt least everything's fluffy except for the clause cranberry a seven hundred pound polar bear will head for zoo in Alaska where the plan is for her to settle in and just maybe by this time next year become among\nThe move is something of a divorce for cranberry and her current may lead who will leave Denver soon for Ohio it will be the first time in about eighty years Denver's had no polar bears [noise]\nBefore their departure we stopped by the polar bear habitat notices cranberry perched on that wrong\nAbsolutely that's a cranberry are female and she is about to turn Eighteen years old and she has some of it looks like pumpkin guts that she is interested in their\nSeasonally appropriate food I I just get the Vegas fence that she's posing for [noise]\nYou might be right you know the special person when she sees\nI see that is animal curator Becca McCluskey no cranberry and Lee yeah we're supposed to have something of a love affair\nThat didn't exactly pan out not so much we gave them seven tries we gave them seven breeding seasons and you know ... to date so I'm not so successful\nAnd so they're aware of the fact that in some instances it might be the best case where there and play to work for them for three or four or five years and then move on but stay happy customers and help enhance the company's brand overtime\nAnd that in turn has all kinds of ramifications for recruitment and retention in the long run beyond any individual employee supposed okay so you've signed up companies like tripled leg lift Disney or you also have Walmart the dial is company ... Vita healthcare corporation of America [noise]\nAh what exactly is it that you provide because it it strikes me that any company could just go to a college or university and say let's strike a deal you're a middle woman here\nIs good and you know a bit of what we do is akin to a health care benefits if you think of the way Kaiser works know geysers integrated model that manages the whole health insurance for a company like ours we use Kaiser but they also connect us to a network of doctors\nGuild does the same thing for a company so we administer all of the complexities of offering an education benefit and there are a lot of a tax components to this to make sure that it's tax efficient for the companies\nAnd a lot of details that have to you managed to help the student ideally be debt free when they graduate and we managed that\nAnd then we also connect the schools\nA network of universities to the employer and and as you said yes a company could go strike a deal with one school and you see that happen sometimes but managing dozens or hundreds of those relationships tend not to be the core competency what of a corporate ... charging\n... ... not necessarily connecting with institutions of higher education no you are conducting a companies with bricks and mortar a higher ed but also online higher ed what exactly are the workers getting out of this\nI'm Joe you know talk about that in the tangible and then the intangibles what they're getting is a tends to be either up Ninety two hundred percent of their tuition paid for my goodness at a number of schools within our network of schools\nAnd that also includes coaching and advising which we provide so what we found is that many low and middle wage workers who haven't gone to college before often their parents didn't go to college there first and their family maybe they don't have a lot of friends who have\nAnd they really need support navigating the whole process so we have a team of coaches and advisors who help every student figure out where do I want to go to school what program is aligned with the things I'm excited about it in my career and moving either up within my company or beyond\nAnd then a coach to work with you throughout your whole degree program to help you figure out how to succeed in college\nIs this very expensive for companies like what is the cost benefit analysis the executives have to do before the sort of jump into higher at as a benefit for their employees\nSo fortunate to our lives pretty fantastic so most of our company see a return on investment around a hundred and thirty percent to two hundred and ten percent\nMeaning for every dollar they invest here they see a dollar thirty to two dollars ten come back into their corporate pockets how in the form of recruitment ad benefits is a lot of our company see their um job application rates go up by twenty to thirty percent when they announced a program like this\nBecause of program like this is a magnet that's borne out\nYet and then the short term retention benefits so right now a lot of the companies we work with the six to twelve months typical turnover meaning the employees only there for six to twelve month is with us and this can extend it to three or four years so when you can hire one great employee once for four years versus hire eight employees over that four year span you read a lot of savings\nSeem more about the kind of worker who takes advantage of this benefit\nSure so they tend to be high potential employees um typically only three to five percent of an employee base will use a benefit like this in any given year so it's not mass um but it's the employees who I've been wanting to go to college but haven't been able to figure out how to navigate it either the cost\nThat time management or the things that have held them back from going back to school prior\nUse it but they don't have their undergrad degrees at all mostly\nTypically yeah so we are mission that guilt is to work with the sixty four million Americans who haven't yet had a chance to either earn a bachelor's degree or a meaningful higher ed credential\nNow what is in it for the colleges and universities because they have to be at the table for this deal right\nSo um you know of the American workforce there's about a hundred and sixty million Americans who work sixty four million of them haven't completed college and about thirty million of them work at the fortune one thousand and so we're helping connect universities who want to meet those thirty million of its about half of their address Abul population\nSit in the fortune without that until we help the university's meet them and and what that does is dramatically reduce the university's marketing costs and\nAnd this isn't well known but marketing and advertising costs or the the big capital of higher ed right now the for profit schools the University of Phoenix says they spend four to six thousand dollars to acquire a student and the nonprofit schools we work with can't afford that\nAnd so what we do is we prevent them from having to spend four to six thousand dollars on Google and Facebook ads to find a student and instead meat that student directly through their company\nAnd these are students that otherwise wouldn't necessarily be within their reach and vice versa not necessarily potential students who would've known themselves to reach out to a college or university is that\nOkay I'm I'm fascinated by this how the heck do you make money that's always a question induced ruptures is you know when entrepreneur is\nFind some niche\nHow does it keep you afloat\nGreat question so we captured the savings that the universities would have otherwise spent on Google and Facebook ads they passed some of that marketing and advertising savings on together to cover all the services we offered that there are also she is counting wishing right you are but yep yep\nSo they're both paying you and they're discounting tuition and it still you say is a benefit to the institutions of higher education\nAnd not to because of the the crazy marketing and advertising market of higher ed today Google number one Byron twenty fourteen with higher education\nReally mhm I also think that a lot of people are an easy with the idea of nonprofit institutions and you work with him exclusively spending a lot of money on advertising you know\nYeah it's somewhat sideways but it's a hard ... it's a hard thing to figure out because how should they attract students and otherwise the for profit schools are the only ones that low income Americans have ever heard of do\nYou think we will see more companies offering higher education as a benefit\nYeah we see it as a growing trend and at the last year has only reinforced that pretty dramatically\nJust briefly I Want to know that you started this company guild education in San Francisco and then moved to Denver and just a few seconds what prompted you to move\nA couple of things talent market culture because we're ... and we wanted a double bottom line and I grew up there\nAnd you grow up here and cost maybe a little bit yeah yeah although the divide between San Francisco in Denver is less than it used to be eight right Rachel thanks for being with us fascinating stuff thank you Rachel Carlson his CEO of Denver bay skilled education her company helps
