Wisconsin's a much larger states in Madison and got\nWe've got a lot of activists talking points to there there's a lot of reasons to\nBe critical of of Scott Walker and think that he's in trouble but but you don't know a lot of this is ... is the sort of the you know if you feel it feels like the other part is in the wheel on education I think that we're having a very constructive debate about education here in Wisconsin I think it's great pointed out before\nA Scott Walker recognize you got a problem with that and these pumped a lot of money now back into education\nAt the schools are not falling apart um the the graduation rate has not collapse the grades of not collapse\nOr university system is still one of the prides of of the country\nSo there is always a ... you know in an attempt to and there's a tendency to make things very apocalyptic but right now and this is the irony of politics nationally the economy is really quite strong in Wisconsin the unemployment rate is low taxes have been held low\nA despite the talking points that's a ... not falling apart I drive with them all the time and the only time I see that the roads are falling apart is when they see a TV ad\nUm which is not to say that uh there was not a way for for change and an exhaustion going on here but what you just heard is understand that the Wisconsin is you know there there is there is this a rural Wisconsin perspective that I think would be very very different\nThan the perspective of partisan Democrats calling in from Madison\n... yeah that's all true I mean one of the interesting things about Wisconsin and have Sweeney the rural voters and again we saw that between the Obama and Trump elections and these people as one of your previous guest said\nThere's no universal theory you explain you know why they voted for Trump after voting for Obama I mean a lot of it with anti Hillary some of his economic some of it was just they have a history of swinging against the party in power and that's again one of the problems to come back to Scott Walker he hasn't been one is to regularly scheduled elections\nUnder a Democratic president where Republican voters are mobilized and now he's running under the under ... run by president and that's the last time there was a Republican president the Democrats that are really good mid term it was down\n... just a yes or no Charlie does Governor Walker win reelection\nI'm asked me twenty four hours from now we have a market university ... coming out of the mid middle drag the middle of not having to go there and I'm going to say that I think when you get out because he has he has a track record has been pretty strong\nAre right it's it's certainly sign like Greg thank you very much for being on America on the line tonight joined us again tomorrow night and remember you can tweet us at has had a ... or limit the comments on our show page at WNYC dot org we'll see you tomorrow\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support is provided by the any Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee documentary might\n\nListening to end up news from Colorado Public radio one Ninety point one F.

Elliott reports it's on the path to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle tomorrow as a major hurricane\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says the biggest threat from hurricane Michael is this storm surge that's predicted to be eight to twelve feet high along the wide stretch of Florida's coast east of the storm's path\nThink about this way the storm hits near Panama City the tap area was still see it a life threatening storm surge you cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation has ordered\nCoastal evacuations are under way from the Alabama Florida State line to Florida is Big Bend area National Guard troops have been deployed to help with the response and the coast guard has closed all of the port in the path of hurricane Michael Debbie Elliott NPR News forecasters\nAt the national Hurricane Center in Miami expect Michael to be near category for strength when it makes landfall latest word from the hurricane center puts the storm about two hundred miles south southwest of Appalachia cola Florida\nIs currently packing top winds of one hundred twenty five miles per hour President Trump has declared an emergency for the entire state\nA surprise announcement from the White House today about the United nations ambassador Nikki Haley she's planning to resign NPR's Scott Horsley reports of Haley relief or opposed as one of the nation's top diplomat at the end of the year\nHaley offered no explanation for the timing of her departure which caught many observers off guard the former South Carolina Governor suggested she simply worn out by the often combative diplomacy at the un joking that she wears body armor on the job President Trump praised Haley as an effective advocate for his America First agenda\nWe've just had a lot of writers said so many other friends who also and I think the world is Nikki said the world is really respecting the United states again much more so they have and then they have in many many decades\nIn fact international surveys but if you Research Center showed that attitudes towards the U.S and its president is sharply declined and most countries since Trump took office Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo was praising ambassador Haley\nHad been a great partner mine for them now five months that she and I had been working together a head I want to wish her very well whatever comes next\nBecause so much of being in a gang is about face and it's about fronting\nIt matters a great deal if someone say finds your Facebook it to counter trolls you or a leaves a disrespectful Instagram comment\nAnd something else that's happened as this game violence moves the social media is that it also means that violence is no longer about who's feuding for a particular block but games at the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you're going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people ... yelled words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted online\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception and it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just a eighty percent of fights in school sparked from something on line but also of course the spate of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting in a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beeps at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world\nWill make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\nYou have an interesting kind of look at ... at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and that it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and\nThere are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring at the time a lot of people talking about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone\nThe trouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media\nSources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kid Facebook but then authoritarians figure it out they figure how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth\nAnd so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media and a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking of what they're saying\nAh for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use as a journalist and turkey who retweet something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands of an a Turkish prison so governments can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China's presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say\nTo a what you buy can all be monitored and it's brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness so for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent\nIf you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a\nFree charges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles so it affects uh how attractive the person you're gonna be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd I what's notable about this what goes in a way that or will never could have imagined\nIs the network side of your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network does so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction it's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but the the government will force you to\nOf this kind of Internet presence or for example there are certain places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the apps that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell by China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs and a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict and social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air [noise]\n\n\n\nThank you to leadership partners the junk neck our charitable find significant investors in our community through their gift to CPR learned more about leadership partners on the individual getting page at CPR data work\n\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThen Hamas would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set of model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nYes one of the challenges of space is that\nUh we don't have a good handle on the lingo so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they are not so at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg\nWho's acting like they are an American veteran grandmother from Texas but then you have\nAlso bought these are machines user algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box contrived that message viral by having thousands or tens of thousands of voices echo at out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now\nSomething that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing is creating accounts and having them lie dormant and have a history of messages that seem authentic\nAnd benign and not related to hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road it'll be much harder to detect that as something other than a real person\nYou said an amazing number here you said when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know that is\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is it out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts\nThese were in essence fake followers created to give the symbol end of a massive on line following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral\nRight but the fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically uh bought account generated out of water known as click farms are these are almost you think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh\nAnd then you combine these uh physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power in politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big in number but an extent that campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nAre now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but they haven't most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to a there is actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing the echo effect into the broader population including the media itself one of the uh accounts that was\nPosing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it\nAnd so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether at swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken
