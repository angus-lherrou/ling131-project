Colorado they knew about the ... so they would only go growth for the people who knew it had never had any ambition of trying to grow for market outside of southern Colorado\nNow and in a part of it was just the meat I sold itself it was bread it was a very delicate fragile chili that you had a scientist with a Colorado State named Michael bart solo about how a ... twenty five years ago we started trying to breed a better Chile or improve that that\nThat's that's what they that's a term in horticulture and then about ten years ago he debuted and improved a meta so Chile called the Moscow chili named after or a uncle of aids who grew these chilies for a long time ago for a long time so again we only have really a decade ago when the\nUh and the economy's might in fact ... say just a bit more what you mean when you say this can be profitable\n[noise]\nXcel Energy recently lost by about a year ago put out on all sources solicitation for who could supply them electricity at what price from any source\nThey got no bid for fossil sources of new power less than four cents a kilowatt hour when I was a little on a little under two cents solar was a little over two cents whim plus solar plus storage batteries was three cents\nActually let assume that natural gas would be the winner\nOur governor has been positioning the state to be a natural gas state\nThey were gobs smacked\nRenewable energy is cheaper than fossil energy and so when citizens put solar on their homes their electricity bills go down I have a solar on my ranch in twenty Thirteen when the floods happened in power was out for the better part of a week\nNot at my house I called my neighbors said you want to come charge your cell phones are\nPut stuff in the freezer\nIt is more secure\nIt builds community and there are now more jobs in Colorado from renewable energy clean energy energy efficiency than from all of the extractive industries oil gas coal uranium those jobs are declining\nFracking the uh people are saying oh don't vote for a proposition on twelve it'll cut jobs those jobs are dying anyway that industry is badly in debt over leverage and we'll go away\nWhy I Wonder how ...\nWe should be investing in what will solve climate change and again it's cheaper once you put up the wind and solar it's free the fuel is free what part of free don't you understand\nYou say it's cheaper how much of that is because of subsidies\nAll in all energy is subsidized globally we spend five trillion dollars actually I Believe it's five point three\nEvery year subsidizing fossil energy that's ten billion dollars in it and that comes out of your in my tax dollars for citizens around the world all of the renewable subsidies put together are far less than what we continue to subsidize to fossil energy\nSo I'm a free marketeers let's get rid of all subsidies\nLet all these technologies compete on their merits and you will not hear the oil and gas boys saying that because they cannot exist without those subsidies\nHunter lemons of the Colorado carbon fund and natural capital solutions what is carbon farming help us understand that as a potential way of uh I guess it sequestering carbon\n[noise] it is when you farm or ranch regenerative lovely using what's called holistic management you're taking carbon out of the air and putting it back in the soil one of the best examples and if you want a good video on this\nGabe brown keys to building a healthy soil\nGables up north Dakota corn and soybean farmer struggling because he was struggling he went first to know till he stopped breaking the soil guy who break the soil turned it upside down\nThe carbon escapes he then went to planting cover crops and many of them deep rooted\nThat takes carbon deep into the soil he them introduced animals cattle goats sheep pigs the animal impact the disturbance on the ground for a short period of time to eat everything and then you move them to a new pasture using electric fence was\nThat action is what put the ten feet of thick black soil that the pioneers found when they came across the great plains it put that black which is carbon deep into the soil\nDid has gone on some of his tactics from a little over one percent soil organic matter carbon to now on some of them over eleven percent\nNative prairie soil is seven percent Gabe is rolling climate change backward and he's gone from a struggling commodity operation to now a very profitable\nFarming ranching operation selling a variety of crops products this is being done in color\nAuto right in Boulder is the savory Institute which is the center of how you do regenerative agriculture regenerative grazing you can go on a savory Institute website and find we use of evidence all the scientific studies showing that we can roll climate change backward\nIs that literally taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the ground helped I realize that's probably a naive question but help help listeners understand just briefly this the science of that or is it simply that you are not releasing carbon that would otherwise be released\nNo it says you set it to begin with you are taking carbon out of the air it's called photosynthesis so grass has fourteen times the carbon per weight of the tree\nThe world's grasslands are the world's second largest carbon sink carbon still go on storage after the oceans and yet we in the ... the grassland we can re carbon eyes them by grazing the way that grasslands co evolved with grazing animals\nOn the great plains the words of advice and or dance packed because there were wolves if a wolf wants to eat you the safe place to be using the middle of the herd so they're all trying to get to the middle there pumped up they eat everything and then they move on\nMeanwhile they fertilize the ground there hubs of chop it up they don't come back until the grass has read grown\nBut that action of fertilizing it of impacting the grass drives carbon deep into the biological community and the soil particularly the Michael rise or fun guy and I know this is sounding a bit ...\nWell no it again and they\nGo to the gate brown video and gave walks through exactly what he did\nAnd why it's making him now wildly profitable\nThere are thousands of\nRegenerative farmers all over the United states now around the world savory Institute has regenerative hubs I Am a light now at the alliance center in Denver working with a team of people that are building a regenerative economic hub for the Denver Boulder area and you can\nGo on a natural capitalism website that kept solutions dot org and get information on what we're doing if you want to get involved and I just want to say Colorado\nEconomy and shifted from degenerative extractive to regenerative on economy in service to life\nI'll just leave listeners with the quotes from a new book you have called the finer future\nQuote some people look at the scary statistics coming at us and say there's nothing I can do about it I'll just partying until it's over this is perhaps the most profoundly irresponsible thing you can do you are the result of four
