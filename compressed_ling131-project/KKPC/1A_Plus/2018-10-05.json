O. M. I. T. Y. between the sites that an election is coming up that could change things instead we go into full throttle Russian mode\nAnd free democratic presidents especially Clinton and Obama\nConstitutional law professors were late getting started nominating people they took their own sweet time while they hadn't majorities and then were found themselves incredibly blocked by Mitch McConnell's very strategic ways of doing things now McConnell has the whip hand\nAnd is using it very strongly and Democrats will come back inevitably with a within their hands and as you said this has parallels to the middle east ...\nUh deep and profound issue for Republicans to change the kinds of people who were nominated as judges and as you point out it's not just the Supreme Court vitally important as that is it's lower courts as well and President Trump has\nMoved an awful lot of them over the last couple of years let me ask how much that matters um\nConservatives will save the conservative judges or just interpreting the law obviously they'll interpret differently than a liberal judge but there's still the law and especially in the higher courts judicial rulings our collective decisions of multiple people who serve an institution should we think that that much changes really on the way\nI think we probably could see a court this more conservative than any court in at least a sixty Seventy eighty years going back to the new deal\nI'm not sure of course and the Supreme Court has always in modern times anyway had the respect of the public much more than the other two branches of government\nI Would be very sorry if I ended up covering institution that was viewed as just political but we are in danger of people are going to their corners on the court and right now it's just the Senate and the basis but you don't want\nTo you know the the crown jewel of the American democracy as the late shift justice Rehnquist said is our independent judiciary and we don't want to lose that and the respect for that\nHasn't the chief justice that you've covered John Roberts spent years trying and various subtle ways to reinforce the seeming neutrality assuming into ...\nAnd a lot of people thought that his vote to uphold the um the ... act was in essence an effort not to inject the Supreme Court into the politics of the moment\nAnd essentially say the president wants to this so it's what I ought to go along\nWell not just the president that Congress passed it by shrill alone I like I should\nWith Nina thanks very much for your inside really appreciate it we've also been hearing from NPR\nOn Elving NPRs to medical mountain are we've heard from many other individuals Kelsey Snell Scott Detrow Brakkton Booker and others through the last couple of hours of special coverage let's just briefly review what has happened on the Senate floor today by a final vote of fifty\nOne to forty nine senators have decided to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh that is simply ending debate what next happens likely tomorrow is a vote to actually confirm Brett Kavanaugh and fifty votes would do the job fifty votes plus vice president Pence\nSo we can afford to lose only won a handful of votes not entirely\nCertain you can be sure that will continue covering this on NPR dot org at all things considered this afternoon and in a special report on your local member station this is NPR News\nThis is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

unbiased but documents tell a different story\nThey complained at one of the meetings that they held in July ... there were too many positive attitudes toward marijuana and that if they were to turn the tide they needed to provide the counter narrative\nBugs feet broke that story which caught senator Michael Bennet detention we'll speak with the reporter then radical savers put Seventy percent of what they burned into retirement so they can quit work early\nAnd we go backstage it red rocks to meet Boulder folk musician Gregory Allen icicle right before his big show every time we lock out there to bizarre inevitable experience [laughter] oh\nNOW News line from NPR News in Washington I'm Marie schemes on\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is now on track for a final Senate vote probably some time this weekend on this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nThe voices senator Shelley Moore Capito what the majority yes vote on the procedural question the Senate will now continue to a final confirmation decision within thirty hours\nNPR's Scott Detrow has more\nIt was a party line vote with two exceptions Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no in West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin voted yes\nSenators can still change their minds ahead of the final up or down vote in fact Maine Senator Susan Collins a Republican since Harry ... may not be final and she'll announce her ultimate decision later today in a speech on the Senate floor\nThe final vote will likely be a help Saturday but it could be pushed to Sunday if Collins is a no Montana Republican Steve Gaines won't be available to vote tomorrow because his daughter is getting married Danes has he won't skip the wedding for a vote Scott Detrow NPR News Washington\nNPR's Brakkton Booker is watching the scene outside the U.S Supreme Court across from the U.S Capitol Grounds\nThe crowds outside the U.S Supreme Court then after the Senate passed a procedural vote to move with a nominee Brett Kavanaugh the crowds were not as big as they were yesterday protesters here still held signs that read stop cabinet\nNPR's Brakkton Booker at the Supreme Court here in Washington that nation's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in almost fifty years in September according to a government jobs data released today but as NPR's John Ydstie reports job creation cool did that last month\nThe three point seven percent unemployment rate in September is the lowest since December of Nineteen sixty nine that was during the Vietnam War when many potential workers were out of the workforce fighting in Southeast Asia\nToday's labor market is tied for other reasons\nA very strong economy has boosted demand for workers and the retirement of the baby boom is slowing growth in the workforce employers added only a hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs in September and that's the smallest monthly gain any year\nYou mentioned Colorado as us attorney Bob Troyer and he did indeed announced that he'll take a look at commercial growers and vendors\nWho may be contributing to the marijuana black market or even though they're licensed under state law he says there are too many loopholes in state law what what do you make of the timing\nI find it a little unusual honestly the premise of his argument if the issue is that too much marijuana is getting out of the legal system into the illegal one abolishing the regulatory legal schemes only seems to exacerbate the problem\nIt is possible that he could see that Colorado now with legalization in place for many years has problems with its regulatory scheme and he does want to crack down\nUm it seems though that he might be able to achieve his ends if he is sincere about them by working with people in the state to make sure that those problems don't continue\nLet's step back here you've got the federal government's a forming this committee to look at marijuana and what what might their end goal be do you have any sense from the creation of this committee or any of its\nUh proceedings what ... what they want to achieve\n[noise] given the fact that they've asked for data with negative trends and they said they wanted to possibly present this information to the White House or to the president himself\nIt could be that they are in the early stages of an effort to run essentially a campaign against legalization to make people concerned about the harms of marijuana they said that they want the agencies to portray it and show how it is a national threat\nA security threat a health threat and they could use that to try ... efforts to legalize marijuana in other states\nWhen I followed up uh with the White House and asked if they were looking for any positive information about legalization who had started at a this committee or what is being done now and what's coming up uh they didn't answer those questions so it's very hard to assess what their next steps going to be\nDominic thanks so much for sharing your reporting with us\nRyan thank you for having me Dominic Holden of buzzfeed his report that the Trump Administration is running a marijuana committee prompted Colorado senator Michael Bennet to raise concerns it's misleading people about marijuana then it said it in a statement this week that he intends to hold the committee to its

Ryan ... here's a pretty picture you're in your thirties or forties you're worth a million dollars and you've just retired\nPerhaps that sounds like a dream or like winning the lottery not so people are doing this right now because of their own financial decision making they're sometimes called the radicals savers and they're\nThat's said once you can live off four percent of the money you have saved up in an average year you could stop where she'd so we figured out we spend about forty thousand dollars a year so once we had a million dollars we would have enough to leave\nWhat do you miss your old lifestyle though oh like what is the sacrifice yeah I don't think\nIt's a sacrifice you know a a frugal simple life is a happy life I thought I Would be unhappy when I moved away from the big house but it turns out that the community and the people around us or what\nMakes us happy is ah if I had to pick one thing it would be the camaraderie camaraderie with my co workers I enjoyed them and I enjoyed the core nature out of my work but I could still do that I can still write code and I still do that just on my own terms so\nThat's a key question whether or not you're going to like life in retirement I Wonder if that kept you up at night\nThey did that was the main reason I [laughter] I stayed at my work in another year after I get humiliated enough money and it was because I was so afraid of being poured\nIn looking back now two months later after I left my job I realize how silly there was I don't have a I probably have ... good years of of life left and maybe fifty years of life overall and I'm never going to be able to fit in everything I wanted to just not enough time\nTo can you have a wife and two daughter and I do and what has this meant for your family life and wonder also just how you're white felt about this journey you had to go on together\nYou suck all your second question first I'm so thankful that I have an understanding wife who trust me

E. R. T. H. yeah the kind of birth you'd be on the ship or a train birth it's a great word be hard to you\nYou're listening to Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar and we're backstage at red rocks guessing dressing room number street with Gregory Allen Isaac off the Boulder Kelly folk musician his new album is called the evening machines\nAnd he's taking a few minutes before a sold out show to talk to us we gotta talk about caves\nOne of the first singles from the new album the sound is lush as your sound often is it's huge and it strikes me Gregory as the kind of song if it's going to encourage people to sing with it\nMhm I I think there are a lot of background vocals there are any yet [noise]\n\n\nIt almost strikes me as like a a drinking beer halls so harkening back to a time when in union halls people would sing together\nDo you think that's that's right\nYeah I mean we recorded that there is like twenty people in our farm just sing in every word\nSorting a bizarre sing along you know like a like a\nLike an otherworldly sounds like pretty bizarre story line but yeah that kind of anti Semitic feeling what is the bizarre story line\nI for me that songs about that kind of love of silence you know I wrote that was a great friend of mine Ron Scott from Austin we've written a bunch of songs together he came up to visit me from Austin he's awesome bizarre character to\nYou know you'd wake me up in the morning great I found I think I like birds and a half pounds I'm In the field you know and the writing that down run and then I Would just follow him around the farm and just write down where they said and\nHad all these pieces of paper in front of us and we kind of reflects on the day\nHis friend was visiting from Saint Paul\nWe're driving or to the airport and the St Paul life got\n\nYou know I ... that you are able to write lines that are so short and so packed with emotion\nAnd in this song it's we're or inside or outside the\nShow a charge on a shot [noise]\nAnd I just thought that ... to the core of what it is to be vulnerable\nUh-huh I remember reading that one because I was outside my house and it was like a ... when I was a big\nBright moons we see like the entire guard and you've seen the cheap like in the background see their eyes all kind of lit up and I thought there's no hot you can't hide in this kind of like you know and like you could in at night it is pure say yeah piercing\nWas reading the liner notes and you give credit to someone for God noises oh yeah the heck are God well God noises\nYou know Jim effort in are you making records for a long time\nHe had a bunch of these old keyboard laying around and I was just like Jamie let's make some God Knows there's just so I don't know what I call it that but we just kinda coined it and he's like all the bad news on this you mix the gotten new ideas on that Jamie didn't work on this record but we kinda kept that language\nAnd see if the idea that these are the sounds that make it feel a serial\nThe theory oh you know it could be anything organic or analog sound that\nYou can maybe throw back in the end of the mix are really far away or maybe to do some distortion or delay that maybe you don't hear on the first lesson but it kind of makes you feel something\nThere's a lot of gotten with his own little just another one\nAnd\nDid you lord on a regular\nThen the uh\n\nA relationship to someone like on him\nUm but that's the least interesting story to me\nI don't really care about any of these songs with the stories are for me of any of them I just really an after making something that people can connect to\nIn their own lives you know make it there to make it part of their life you know they're ...\nThanks where people will\nAnalyze what a song means yeah sure I mean I think one of them is song meanings yeah do you ever look at what your fans are saying what your songs me\nAnd I haven't I don't know maybe I'll do that I don't know you don't have to get might be cool because I think that's the coolest thing about music I mean that's what I've been given to so many artists [noise] in my life that music is so personal to me now that I don't even feel like it's they're\nSo much you can set in stone you try and do you\nLive from\nNo danger [noise]\nThanks for making friends before they do know from break a leg thanks\nDang in [noise]\n[noise]\nThe new album from Boulder folk musician Gregory Ellen ... each evening machines we spoke before his big show last weekend at red rocks and while we were there I took some pictures of that tunnel sit artists cover it with their autograph the Grateful Dead Lauren Hill one republic [noise]\nSo now a fellow clay he uh didn't I'm nowhere he was going still um and at this point they miss their training so they went spent the night at Lowry airfield\nAnd they uh caught a plane to fly a destination unknown but the plane couldn't get over the Rockies so they made a U turn back flowery field back on the train still doesn't know where he's going\nA bench relief they pull into the train station in Grand junction\nAnd a lay he um says is this I stop and control says yes it's your stop [laughter] so grab your bags and uh take this envelope and find a hotel room open it up and you'll figure out what to do and basically I'll see you later and that's where they parted ways\nListening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we are talking about Grand Junction role and really the wider western slopes role in the\nDevelopment of a nuclear weapon during World War two and a ... as part of the Manhattan Project ... do we know whether material from Colorado's western slope was in the\nBombs dropped on Japan\n[noise] you know that's a great question and you know I've looked into it and it it becomes very hard to trace you know specific Adam a uranium from all the way from from the Colorado Plateau to to its final use\nAh from what I can tell it looks like the um most of the material coming from the Colorado Plateau particularly\nThat flowed through the Grand Junction facility\nWould have gone into a reactor fuel which are produced plutonium which was used 'em at the first uh detonation of an atomic device that um the trinity test site that's running Mexico as well as as one of the bombs dropped on Japan\nSo the Grand Junction work on the Manhattan Project ended after about three years\nMany of the buildings were later removed from the site and they're also had to be a pretty big environmental cleanup but one building left behind was a log cabin that had been lady's office mhm and the department of energy had decided to turn that cabin into sort of a mini museum I guess\nYes a sort of the cabinet is fascinating ah it was already there when a second lieutenant a lady who showed up in Grand junction and a\nLady set up his headquarters in downtown grand junction but this\nA cabin was the office for refinery that refined\nUranium I'm already there uh it had been used as an office for a gravel pit um and and some folks had lived in it\nUm and then after World War two a lazy actually returned to Grand Junction as the first Atomic Energy commission manager of the office and he moved into the cabin as as his office space\nAnd you want to do watch very briefly with that cabin\nWell what we're looking to do is um share the story of not only of lieutenant lady but really share the stories of the sites that um\nThat are supported this nation throughout the world war two and the Cold War um and so folks can learn about what happened there what's happening there currently\nThanks so much for sharing this fascinating history with us thanks it's been my pleasure Patrick ... is an analyst with the department of energy and he joined us to talk about the deal these efforts to preserve the history of Grand Junction role in nuclear warfare and the U.S [noise]\n\nFinally today some feedback on a story we aired about a girls' boarding school in rural Tanzania it was built by a Denver non profit to improve the female graduation rate of just four percent\nWe told the story through the eyes of an American volunteer who visited the school and met one of its top graduates\nYou ... as soon as I used to be an issue at ... at least ... ended up to the gills and that we mean that they should never give up one day later than they have to fend had in the ... election then change\nAfter hearing this story Nina chain of golden wrote in she's an emergency medicine physician and humanitarian worker she says while she appreciated learning about the school\nWhat struck me about this story was how the story was actually told\nThey remind me of um an age old story telling us that we really need to shift away from which is getting that focused on outsiders coming in from other countries to help or say or change populations aid\nJane Says these kinds of stories can portray people is helpless or unable to create their own
