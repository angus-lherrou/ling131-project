interviewed as part of the FBI's reopened background investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd Paris camera Keith reports Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell plans to move forward with a confirmation vote this week\nFBI investigators have spoken with mark judge the Kavanaugh friend from high school who Christine Blasey Ford said was in the room when she alleges Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her Leyland Kaiser who was friends with Ford in high school\nHas been interviewed as well and Deborah Ramirez who says cabinet exposed himself to her at a drunken party at Yale\nHas also spoken to the FBI\nA source familiar with the matter told NPR's Ryan Lucas that she gave investigators more than a dozen names of people she says where either I witnesses or who heard about it at the time ... strenuously denies all these allegations camera Keith NPR News\nSenator Bernie Sanders a longtime critic of Amazon over its pay practices is praising the company for announcing it will

vice president Dave Clark says he hopes others will follow their lead\nWe certainly hope that we're able to influence at Congress and to move forward with an increase in the federal minimum wage will throw hopeful other large employers to fall off and they create their minimum wages as well\nThey made the move because they think the national minimum wage of seven twenty five is too low and Clark says this increase will have a significant impact on Amazon employees and their families Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters\nIn Germany chancellor ongoing Merkel's government says agreed on the details of proposed new immigration law that's modeled on the Canadian system\nAs may Nicholson reports the law intends to make it easier for skilled workers to get visas while preventing immigration for those who are unskilled\nThe proposed legislation removes had all the highly qualified known emu citizens with\nAnd I just didn't get a sense that there was a ton of excitement about either politician but even you remember ... the Democratic official at the amount of painting in his office this is what he said\nI think it's it's up for grabs I really do and his paws and Mr Stapleton need to spend some time down here they better pay attention to us\nSo have polish and Stapleton been campaigning in southern Colorado\nYeah they had the means at ... attended are held forty events according to his spokesperson and Stapleton has been down there it quote unquote dozens of times but they counted has yours is Colorado treasure\nBut also I should note that the the day I called about this the hour I called about this Stapleton was delivering a speech in ... and then moving on to the family salad\nSo according to the campaigns that candidates are there but so far it doesn't sound like their message that's connected with the voters in southern Colorado in a way where they feel like they're listening to kill\nOkay but let's look at this from campaigns perspective because I did some math\nAnd eighty percent of active voters in Colorado live along the northern front range so in places like Denver Fort Collins Colorado Springs in the suburbs around all those places have why should people in these places be concerned that\nVoters and more rural parts of Colorado like southern Colorado don't feel listen to you don't feel like their priorities are being represented [noise]\nThen why can't you just let other parts of the say be happy to\nThat's now if you're going to make the point I'm trying to make is that [laughter] that in a democracy you know you want the majority of people to have a say and if the majority of people have to be urban voters\nThen I'm not sure we should be protecting the voices of rural voters at the cost of urban and suburban [noise]\nThe first thing that comes to mind is like it's okay to one good things for other people's\nMy second argument would be a you know people moved to Denver and to Fort Collins or in Boulder\nAnd they don't other places right like Colorado is a beautiful state and we and you don't live in a city just to stay in cities live here because of its proximity to everything else the veil to crested Butte and to southern Colorado like there's some really cool things down there\nSo I don't know and do you live in the same neighborhood as Walker Stapleton or ...\nNo I'm not going to say where I live for the purpose of this I guess I don't think I live near either\nOkay so I think when someone who lives in Boulder lives in Denver suburb cares about ... or cares about Grand Junction\nUm or cares about northern Colorado it sends a message to the rest of the state that they care about them too and the other thing I Would say is I'm a justice your partner and I cover a lot of rural jails and I've been in a lot of raw sales and I will say that the opioid crisis in San Luis valley\nAnd the overcrowding you know if one part of the state it's economically suffering we all pay for that\nThey're not you know freshmen philosophy I hear that's okay that's allowed for the show okay great so so er it is but uh let's think about utilitarian as I'm right and that this is the idea\nIn philosophy that a moral decision is one that does the greatest good for the greatest number of people right right so if you're a governor that means your decisions would be for the you know the people along the front range where most people there\nThere's another part of utilitarian as which is these decisions are hurt or moral and good if they if they last through the long run\nI Would argue that over the long term\nColorado it'd be better off if if it's candidates for governor really did it and to everyone everyone\nFe New Alison thanks for coming in the doctor's amp\nThis episode of purple lush connects with a newsroom white project from CPR called road trip\nTo November Allison in nature and many other reporters here have traveled the state to learn what people are concerned about ahead of the ...\nLeading up to election day they're going to share what they heard today I'm joined by Alison as well as John Daley an entry Dukakis to talk about the governor's race in particular\nAnd a welcome to all of you nice to see when they do have to enter a you were in another part of southern Colorado driving highway fifty from the San Luis valley to Durango rough gig\nEither strongly backing Walker Stapleton or German polish or hadn't thought about it much or didn't want to say and I talked to a few Coloradans who are totally overwhelmed by the flood of campaign ads and seem more interested frankly and talking about the Rockies rocket was\nDid you get a sense of national politics are having an effect on the governor's\nRace I really did you know in in Jefferson County I met an educator a Hillary Clinton voter who strongly supports Jared polish\nJulie ... has been fired up by national politics and President Trump who she considers immoral she thinks Colorado needs polish and Democrats in charge here as a counterbalance to Republican control in Washington\nWe need to pull everybody we can a different direction because I mean I think the ... the the way Colorado is saying right now under Hickenlooper has been fine but I think with national politics the way they are we need to do what we can locally to combat those movements\nYeah I got a sense from the Democrats I talked to that national politics overshadows everything right now that state politics is just not their priority\nSure they want a democratic governor but they're more concerned about making sure Democrats win more seats in Congress to counterbalance Trump and\nThat's interesting 'cause I got a totally different than down especially in ... I didn't feel really any to that at all about the top of the ticket in this case it's the governor's race\nAnd that might be because I was talking more Republican and blue dog Democrat to you know didn't seem to be excited about Jared poll is what I did hear about all these local races under like Fifteen people I think actually more than Fifteen people running for mayor and ...\nEccentric dude he was a tenured anthropology professor at Washington state university he'd waited into like big debates of the time on human evolution and human migration he was pretty well respected serious stuff ... he donated his bones and the bones and his dogs at the Smithsonian Institution\nAnd was you know very invested in science and then there's this paragraph in there that says that he would drive around the Pacific northwest looking for sasquatch with a spotlight and a rifle\nAnd I thought wait what [laughter] but you're a professor and you are a scientist but you believe in big foot these two things I mean I thought that was just like a campfire story\nSo that's really what started me down this path that sort of thinking All right well maybe there's more to this and I originally thought and a vote the credits last name um he was so I had asthma I asked my dad and my dad said I'm not entirely sure off your grandfather and my grandfather said oh yeah\nThat's my cousin he used to come to the family picnics and measure people's heads with ... [laughter]\nAnd always practicing so I always practicing science and it was just kind of this eccentric guy and I thought All right well and he's a relative to so now I really have to do this\nAh what evidence did he find that convinced him of the creatures existence or or convinced him at at least enough to try to find out is that ... yeah so he\nSaw the casting of a set of footprints of ...\nYou pour plaster into a footprint on the ground you can preserve all of the detail and and that's it's called the cast\nAnd he saw a set of friends that had been made up in Washington state and one of them was crippled and he said the end of the er an anatomical detail on them was so good that there is no way that could have been staked\nAnd that's what convinced him this would've been back in the seventies at some point I\nUnderstand that his widow actually lives in Colorado and Parker I think yes are you also interviewed her does she believe in big foot she does\nAnd actually that you could say that big foot played matchmaker here because she had read an article in the paper talking about how this scientist in Washington state believed in Bigfoot and he's this academic and she said well I'd never\nHeard of anyone who had these kinds of credentials saying the big foot was real until she started writing to him and then he came to Denver for a lecture and then they met and it was romance\nYou're listening to Colorado matter is I'm Ryan Warner and Denver journalist Laura ... is my guest she used to be with NPR she has a new podcast the first episode dropped today it's called wild thing and it is a serious investigation of\nThe existence of big foot of sasquatch and it is also an exploration of the popular culture surrounding this beast which I Want to get into but if he believes this anthropologist and your relative that big foot was real\nDid he have some theory about what spacesuit occupied in and a male yeah or in ... evolution or watch\nYeah so Grover thought that big but it was a descendant of this giant this now extinct giant Asian ape called gigantic ... is\nThat existed you know a million years ago and his dot was it was a descendant of that come over the bearing land straits as apparently we do yes well maybe we might have come and vote with extra just I don't know if it took about\nUm but yeah the idea was its descended from this particular species so it's a in the order primate fasten it there's a whole second episode is all about evolution\nOkay how ingrained is sasquatch in in our popular culture which would say\nSo it's hard to really quantify it but I Will say that when I started thinking about Bigfoot and this is probably going to happen to you now to you're in the grocery store if you are at a bike store if you are anywhere you go you will see references to big foot in sasquatch their socks there's chocolate there's bikes are snowboards\nThere is erotica as we all know there is um there's all kinds of movies there's a publishing company and it's kind of everywhere you look\nSo there's a lot of appeal out there\nAs we all know there's erotica okay I didn't actually know that but I'm learning things from Laura ... in the series you will visit Bailey, Colorado the home of the sasquatch out post\nSo this little section here's on footprints including these trucks [noise]\nThis is our map of Colorado sasquatch sightings are big foot he called boomer\nAnd you'd be shocked at how many people never see this they come in the museum they walk around the leave and never even see this big what's an air and this was a centerpiece of all museum\nTell us about the origins of this sasquatch outpost in Colorado\nSo Bailey is a tiny little sort of to horse town and this used to be the old grocery store that was there so back in the Eighteen hundreds and its shuttered many many years ago and this couple Jim and Daphne Myers\nBought the the grocery and turned it into sort of a grocery store slash big foot thing 'cause Jim is uh he he is a very serious about Bigfoot\nUm but he also recognizes that a lot of people are fascinated by it and so it was still part grocery store and then part Bigfoot outlet kind of thing\nAnd then they realized that they could just make all of their money doing the big foot ... geographically they totally ditched the degree does and they just had the sasquatch outposts where you could go and get hiking and camping gear and all kinds of sasquatch paraphernalia and then they opened a museum\nOr sasquatch discovery museum which you just heard the the sounds from that the little who ding owls and stuff and they have a map in there and have some discussion of the different evidence and there's a giant big foot sort of tucked in behind the tree that if you weren't looking you might miss him which goes to show you if you were out in the woods and you weren't looking you might miss him was\nSpeaking of that when I think of big foot I think that iconic photo of him\nOr her a look\nFacing the camera a stride did you learn anything about that image\nOh my God I learned so much about that image so that is from the Nineteen sixty seven film called the Patterson gambling found so it was shot just over fifty years ago and I actually went to the fiftieth anniversary celebration last year which is just about a year ago\nAnd it it is a lady Bigfoot striding away through the forest\nAnd you know there's all kinds of theories about whether this is a legitimate this is actually big foot or if this is a man and a monkey suit or you know a hoax of some sort and this film which is only a minute long and it's very shaky footage\nUm it's been just analyze to death it's been stabilized and slowed down and re mastered and people have spent hours and hours and hours I said I heard one guy told me that it's been watched second only to the Kennedy assassination router fan yeah\nPodcast of course her sound driven which got me thinking about watch sasquatch might sound like you delve into this uh I think digging up some tape from big foot research websites\n[laughter]\nLearn anything from sounds [noise]\nUm well not from hearing those particular sounds necessarily you know people make recordings of stuff that they hear in the woods but the problem with that is unless you see what's making the sound it's often hard to know what's actually doing it and I heard several stories where people had thought they\nBig foot they'd recorded that they brought it into some big butt symposium\nAnd they played it for the whole audience because they were so excited and someone's like yeah that's an elk or that's an adult so at the sounds are a little bit tough\nBut you know they if you're out in the woods and you hear something like that and you're alone and you're camping that's going to make the hair on the back of your next end up how do people\nAnswer the fundamental question that a big foot existed we would have seen it by now we just be more acquainted with especially with you know satellite imagery and as much development as there is in forest land and the growth of the population in the west mhm\nI think that is probably one of the hardest questions to answer um some people just say that it's very good at staying hidden and staying out of sight you know other people will say hey we are seeing it there are eyewitness accounts is just people don't believe\nThem where do you land on this ... oh I don't know if I Want to give that away oh say that I definitely want to believe you want to believe yeah are you glad you took it on oh yeah someone who has taken on what what some might consider more serious topics\nYeah I think this has been it's been a lot of fun I met a lot of interesting people and I mean I learned some cool science along the way\nDenver journalist ... creator of the new podcast wild thing about Bigfoot which just Colorado matters from CPR\n[noise]\n\nWell for all of us in travel a lot and I'm In the same category um\nIt often happens when especially when we're off on the Himalayan expeditions that lasts for six weeks or two months and are often extended on one or the other end and um and this was the case uh Christine had been ... leading a a climb in the Himalayas a commercial climate after the clients and Charlie we're\nWe're doing what they love to do which was climate of an inclined to peak and or in a remote area and it was one that Charlie ... had his eyes on for many years so\nUm it's it's funny because you know if you have a if you have the wife waiting back home or the husband waiting back home you know you know exactly but with\nUs as friends you know it's like I didn't know and it was really the birthday celebration that sort of triggered us going well they are a little bit late you know what I'm it's in the nature of of the beast so to speak\nAnd we did find Charlie on Christmas Day and um and then finding Charlie we knew that Chris was not alive\nBut uh the weather that was full winter in the mountains at that point so that\nThe search for Chris was postponed until the spring but at that point we knew we were not looking for people that were injured and needed help which originally in the search we had no idea if they were injured if they'd been kidnapped even where you wonder you know there was\nAll ... tons of speculation but it really was a miracle that that we were able to find them at Seventeen thousand feet\nAnd watch what killed them\nWell it was most likely I'm a dramatic events either us or Iraq collapsing which is this ice feature on the very top of the mountain that came down or an avalanche or that might have triggered the other\nUh ... this idea of naming peaks for them I Will say that these are two neighboring peaks on the border of send me go indoors counties in southwest Colorado just over Thirteen thousand feet high and they're currently unnamed so how did this idea come to\nWell one of the members of our power boss toss\nSearch committee who was a ... a very good friend of ... and a fellow climber had been often in the mountains with and\nIt was really is initiation um and this was an area that Charlie loves to go in and explore these were peaks said he had climbed before in the decades that he had been in this area which is just really on the neighborhood of\nTelluride in Norwood and um and he did some research in the USGS naming because there were unnamed\nPeaks their home and was able to kind of goes through the process and when it became on a federal level that could really include Christine boss cough as well\nSo it's these are peaks that are Thirteen thousand foot peaks and you can actually see them from several places aroused and it just seems like not only a great way to honor\nCharlie and Chris but also to honor the peaks because these were really a among the best of several generations of alternate and mountaineers\nAnd not only were they incredibly accomplish climbers but they were role models that humans for so many people all over so this uh this is really an exciting\nThing for us and it's also a miracle that anything can go through Congress and passed unanimously so\n[laughter] it's a lovely the owners like this as well\nI hear your inherited cynicism there uh and as we said this away Senate approval imagine that there'll be something of a celebration maybe in Telluride or Norwood when when they finally passes Congress\nIndeed up thanks so much for being with us oh You're welcome and thank you\nMountaineers Christine ...

B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... and\nThen there are\nSome voters in Maine putting pressure on Republican Senator Susan Collins as she is seen as one of the key swing votes on whether Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court protests have continued\nCouple of weeks and yesterday nearly two dozen protesters and survivors of sexual assault showed up at ... office in Portland joining us now is Steve ... chief political correspondent for Maine Public radio he's in Augusta Steve welcome thanks for having me and when you talk to voters in Maine what's the temperature right now how much pressure they putting on Susan Collins\nWell I haven't seen anything like it to be honest with you Jeremy it's you know she's just back up a little bit Centre College has been\nUnder a lot of pressure ever since President Trump was elected president because she was always seen as sort of somebody who might be able to block his worst impulses perhaps\nAnd because her reputation as a centrist um and so everybody sort of looking to her on this particular nomination I'm as perhaps blocking it and\nYou know who knows if that's going to happen or not but the pressure has been sustained and intense and it's been ... and it's especially increased since the sexual assault allegations surfaced earlier last month\nWell but even before the allegations we know that Susan Collins says she is pro choice and many looking for a cabinet and say he is somebody who may want to overturn roe versus Wade even though he has said I guess to her privately that he thinks it's settled law\nCorrect yeah and that's that was the initial sort of trigger for the protest or other additional concerns but it's it's true that the rover versus Wade question has been sent center of mine for a lot of people and especially women who are expected to be a particularly potent force in the upcoming midterm elections\nAnd she said anything since the testimony last Thursday from Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nNot much I mean the only thing that she's said is that she is supportive of the um the FBI probe that is going to dig a little bit deeper into those allegations she has said that but other than that she's really keeping a low profile\nYou know I think probably just waiting for the outcome of that FBI a inquiry to decide how she's going to vote\nNo Maine is a state that is represented in the governor's office by pretty conservative Republican poll the page how much pressure just calling space from conservatives that's a good question I mean right\nNow what you're seeing is overwhelming pressure from a progressive groups but lying in wait I suspect if she were to vote against Kavanaugh or even signaled that she would oppose his nomination would be certainly a backlash from conservatives and\nYou know certainly governor Apollo page has exerted some of that pressure on Collins personally in the past he did it during some key healthcare votes last year\nAnd I would imagine that he would do the same if I'm Shia given any kind of indication that she would oppose Kavanaugh's nomination she hasn't done that yet she's she's struck me as somebody who's been wanting to get to yes on cabin or over the last\nMonth or so but that made you know if something happens what if something comes up during the FBI probe that raises questions for her and she somehow singles that she would oppose him I Would expect that she would see it as much pressure on the on the right and she's been seeing on the left\nSteve missile or chief political correspondent from Maine Public radio see thank you my

place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let's got tell that he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nHi thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete adding the what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives she moved you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nAnd our our costs are much lower than and you know as we got older ah and we had a baby um you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know I'll be honest the\nFinancial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties and uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city":
