NPR News Washington\nThe Taliban are claiming they were behind a deadly attack in southern Afghanistan that claimed the lives of three provincial officials including Kandahar as powerful police chief Jennifer glass reports Afghan guards carried out the attack\nConsumers equals respected and fears in Kandahar as police chief in the birthplace of the Taliban he was praised for bringing peace to the city but the Taliban tried to kill him dozens of times and really can self was controversial human rights watch called him torture in chief for alleged illegal prisons and heavy handed tactics against those who opposed him\nThat Jennifer glass reporting Harrah's returning to more communities in the Florida Panhandle devastated by hurricane Michael NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports a few school districts are set to reopen for classes next week\nSchool districts are preparing for students to return early next weekend Holmes county and Franklin County which sits along Florida's northern coast the classes are still cancelled in most parts of Florida's panhandle ravaged by hurricane Michael\nIt's not clear windows schools will reopen for students some school buildings are sheltering hundreds of families across the region as a cleanup continues after the storm\nOne the one hand there are a lot of products on the market a credit products that have a PR below thirty six percent\nBut as I said the typical payday loan customer or applicant\nHas a credit score a that's five Seventeen and low five hundreds or they're not getting credit cards they're not getting installment loans they're not getting those the sub thirty six percent of NPR loans and they're not going to get them a after this ballot initiative if it passes\nA now are these predatory loans I I think that um that's an interesting thing to talk about what does predatory mean\nUsually in the payday loan market and there are a thirty four other states in the country that have pay the loans\nOr as as well as Colorado usually in the pillow market we're looking at issues of predation or abuse with loans that are arguing full in just two weeks and they take more than one third of the customers next paycheck when they come do they have they PR is in the range of four hundred percent or higher\nOr they have pre payment penalties or other kinds of harmful practices\nThe loans and Colorado because of the two thousand ten law have none of those things so it's not clear to me what what is meant by the term predatory loan in this case\nAnd this goes back a as I said to previous legislation that's been passed in Colorado [noise] uh and so it it sounds like other access to credit would be difficult to come by\n... as you say if the interest rate has kept in Colorado at thirty six percent a payday lenders will be out of the market uh ... what do you base that claim on\n[noise] well ... as I say they're thirty five states in the country that have payday loan stores or Colorado is unique and its law\nOr the Fifteen states plus D.C that have the do not have paid alone stores\nHow they effective MPR limits in the range of thirty six percent Idaho empirically there's not a state that has that kind of a PR limit and has a store is making a credit available or like a payday loan or a small installment loan to people with this kind of credit score now\nEvery state in the country including Colorado has pawn shops and rent own stores\nWhich often cost a lot more than pay the loans every state in this country has consumers with checking accounts who have see based overdraft programs that charge a typically thirty five dollars every time somebody overdraft they're checking account but payday loan stores do not exist in states where there's an effective if you are Catholic thirty six percent\nOh All right so we can look to other states as a harbinger perhaps of what might happen in Colorado if prop ... passes on the midterm valid\nI think it's important to follow the money and the biggest contributor to one eleven is a group called the sixteen thirty fund which is based in North Carolina and fights for among other things tax fairness transparency in government and access to health care\nAnd local donors this is interesting I include the mile high United Way I Want to say that we reached out to multiple payday lenders and none would do an interview on prop one eleven but not surprisingly we can say they oppose this measure [noise]\nIs it possible that if pay the loans aren't available in Colorado that people might be a forced into more dangerous situations I mean I I don't know I don't want to paint too bleak picture but like loan sharks is that a possibility or or the idea of even physical harm or something like that\nYou know the the loan shark thing comes up often there's just no evidence of it OK I'm\nEvery now and then you will hear somebody tell a story of how they know somebody who hangs up by a check cashing shop and they'll make a few hundred dollars available in small loans to people and formally um but on a on a widespread basis it just doesn't happen and and that that's for a lot of reasons but I can tell you one big reason it doesn't happen as\nPeople who use pay the loans are generally just kind of mainstream ordinary people they want to use legal stores they don't want to go to alleyways and get cash they're looking for a place that has a sign a store\nFor Republican family her father who's still alive served in Vietnam she tears up that she recalls how the recent death and funeral of Senator John McCain touched a

known aspect of slavery will say that some listeners may find disturbing\nDenver poet dominate Christina gives voice to end in sleeved black woman who in the Eighteen hundreds endured medical experiments\nProcedures performed by a white doctor considered to be the father of modern gynecology\nChristine as new poetry collection is an ... speaks a history in poems and welcome to Colorado matters thank you for having me you right in the voices of both an orca the enslaved woman and Dr Jay ... the white doctor who experimented on her [noise]\nUh let's start with a poem written from Sims perspective Dr Sims makes something new that just set it up for us what is the new thing\nThis was really when he was at the precursor of inventing what would become the modern day speculation which is used today for pap smears and you know ... a logical exams\nAnd this grew out of his work some would say torture of slaves correct okay so let me have you read this\nDoctor Sims make something new what should happen most always is invention there is no wider mystery in the universe than that of woman what salt and bone she got\nShe is a composition of after thought a borrowed read if you know your Bible she is so easily just assembled\nI take the ruins stock of ease the wilted pedals dispense flash and bring it wire steel restoration\nEverything we delight in came first by the blood of a woman\nAnd then and then iron and what men do after\nIt is well documented that Sims experimented on female slaves as part of his gone a logical research correct [noise]\nWhat did these women endured during and after the experiments that poem really gives you the sense that there's a dehumanizing going on here\nRight and of course you know the the institution of slavery was already participating in that dehumanization and the modification of bodies so\nFor me it it's about doctors them sort of\nGlacial this inclination toward his subjects they were just subjects they were not human being they were not afforded the rights or the proper considerations that you would you know offer to a human being or someone that you respected or valued or emphasized with\nAnd fundamentally what he was trying to do because it was sort of a stigma attached to treating women I'm particularly guy like logically so he was trying to figure out a way to repair damages that were done during labor and delivery traumas specifically the ethical ... you know\nStill it tears um and so he quarter these enslaved women in this makeshift hospital behind his house in Alabama\nAnd experimented on them with the intent of perfecting that procedure and then offering it to white women and he did so without and if the anesthesia without anesthesia\nNight there was a belief I've read that a black people could not feel pain that was part of correct what was in his I'd go to the point\nThat is right that was the prevailing sort of ideology at the time that black people did not record pain in the body the same way that others did and so it was fundamentally a way to justify brutality\nAnd so for these slaves for the people he was experimenting on this would have been incredibly painful of course on for a long time of course yes we would ever have been beneficial\nTo them yeah [noise] ah it's my understanding that he did repairs some of these terrorists to the women um I think for me it's about\nProcedure um they were tortured and there was a ton of blood letting before repair was done right and so there was still no real regard for their humanity or their person HUD yes he fixed certain injuries but he created others I\nHad been hunted since reading your collection I mean just just so haunted by this history I Wonder how it affected you when you first learned about an hour 'cause story than and let's be clear that an orca is a a it was a real life person\nAbsolutely um I found her by accident I'm an animal just so I went looking for the etymology of the word anarchy and I've found is name with an ass tricks Antarctica\nAnd needed to try to track her down and it was clear that she was only the only language that was being curated for her\nWas as a means to talk about the doctor Jay Marion Sims and I was appalled by that then that would be in the ... that's right in his story that's right and not the other way around that's right and so for me it was about trying to leave enough room for her\nTo be able to speak and tell her story and and move as much of myself and my own projections out of the way which is really hard to do um but I think are really necessary thing to do if you're going to attempt to press on a ...\nAre listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're speaking with the Denver poet dominate Christina and she has a new collection of poetry called a ... speaks a history and poems\nIt should sheds light on some pretty terrible history a that on top of inflaming people in the United states slaves were also subjected to medical experiments and\nUh I I think what's what so painful and so complicated here is that much of the science the medical practice today is based on this and that's right that's right isn't that complicated yeah speaks to speak to that for me as a woman\nYou know it does it creates a tremendous complication for me I I recognize that there is always\nA balancing act that is required when we talk about what we are the beneficiaries of in our present day realities we have to at some point interrogate how we got here and often times there was torture or pain or wounding or bruising in the back of it\nAnd so it does create a complication\nFundamentally for me though and aka is not singular\nThere's still a very important an urgent conversation around women today who do not have authorship over their bodies particularly during labor and delivery you're still being prescribed and dictated to in the hospital room\nIt was very important to me that in this conversation that we hear you use a ... voice the collection and it's frankly the voice that I I'd like towards the end of the Congress issue we're left with her words would you read a poem called no magic no how yes\nNo magic know how that's when I take down my own dumb heart right there\nWhen method that to say I mule what a few more mild left to a slave us stop by Stillwater on his way to someplace right there right there when massive Dr look right passed away I hurt to say she a tough old gal can take a mighty licking\nOr what I think some breakthroughs not so long ago and I think that the the L G T cue when people are like gender career and you know just identifying that there is this social construct of a binary\nGender thing and I think what I just started asking myself when I are noticing in my act when I Am ... and when I Do an impression of a woman I I raise my voice and I talk like this\nAnd then when I Do an impression of a man I lowered my voice my talk like this I'm like oh I guess I don't identify as a man or woman as fast as somewhere in the middle I'm right there and as I'm aging\nNow I'm a I'm leaning more towards the male voice but still just saying I've always loved climbing trees and I I play dolls and climb trees and I had to hot wheels cars I just didn't understand why we had to have one or the other I never got that\nBut it's fascinating that you use the language when I impersonate a woman\nMhm yeah yeah I feel when I was in nursing school we had to wear a dress and the male nurses got to wear pants and I was so jealous and I'm like why am I having to wear this awkward dressed with uncomfortable pantyhose just because of my ex X chromosome I don't get this this is not me it was very frustrating [laughter] nursing school but I felt like I was in drag I'm like I'm In\nThis isn't I don't wear dresses you either brag or joke I'm not sure which is maybe it's a little bit of vote on the ladder that you came out before Ellen\nWell and that's kind of out of the

[noise]\nNo I just do not just\nOn my show and they had their from Marsha Blackburn campaign looking like it really wants to lash out Phil Bredesen to the Democratic party\nAnd we also heard Blackburn supporters referencing the fact that voters did at one point and vote for medicine who may not now so we talk about what his track record is um and whether or not any of this even matters his track record given the combustible politics of today\nIt does matter governor British and she is very ... everyone knows him in the state and he has always wanted to play this moderate guy right he wants to make sure he reaches across the aisle when he was a governor\nShe worked with the Republicans she worked with Democrats and he always talks about that governor medicine has also been trying to avoid democratic endorsements which is very interesting so for example he said that if you were to be elected to the U.S Senate he would not be supporting democratic leadership\nSo he will not be supporting a Chuck Schumer\nAnd he's been talking about that he's been talking about how the Democratic party needs a new leadership so he's trying to appeal to the moderates appeal to toast Republicans who might be on the fence but also uh be appealing to the Democrats\nThe Democrats on the left who has been making a showing at the polls in recent elections so let's listen to one as a governor British ... ads and these are his supporters\nI'm a lifelong Republican I'm a Republican I'm a Republican but I'm supportive of rice and 'cause he can work across the aisle and work both parties or what Democrats and I work with Republicans and sometimes that means he doesn't like everybody in his party happening bill was\nPhysically responsible for Republicans to bring them into two hundred thousand jobs while he was kept things done they'll certainly different than the crowd in Washington\nSo there you have an ad from governor Paterson's campaign he's the Democrat but obviously just as you said the audio he's trying to get those moderate Republicans who may be feeling that Marsha Blackburn too far to the right\nThat's right and he doesn't make everyone happy like the ad says for example he recently came out things you would have voted for justice Kavanaugh something that goes against the majority of the Democrats who were\nUm rallying against the justice so he is trying again to show that he is a mother that he is willing to listen to both sides and then make a decision on behalf of Tennessee and that's what he's been saying\nDuring the whole campaign but that's something that a black run campaign and specifically Marsha Blackburn has um you know used as part of of that you know attack\nAt one of the debates up Blackburn said that she had the chance to run as a Democrat he had the chance to run as a Republican or as an independent but he chose to run as a Democrat so he is part of the establishment that's what a Marsha Blackburn has tried to say during this whole campaign\nIn and trying to get the moderate Republicans away from Marsha Blackburn and doing things like can they being in favor of confirming that cannot to the Supreme Court did he run the danger of putting off people who have been loyal Democrats for years\nIt it definitely affects him and he's running with this thing that he has an in the past ... some of his volunteers are even leaving his campaign ... they can stand why he supported Brett Kavanaugh and so that's something that it's ... it's going against him and he needs to figure it out before the election\nYou know ... ... and a

power can be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic Rodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana\nWay there was three deaths and Rodney at you in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we we took a direct hit it with any of those who was at a high cats really low key\nOr which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people realized that this story does affect people that deep inland and when you've got a storm of this magnitude in movie as fast as it did it held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you do I understand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part of my roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and it it's the damage as it is just off the scales but in buildings Dale almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser Carla the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that she guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county were damaged she's using tax rules in aerial pictures is is that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nClue to go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plush are completely destroys you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr someone with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had it to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting Paulos underground and yes that is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you\nThe member Feinstein agreed to hold the sharing and with that the Republicans who were present began to review nominees to federal court judge ships\nThe office of the senior committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein denied that she agreed to the hearing has characterized in fact Democrats were so infuriated by the Republican effort to push through more confirmations\nThat they boycotted yesterday's meeting NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here to talk about this I carry hey Jeremy so after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Senate Democrats agreed to confirmed Fifteen lower court judges before reassessing until the mid terms\nBut now they say Republicans broke a promise regarding judicial nominees what's going on here\nWhat's going on here is that the Republican Party and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nHas made basically in a a bet that one of the significant and lasting accomplishments during their tenure is going to be the confirmation\nOf federal judges mostly young conservative white male federal judges to lifetime appointment on district courts and federal appeals courts around the country and these Republicans are not going to let things like the Senate recess stop them so yesterday they went ahead and held a hearing\nA for six judicial nominees even though a Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat from California the top Democrat on the committee as you noted Jeremy\nWas actually at home in California you're preparing to debate her opponent because she's running for reelection other Democrats didn't show up either in fact very few Republicans actually showed up for this hearing us so the nominees got a very very light round of questioning and moved along\nIs there anything Democrats can do to stop Republicans for doing this\n[noise] yeah they can win elections Republicans control the White House and Donald Trump has been nominating these young conservatives for the federal bench and Republicans control the Senate\nWhich has the advice and consent function here so if Democrats really want to do something\nThey're going to need to win more elections now if you talk to\nA progressive advocates and activists out there and they said that Democrats could have been firmer and standing up last week and not agreeing to this deal to confirm Fifteen federal judges before they left town for the recess\nOr there are some things on the margins that Democrats could do more of but by and large the Republicans hold the power here and they're using it\nAnd just give us a sense of what we missed yesterday who got through\nYes so then the main focus of yesterday's hearing was a young woman lawyer named Allison rushing she's been nominated to serve on the federal appeals court for the fourth circuit Jeremy\nShe has only thirty six years old she's one of the youngest people we have seen in a generation or two I nominated to a federal appeals court she was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and also a clerk for Neil Gorsuch now on the Supreme Court\nShe has a conservative bona few days and uh it's highly regarded in that conservative all the legal community out there\nThat that there's anything wrong with thirty six year olds because I'm thirty six right now NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson
