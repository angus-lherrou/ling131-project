but then [noise]\nAnd I find that on my ... of the [noise]\nThat you were headed for months just quoting here vibrant and sociable and the day of the loan and miserable in my head at night\nAnd then one night you say you couldn't bear it anymore\n[noise] it's really sad to hear you read that out loud [laughter] I wrote it and I lived it but that that was sad so that night was just absolutely dreadful I mean I was convinced that this is the way it will always be and I couldn't see a way out\nAnd that's often a function of deep depression\n... ... ... and here I'm not talking about depression as being in a blue moon or feeling down or I'm In and depressed me and I'm Talking about depression as a as a clinical phenomenon\nAnd one thing we know is that it's a cognitive phenomenon too so that people who have depression\nTheir problem solving ability is greatly reduced and that's where suicide can really become alluring is that they can't see other ways to solve their problems they can't see other ways out of their pain\nWhat would you like to share about your suicide attempt if anything\nI'm well I think the most important thing would be that change is possible you know that in in that state of mind people can get to a place where they think it's impossible to feel better\nBut if they're focused solely on how bad it is is there a possibility of changing their mind yeah this is a critical question about youth suicide in particular\nYes I think you know even if you can only change their mind like even if just in a conversation you can inject just a little bit of hope are a little bit of light\nThen they know that it's possible to feel different\nAnd I think this is something we're seeing with a new drug called ketamine not very new but it's being nearly tested with suicidal people\nIt's having dramatic effects and I think part of it is that it's very temporary but at least then people can see okay I can feel differently it takes the blinders off yet but even if temporarily\nIs this something you're seeing prescribe more and more\nIt's still on the experimental stages though\nI Wonder if there's a power to being a therapist who has had the experience that patients might be going through\nI think that there are some gifts and then I think there are some things to be to be aware of it as well but I mean I think one thing that I take from my experience is I'm not scared to talk about suicidal thoughts with my clients\nAnd I speak with a lot of therapists because I provide consulting too who are just terrified of even asking somebody if they're having suicidal thoughts and they ease\nThe fear that if they ask they might ... the idea\nYes very much that's their fear and in reality people know about suicide already we're not telling them something they don't know but the other fear is that the person will say yes and then they were afraid of what to do and how they do it\nWhy don't we take a break and then pick up this discussion in just a little bit you're listening to Colorado matters and Ryan mortar and\nMy guest is Denver a psychotherapist Stacey Frieden soul she studies suicide and she didn't reveal actually until many

org to make your gift on line or call it in one eight hundred for nine\nSix Fifteen thirty thank you so much we are so grateful for your generosity\nThis is Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar tonight longtime Denver developer and preservation is Dana Crawford will receive the governor citizenship medals for her pioneering work to revitalize historic buildings and urban areas in this state\nOne of Denver's most charming blocks ... square was saved from the wrecking ball more than fifty years ago because of Crawford\nShe went on to develop other historic properties in the city including the Oxford hotel Union Station and the flour mill lofts where she now lives and it's where we went recently to catch up with Crawford what eighty seven is working on new preservation projects around Colorado\nShe's also speaking out against a plan to build two new towers on Larimer square\nAs we were setting up Crawford recalled her quest decades ago to preserve the flour mill building\nI thought this building with just stunning and most everybody thought I was insane and the neighbors all called this see through building and they wanted it torn down\nSee through as in it looked bombed out the Crawford managed to convince city leaders and investors that the building was worth saving and converting into loft\nWe were a little bit under construction but no glass was in the windows and the trains go by you know twenty five feet from here\nSo the two of my four cents or sitting up here and the train goes by and it sounds like an atomic bomb 'cause we have doubled lazy now and there's a train going by right now big coal train but you can hear it [laughter] anyway So Peter sister's younger brother she's really lost at this time [laughter] you\nKnow sitting at her dining room table I asked in Crawford about the future of ... square just a few blocks away\nJeff hermanson announce this proposal he CEO of Larimer associates which owns the block the idea was to add to new multi story buildings one with affordable housing but it would mean the partial demolition of several old buildings what do you believe is wrong with the\nPlan well I have to say that when I first thought\nI was intrigued however when I began to study it and I realized that one of the high rise buildings was to be forty stories high and it would involve being superimposed over one of the most important in historic buildings the Sussex\nIt would have dark and all of them are square practically and one\nOf my favorite times of year is when the kids come down in the spring and the third grade in fourth grade when they studied Colorado's history and they can actually see and feel a commercial district from around the turn of the last century pretty low slung one yeah\nAnd the world was fun man and so they have an opportunity to really understand and feel\nWhat their community came from so that would be ended I think that many of the tenants that have been there a long time would not be able to remain a as you mentioned the demolition of part of the buildings\nSo ... square present day defense what they're trying to do is figure out how to finance the ongoing maintenance of those buildings and here comes a trained by the way yes\nI'm so that was I think the thinking behind building these two new buildings in getting income from them to finance the improvements\nOr rehabilitation from my perspective and now since I've talked to so many people about it from a lot of perspective it's not only kills Larimer square but it also threatens everything we've worked\nOn all these years to get the character maintained throughout the city because if they do that to learn more square then it opens up the political gates to change everything\nI mean the plan came under heavy criticism is I think you're reflecting there from preservation lists including the national trust for historic preservation\nWhich put Larimer square on its list of America's eleven most endangered historic places will say the owners have put the plan on hold but they say ... squares buildings need significant rehabilitation is it possible to do that\nWith out changing wherever squares character\nAbsolutely yes it's been done all over the country Charleston South Carolina Philadelphia Boston buildings much older than ours so it can be done\nI think there are some who would just be perplexed by the idea that ... square could be fundamentally changed at all if it's on a register ... helped me understand the\nWell the kind of tragic thing in a way is fifty percent of the buildings that have been placed on the national register had been demolished a there is no protection for them there is protection usually in local and marketing and ... square is the local landmark\nI should point out the Denver city council president Elvis Brooks told the Denver Post tearing down any historic building is dead on arrival and he edited revitalization and preservation can co exist\nThat is exactly correct\nOur encore conversation with Dana Crawford continues in a moment we'll move beyond Denver and talk about some of her current projects like the historic Argo mine and

criticizing the Federal Reserve board for raising interest rates\nCalling it a ridiculous policy have interest rates going up and it flips that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nThe president said he knows more about interest rates then members of the Federal Reserve but he said he does not intend to fire fed chairman Jerome Powell in the past twenty four hours the president has also called the Federal Reserve board crazy ... the director of the national economic council Larry Kudlow and said the president is not trying to dictate policy to the fed\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again at a December meeting analysts say it's not likely that will change because of today's report that the consumer price index rose one tenth of ... percent last month\nThe federal emergency management agency says it's focusing on search and rescue in the Florida Panhandle today as now tropical storm Michael ... northeast over the Carolinas NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nSeem administrator Brock Long says it appears that the town of Mexico beach was

with this in the district attorney's office lied and effective let the investigation submitted what he believed to be serious for all the time but\n[noise] Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this was the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen very\nWarm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it did lead intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore [noise] um and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase as it approached land\nWe've had several hurricanes in the last decade that have weakened as they approached land a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they didn't hold up in terms of the forecasts of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nWell just like Florence the track forecast when the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecast have improved remarkably over the decades\nBut the intensity forecast are still very challenging the science is still lagging behind a bit on forecasting exactly how intense storm maybe when it actually comes ashore\n[noise] you've track a lot of hurricanes Jeff what stood out to you about Michael\nUm [noise] I think probably how far inland the hurricane force winds stretched we had I think especially a cat three when it crossed into Georgia or the I was extremely compact and it it just barrel through it was a hundred miles inland the there was still a communist\nIn the center of this storm that from a meteorological perspective\nThat's wasn't ... I don't want to say this was impressive Jeremy but right now I'm I'm very uh I guess it's worth noting that right now we only have two fatalities because I Do believe people got the message with this one even though it was only get two or three day preparation period just goes to show you that the message is getting out on the dangers of these hurricanes\nEspecially when you look at the devastation that we're already seeing in places like Mexico Beach Florida it's great that so far the level of fatalities is pretty low Jeff Hoffman urologist with the Florida public radio emergency network thanks so much\nLike your Jeremy\nFollowing hurricane Michael just a few weeks ago Hurricane Florence and I know NPR and CPR is vital to that coverage so many people listening right now to\nTo

Washington Post is reporting that U.S intelligence officials believe that Saudi operatives may have tried to spirit post columnist your mouth 'cause she ... away from the Saudi constantly in Turkey to detain him but something went wrong and he was killed\nTurkish officials released video of him entering the conflict but there's none of him leaving NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik has some thoughts\nI dated hey Robin and then we have President Trump on Fox News today we'll get to that but he said of show these disappearance it's not good he said if the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was behind it it would be sad\nBut he also cultural is the enemy of the people and we had that uh California man arrested for threatening to kill reporters quoting the president saying they were the enemy of the people so this is an interesting needle for Trump to thread what\nShouldn't be that tough you know it took Trump basically a week to condemn and he said it's bad if this happened to for reporters it's bad would happen to anybody he has tried to forge a strong relationship with the Saudis and he's doing it seems to me the bare minimum to express concern about this a disappearance\nSo well and what about um the politics of it the Saudis of course a strong ally\nIn some ways that the hinge on which the president of the administration's Middle Eastern policy seems to pivot wouldn't be clear as you said the Washington Post is reporting that the crown prince was the one who had set up a plot according to a intelligence intercepted by U.S authorities\nDesigned to trap ... in Saudi Arabia and detain him there so it suggests that you know the good intentions of the Saudis who say that they are concerned for the ... disappeared journalist wellbeing as well\nMay not be all that jazz we'll talk more about that because this part was when the show he\nWas at home in Virginia and intelligence is showing that\nThe Saudis were trying to you know kind of lure him from Virginia to Saudi Arabia to detain him and there's a lingering question about what U.S intelligence officials knew and what the Trump White house might have known and when they knew it and whether or not they should have warned him about it\nSure according to the reporting\nIt suggests that there's an obligation from federal authorities to inform somebody if their life appears to be in threat could show you had talked to associates of his growing concerns\nAbout the Saudi regimes intentions toward him and let's be clear this is a place but it's actually is that the very bottom of the world press freedom index\nArrest somebody for so what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Balanchine\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is certainly when we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded ... responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice said makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nUm are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not and so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here\nUm they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and and they do that so\nUm the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they common right\nSo um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what an minister ration Bush Obama and Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues or here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants to about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the Tehran\nSo but isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can't communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that to happen\nWe know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year individuals criminals in our care who ice a place to detain are on that we could not return dies they released back to the community one hundred and forty of those have already been re arrested\nFor new crafts for for attempted murder\nOf several for assault with a deadly weapon one for child molestation one for spousal rape numerous other crimes that are occurring that one of the forty and those are only the ones that we know about because a return to our jail", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "11"}
