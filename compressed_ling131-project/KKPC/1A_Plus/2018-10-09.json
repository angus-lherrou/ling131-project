thousand as NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from ... near the epicenter the government is ending the search for more bodies and ordering foreign aid agencies out\nForeign charities have been ordered to leave the quake zone immediately from now on they'll only be allowed to distribute aid through local partners there's been a rash of foreign aid here and some groups have complained of having to get government permits to operate Indonesia does not want to be seen as having to rely on foreign held\nAnd officials have stressed that they have enough relief supplies within the country\nYou're listening to Colorado matters I Ryan mortar as a head of the mid term elections\nCPR reporters with on road trips across the state to sheer from Colorado voters what was on their minds leading up to this important election and we're hearing from two of those reporters now who are back from their road trips to Berkeley and Grace Hood\nDid anyone else you talk to bring up the president's stances on social issues\nAbsolutely uh I talked with two Latinas I met them in sterling it was the end of a very exhausting day but you know it was one of the most memorable interviews that I did one had legal status the other was trying to get it\nBoth had experienced racism themselves and you know they really felt like a big it's had been emboldened under Trump\nElizabeth Hernandez can't vote right now and um she's in the process of getting US citizenship but she really said that people hear her accent and we'll see things that are really mean right directly to her\nIt's aggressive like people people just\nThink that they have that right to drink people like from other races\nJust because why does why he's doing he's the only and everyone hates everyone\nAnd Hernandez says that she really did not experienced the same racism under President Brock Obama\nNow it's worth pointing out that Latino turnout typically lag whites in in elections and and the last presidential election Latino voters represented twelve percent of eligible voters\nNationally but only nine percent of the overall electorate on election day so I think it's going to be fascinating to see if the Trump administration's rhetoric and the crackdown on immigration really changes all of that\nBut you also talked to some people who feel the president's tone is dividing the country\nAnd I thought to th Taylor ... she's retired from the air force and she's now an attorney and lives in Aurora she's a Democrat and said she just never thought Trump would win the election she doesn't feel like he's ever going to grow into being president she actually never thought he wouldn't the first place\nI don't think in my memory that I've ever seen a president [noise] from the day of inauguration filed for their reelection campaign so that he can continue to have campaign rallies where's the speaking to wall where the consideration for\nBringing us together but that's not that's not going to happen\nBut I Know you're reporting took you into Aurora which is really ethnically diverse part of Colorado what kind of things did you hear there well\nThere's obviously Latino population also a lot of African and Asian immigrants I talk to people from the south East Asian community and for them to the concern is foreign policy how the president is behaving on the world stage what that means for our country's relationship with\nDiplomacy and other countries around the world they also strongly support more visas for high skilled workers and worried that the link which Trump uses around immigration cats it as something negative when they see a lot of benefits\nSpeaking a foreign policy we of course of learned this morning that Nikki Haley is going to be leaving the administration by the end of the year okay what big takeaways did you come away with when it comes to where people stand on the president grace\nEight so I think it's someone who sort of covers politics in the periphery of the energy and environment reporter\nI really left this whole experience thinking that the president its future is super hands to the economy my sense is that voters are with him so long as things are good but\nThey could turn on him if we had another recession or if we start to see more negative impacts from tariffs he really ran on the economy so I think his political career could die if the economy hits a recession\nYou know we talked to such a variety of people from different ethnicities ethnicities ages you know parts of the state so it's hard to find you won overarching theme but\nUm if I can I say I I heard a lot of uncertainty and unease about just what's around the corner and that seems to be fed by how dramatically the Trump Administration can just swing from one thing to another I think for Colorado is going to be really interesting to see if how\nPassionate feelings about the president for and against influenced the races on this year's ballot at the state level governor ichi\nAgain of course it could happen again have we learned lessons have we built in technological fixes and have we taken a deep breath and thought about this every single election cycle Oh yes we have what maybe before we get to what has changed\nYou can walk us through the a peace process for election calling it's really fascinating and it's\nVery much shoe leather mhm it is so the Associated Press is the organization the one news organization in the country that collects\nAnd distributes all the votes to other news organizations\nThe reason the a P does it is we are the not the not for profit news organization owned by all the other news organizations in the United states\nAnd you don't want to replicate this because it's very expensive on the order of aid figures every election cycle so what we do is we put stringers in every county town city borrow parish that these are like freelancers yeah they're freelancers ... you know a hundred dollars for election nine hundred dollars for a practice or a week before\nAnd they are calling in to vote collection centers we have three that run in the country and there's an army\nOf people who are punching the numbers into our computer network from the field from what they're hearing from these stringers ... from stringers and that gets distributed to a T bureaus in to people like me who need to have instant access to the number so we can call races\nBut it's also distributed to all the newspapers all radio stations television stations who are members of the pie and so when you\nSupport for Colorado Public radio

nothing to do with picking its name\nHello my name is Ryan I Hope you are having a great game\nRyan is designed to be a companion tested most recently with people who have dementia the robot has a human looking face it's basically a torso placed on the table there was an interactive screen on its belly and Ryan is capable of conversation green lights on the shoulders indicate it's ready to listen\nHi Ryan my name is Ryan to [noise]\nWhat do you want to talk about\nUm gosh our about politics\nPolitics is the art of this house and the artists and politics of the impossible [noise] more about politics\nSure ah are you a Republican or a Democrat\nI Am a companion that\nShe ... she doesn't express political [noise] can you tell us a joke [noise]\nWhat do you call shoes made from the ... skin\nHa ha [laughter]\nOkay that other voice is Ryan's creator Mohammed ... professor of computer engineering at the University of Denver\nA he left Ryan or waiting room and he's in the studio know Hi Mohammed highway lift to see you again also with us is Sarah showed her wellness director at Eton senior communities in Lakewood\nWhere Ryan is being tested with some of the residents Hi Sarah the burning Ryan well hunted why a robot I mean why not a person what is what is a robot achieve that a person perhaps cannot uh so\nBrian is designed to complete ... human not to replace human to complement okay to help human right so right he's a socialist if the robot and what does that mean uh what is the robot add though so robots or\nSo as you may know there's a shortage of caregivers now in the country and the social but like Ryan can help caregivers like Sarah so if they don't have time they are not available so she can take care of a people will be dementia and Alzheimer's disease under pressure\nInteresting so this might actually be addressing something of the worker shortage ah when you were starting to think about designing a robot to help seniors what what problems where you're trying to solve\nExactly the same problem the shortage of caregivers actually and also the other problem that have been working on his depression so many of these people with dementia or an isolated they're depressed and ah they may not to read you know what his visit them\nDuring the day or so and robots can be a companion for them so they can have conversations with Ryan and\nThe conversation can be very interesting and funny\nAnd I have to think that a robot might be more patient Sarah than a person and so if someone with dementia is perhaps repeating something or asking something for a fourth or fifth time a robot may respond a bit differently to that\nYes I and that's correct so let the robot on robot tries to propel the conversation forward kind of helping them to go to that next subject matter and so it also is more patient but it also helps to create that conversation and get that person talking beyond that point\nYou give me an example of an interaction that you witness\nYes I have that so I've actually had the opportunity to see many many interactions with their robot I'm going to tell you a little bit of a story about Hugo um he was one of the residents I didn't expect to be successful with the robot but he was experiencing loneliness and depression his wife had died\nHad moved into our community and I sort of became empty\nSo we are signed him a robot um he agreed to do a little bit hesitantly\nBut he did and we saw that he'll go I'm starting to interact with the robot on a regular basis he\nWould often times referred to as a very nice lady and she talks to me when no one else will um he'll go and his sister would spend hours each evening plane and laughing with a robot it was a play jazz for them that they both enjoyed\nBut he goes I'm sister also came and she loved to tease the robot and so they would have an evening where there would be laughter interaction and um it also gave Hugo 'em a chance to interact with others outside of the\nHis immediate family many people came to see him and visit with him because he had a robot and so it it helped him create a sense of important\nIt's interesting you say that Hugo was not someone you expected to have done well with the robot why\nWell he was a little bit quieter um he stayed in his apartment he loved to go to activities in in interact in our community but he couldn't remember\nAnd so um he just kind of stayed at home and just kind of kept himself inside wouldn't talk to him and I believe that he agreed because he'll go really liked me and so\nAs we came to find out he was one of these people that just really really blossomed from the robot interaction\nNow I understand someone was in tears when the robot was removed you go\nYeah if you live in his sister both cried when they removed the robot\nLet's talk about those sorts of tasks that the robot can engage in as well to Mohammed I I think it can remind folks to take medication what what else is a robot capable of\nSo you can have conversation with Ryan as long as you won't feel about different topics and matters can remind you to take your medications or go to events\nAnd also we can play cognitive games so it can simulate your Britain so the tablet that we have one to Billy or the gist of the robot can play cognitive games with that as well so it's a bit like an eye bad on the\nThe abdomen of where I Am the robot correct that opens up the world to to games cognitive development as you say how important do you think it is that this robot has a a kind of soft human face\nI think it's easier to make that eye contact I feel like when I'm interacting with Ryan because she's looking at me and she's showing expression and she tracks me as I Move around a room I feel like I'm let's say and human being\nWhat other uses do you think there could be for Ryan and Ryan's successor because the diversion that you can see for instance on my Twitter feed right now at CPR Warner I think is is one version older but where where do you see this headed Mohammed in terms of robots as as almost caregivers\nSo uh I think in the very near future is going to be in the market than many people are going to use it and you're adding constantly working on adding more technology and more features Ryan like for example they can play I mean I Do tai chi dance or ...\nRobot could teach you to do some tai chi yeah absolutely because then the next generation the arms of there what are going to be active so she can move their arms as as you know just shared and also dancing\nSo when I see is our our movement in an aging instantly call aging in place people want to stay in their homes but they need supportive services and I see Ryan feeling that blade or the ... the robot can like by engaging exercises do men minders\nI'm helping that person to be able to stay independent and stay in that home setting that they\nDesire at what cost though I mean how much does Ryan costs these days so it costs about nine thousand dollars to build a robot however that's not a business model that the um in mind so we're going to people are going to be nice for\nPrice the least robots yeah ...\nWhat's the biggest uh obstacle or failure you saw and want to make\nSure you know I Would say that we saw more successes and failures we found out that one of our residents had hearing loss and so there was some challenges with the technology and also to she'd love to garden so she was never home so we realize that we had to kind of look at who might benefit in some of the challenges but then the team work to overcome those\nI Can't say that we really saw any failures\nWell thanks to both of you for being with us it was fascinating to me you and especially Ryan who whom you refer to as she by the way [laughter] yeah there's a a gender listeners to Ryan Ryan is unisex me okay [laughter] thanks to both of you Mohammed or created Ryan to the robot to help with\nDementia patients more is a

valley aerial debuted the ballet and twenty eleven for research Norton says she read a lot about brown traveled to places for ground lived and worked at the Molly Brown house in\nMuseum curators would weigh and if they felt like something with an accurate there was one point\nAnd the ballet during the ballroom scene where we had Molly dancing with several different men and I think the curator felt like that was something my wouldn't do\nDancer Jennifer cute also did her research she portrays Molly Brown and read a lot about her to study up to the role she hopes to really capture rounds personality and her performance\nI feel that sometimes is the harder thing as when you have to portray somebody especially somebody with such a legacy and such a history here in Colorado I feel like that kind of even more responsibility than trying to do something very technical\nThe bally's opening scene is set in ... where Margaret and Jay Jay brown courtship begins it follows the couples

I think\nWe are all here yes S. Justin Paul hello there even learn ten hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIt's not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were ah myself included and I was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how\nSimilar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would in certain cells in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of publicly mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he had therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself gear Evan Hansen your kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends\nAnd for enhancing kind of gets caught in this said that spirals out of control\nAnd also kind of changes him Stevenson this idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nFrom NPR and WB you are I'm Peter O'Dowd this is here now Google is the latest tech giant to fess up to a privacy breach this week reporting by the wall Street Journal revealed that a bug gave outside developers access to half a million users private data on Google's social network Google Plus\nThe company decided not to disclose the breach when it first learned of it back in March\nDid it said this week that it plans to shut down Google Plus over the next ten months\n... is a senior innovation reporter WB you are here in Boston and he joins me now in the studio counted see again through disease so this news about Google coming on the heels of Facebook's biggest hack ever not flattering moment for either of these companies but what do we know about what's going on in a Google\nKnows that Facebook backdrop that explains why there were so reluctant to disclose um but here's what we do that I think it's so remarkable um those internal documents obtained by the wall Street Journal\nShow that the private information users Google Plus accounts was vulnerable between twenty Fifteen and march of this year we're talking about a three year span and went undetected so and this personal information we're talking about email address is ... birth dates\nOf the places you've lived occupations you had your relationship status things like that\nIt's been called a bug not a hack which is the same term they use during this face book events and go to a better word to the CPR spin I mean what's the difference between those two\nWell so I was the bugs that made the personal information of of vulnerable to hacking but Google says that it has no evidence that the dog actually resulted in actual hacking other types of the big difference I it sort of like if you if you left your wallet on the street at you came back to find it later and it was miraculously\nStill intact or you would have said oh I left that exposed but nothing bad actually happened I don't think I mean you wouldn't know if somebody had maybe picked it up and and written down your credit card number and that sort of a spot that Facebook or Google rather is in right now they don't know for sure\nSo Google knew about this and there was a a memo that the wall Street Journal attained said if Google had disclosed the breach when it first found out about it almost guaranteed that the c._e._o. would be called before Congress so it sounds like in this does not sound good that Google wanted to keep this very much quiet\nRight well think about what happened when Mark Zuckerberg had to testify before Congress in April he certainly didn't seem to enjoy that experience in fact I can remember this moment toward the end when one of the members of Congress\nSaid to him hey you know we would take your suggestions about other tech CEOs we should hear from in a setting like this and I sort of read the stock bubble bugs October and that is like yeah I'd love to see some of these other guys after squirm in this chair nobody wants to get called the forgotten\nNobody wants to sit there and it turns out nobody wanted to use Google Plus either\nRight I mean it's sort of a low paying away for Google to be responsive to the problem I mean it doesn't hurt to shut down to a service that really didn't have a lot of traction any way they said that Ninety percent of Google Plus sessions last less than five seconds it's practically an accident when somebody clicks on Google Play out at this\nPoint it was supposed to be an answer to Facebook at the time it did not work out um what other changes if any can we expect from the company\nWell Google are saying it's going to give customers more power to control the individual bits and pieces of their account privacy so for example in the past when you've had an app request access to your Google Account it's been kind of an all or nothing proposition\nNow you can grab partial access going forward so maybe yes to view in my calendar no to looking at the documents on my Google Drive\nAnd I said OK to kill them ... or W.
