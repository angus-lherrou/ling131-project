deception and ... and the Saudis account so far\nJared Kushner was pressed on the Saudis credibility during a CNN for I'm In New York city he says the administration is still gathering evidence about the show ... killing from a variety of sources and then ultimately it'll be up to President Trump to decide how to respond\nCushion are stressed the Saudis have been strong I was in the administration's efforts to contain influence over on\nThe middle east is a rough place it's been a rough place for a very long time and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives but we also have to deal with obviously what seems to be a terrible situation\nThe presidential son in law has formed a personal relationship with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... mom ... says he's urged the brands to take this situation seriously because he says the world is watching Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\nWell a Turkish state run news agency is reporting now the police have sealed off the entrance to an underground car part we're vehicle belonging to the Saudi conflict has been found\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman at his body guards are implicated in cars show jeeze disappearances suspected murder the Washington Post columnist was last seen some three weeks ago when he visited the Saturday constantly and assemble\nAfter initially denying knowledge of the dissident journalists whereabouts over the weekend Saudi officials acknowledged his show jeeze death\nTheir story is if a journalist died in a fist fight inside the consulate in that Saturday hit men loyal to the crown prince had nothing to do with it however Turkish and other governments say\nThey're not buying that story early voting begins today in Florida including in the eight counties struggling to recover from hurricane Michael from member station WFSU Lynn had a report hundreds of local precincts were damaged or destroyed during the storm\nIn addition to an extended period of early voting voters can also request their mail in ballots and those ballots can be sent to address is other than the ones on file in Tallahassee deputy Leon county election supervisor Chris Moore says the move makes sense\nBut rather watch two more days of that so they'll just be able to stay put and whatever they need for early voting stay there for the Monday or Tuesday as well\nUm but of those who were school age there wasn't there were a significant number that had been removed from school and we're being home schooled there were there are several high profile cases in Colorado a one was the ... Amanda Joel off who was prosecuted after her child was found\nUm he had escaped from the room where she kept him virtually tied up and he was found in foraging for food and and crouching under a neighbor's porch\nUm and there was also the um Chandler graph in her case and I think in two thousand seven in Denver where he was removed\nSpecifically after I'm a school had made a number of reports of concern about bruising and marks on the child um he was coming to school in December without shoes on and he was removed from uh Denver public school and a few months later I'm starve to death basically\nIn both those cases the home schooling a sort of excuse ...\nYeah and you know and there was no evidence that any home schooling took place\nNew alone is that only two states require background checks on adults who provide home education Colorado's not one of them are a bit on the other hand privacy is a big part of this debate I mean if you spoke with James Mason an attorney for the home schooled legal defense association\nThat organization represents eighty thousand member families across the U.S including some two thousand here in Colorado and he told you quote\nHorrific cases create horrific law and says it's it's not fair to scrutinize families who home school because of isolated cases of abuse right well what do you say to that and I wonder what kind of reaction you've gotten to the reporting\nWell a lot of angry home schooling families ah his but again this is not intended as as you know an attack on those who legitimately are home schooling their their children\nOr you know his reaction and I and I think the reaction is indicative of this the standout a home schooling advocates have taken any time there has been\nAny attempt to to strengthen the laws are the safety net is that it's an intrusion it's an invasion of privacy and that it is not fair because the vast majority of them are doing it the best they can to to educate their children and have no intention of abusing their children\nAnd they should not be required to exchange their privacy for the safety of a very few\n[noise] it seems that a law might be narrowly tailored to those parents who withdraw their children from particular district and who have had cases are reports of alleged abuse\nWell a number of the child advocates I talked to seem to think that that would be a good idea that has certainly in the case of a child who has been\nUm the subject of an investigation regarding abuse that there should be some kind of automatic follow up with windows ... children are removed from school California tempted something like this but I think was not successful California attempted ah after that you're in case they did um introduced legislation that would have required\nAn annual visit among other things in annual visit by some one outside the family someone who would be a mandatory reporter like a teacher or a a health care professional\nWith a child at least once a year and that met with fierce up position by home schooling advocates and the the legislation was defeated\nThank you for sharing your reporting with us thank you Karen ... is an

everyone who can vote knows that's actually the case including people in jail but should the right to vote includes felons we continue now with ... the political podcast from CPR\nHosts sand brash looks at what could be next in Colorado When it comes to inmates and elections\nThe bill we're talking about this episode the one that gives parolees in Colorado the chance to re register to vote\nIt has a redemption story of its own it died and was resurrected and that's not something that happens very often at the Capitol let me explain Senate bill one fifty ran into trouble at its very first committee hearing it had Republican and democratic sponsors but Republicans on the panel they weren't so sure about it\nIf someone is off Pearl\nReally wants to know it should be their responsibility\nAt first the bill died on a party line vote with Republicans and opposition\nAnd it's been ...\nBeen a day later one of those Republicans decided to revive it\nAs it and how safe but I'm sure I Know he has some good discussion\nToday and uh haven't voted on the prevailing side of that of a one fifty I Move for immediate and a reconsideration\nThe change of heart came from state senator Owen hell a Republican from Colorado Springs [noise]\nSometimes you have to have the humility to admit that you don't make the right vote in Mary that humility with the courage to change your vote I guess we won't parolees to become productive members of our society and we would be foolish to diet and the chance to prepare for the responsibility the constitution very clearly gets them\n[noise]\nIn other states like Florida and Virginia the voting rights of ex felons has become a brutally part of an issue\nBut in Colorado it has its share of Republican champions not just hill secretary of state Wayne Williams is also a Republican any lobbied for this bill his office has also moved to make it easier for jail inmates\nI certainly believe in\nThe opportunity to to serve your time and then go forward or to repent then change ah and you know I think that's what most of us hope uh we do a as we make mistakes as what we should hope for others [noise]\nPer Williams some of this has to do with his Mormon faith certainly that shapes my values and um you know as we work to garner support for it from folks that might\nNot normally be opposed we didn't talk about the ability of that redemption that ability to come back to the phones [noise]\n\nRedemption was also an important idea for state senator Kevin ... Republican from Loveland he co sponsored the bill that passed the state legislature earlier this year it was actually one of his last accomplishments has a lawmaker he's term limited and won't be back at the start of the next session but so can I say senator Lautenberg ... that I can still say that\nRight up until the next to the to the next assembly is actually seated in\n... [noise] I connected with one bird from his home studio in and out to all Colorado lawmakers if you want some goodwill with radio reporters have a home studio\nI Believe\nThat to anybody who goes to the prison system has a lot of strikes against them coming out of the system and I mean we loaded up with with so many barriers to bringing people back into being functioning citizens licenses that you cannot obtain if you have a\nFelony on your record for example or hiring obstacles as well yes I Believe in personal responsibility but I don't believe the government should be putting on a national obstacles for that individual to get back into society\nThis is not a big element of that but it is a component to put people back on their feet [noise]\nWhat do you hope that this says to someone and they're getting out of prison when they meet with their parole officer and they her about\nPre registration say and regaining the right to vote what do you hope that says to someone who would soon be completing a criminal sentence\nOr two things come to my mind one I use the term redemption which I think it helps them recognized that they have paid their debt\nSecondly however you should give them that sense of responsibility which is essential for us to middle do the right thing when we are living in this uh this this land a freedom\n... what do you mean that it gives the former prisoner that sense of response\nYeah it's it's one of those components a of a living a good life if you will to to understand that you have a responsibility to look after the interests of everyone through your voting privileges or our rights\nAnd it's it's not everything but it is one component\nFor giving people the proper motivation to do the right thing in their lives I you know again I don't think it's it's the cure all but I Believe it's a it's the right\nStatement that we make to that person coming out of the prison system okay you're done you're now citizen again and we're going to help you get back on your feet by helping you I'm a registered to vote\nHow have you talked about this bill with other members of your party I mean have you said the same things we've been talking about about redemption and and making sure that people understand rights that currently exists what have you said to get them on your side well\nTo me and important component is that to this is not a first step towards giving a convicted felon in prison voting\nBecause in Colorado if you're convicted of a felony while you're serving your sentence and that means either imprisoned or on parole you do not have the voting rights of a citizen that is a part of your penalty for having committed a felony in the state of Colorado\nI Believe that that's inappropriate point\nThat should be kept in place and if if we wanted to change that I think we need to put it within the whole context of okay we are now reducing the penalty for every crime in the state of Colorado is that really what were intending to do here\nThere are again only two states that never remove someone's voting rights after a criminal conviction in Maine and Vermont people in prison on a felony charge in vote just in Cooper the activists from the top of this episode wants to see Colorado move in that direction\nColorado has an opportunity to lean towards that foolery in franchise men I'm a restoration of all rights right as it relates to voting we'll see we'll ... we'll hope to get there I think it's an opportunity for Colorado I'm to be a leader in that in that sense disliked Vermont writer Maine\nWhich means this truth this moment of bipartisan ... around and fell in voting rights to be a fleeting thing in Colorado so far it's focused on helping people understand when they regain their voting rights\nA future fight could be about something much bigger\nWhether they should ever lose that right in the first place\nCPR Sam brash on the effort to make sure everyone who can vote gets the

good guy engaged backlash marijuana actually are strong candidate vote for our vote yes on sixty four [noise] okay so just wandered away from that\nIs pretty vague it said you know to construct construct new school to reconstruct or schools or something like that\nOkay yep something like that first thing to note is not all of the pot revenue goes to school about sixty percent for other departments most of dealing with the regulation of marijuana like preventing illegal grow operations and distribution\nAnd for other public services like jail diversion programs and impaired driving campaigns\nSo about thirty percent set aside for schools but wait it just isn't for anything schools really needs to stay open so teacher salaries whatever that they can't use it for teacher salaries are textbooks or bus drivers are keeping the lights on some of the special\nPot sales tax does fund one time grant schools can use for things like keeping kids off drugs preventing bullying promoting literacy and a separate tax on marijuana growers is contributing to a fund for repairing and renovating school buildings fixing roofs and occasionally building new schools\nChristian Hoffman from evergreen gets it\nWas supposed to go to buildings repair new schools with my interest\nBut she and her friends see that in Jefferson County there is a half a billion dollar bond measure on her local ballot to repair and renovate old school that's why she asked drew Colorado wonders\nWhere is the marijuana and many from taxes that was supposed to help offset some of those costs yes\nIt's supposed to offset those tough but here's why it simply isn't making much of a dent for most schools the growers pot tax has contributed about forty million a year into a building fund that district can only access if they can match the funding that means going to voters\nCompare that to the amount Kristen Hoffman's district just one district needs for school repairs a half a billion dollars and the amount schools across the state estimates they need to fix their building that is fourteen billion dollars that what the case you missed that fourteen billion\nDollars a new school cost about twenty five million dollars so I just told you that the fund is about forty dating\nMaybe the marijuana tax would help pay for a couple of new school year across the state now this isn't to say ... isn't getting any pop money remember the ... retail tax that pays for substance abuse and drop out programs things like that it's ... ... total amount\nAnd just go has received two million dollars since the marijuana funding began this is less than point three percentage ya ... general fund annual budget point three percent\nHas it been reporting on this story it strikes me how people think this really thriving industry marijuana must be contributing scads of money it's hard to grasp how little money comes into school for ... so that could ... your favorite pot shops\nWe have to round objects here I'm trying to experiment with him so we can visualize it so this is a chocolate chip cookie and it's delicious the further away and you eat this cooking yeah sure I'm a little against the carbohydrate thing but I Will I'm winning room\nLiving on the edge slots my knife along the way which is a little concerned I Do have a pocket knife in my backpack I have to imagine the cookie as the entire kindergarten through twelfth grade public school budget and we're going to cut us life to represent how much of the budget comes from marijuana taxes\nThe severe slice cookie set is one point six percent there there was one point six percent of the total\nThe flight the budget pie from marijuana taxes is like the width of a number to pencil one point six percent\nSo does that surprise you yes I I Do think that the surprising part which is completely understood is that I as a\nUser a regular user of marijuana and just seeing with my own eyes made the assumption it sounds like the incorrect assumption feet inflated assumption that the\n... in fact if you took all pot taxes the slice it makes up the entire state budget not just schools is the width of a stick of spaghetti point seven eight percent let's be clear school are happy with whatever they can get from pot taxes\nBut it doesn't fund with schools they they really need money for enough money to increase teacher salaries lower class sizes pay for mental health supports and by updated textbooks\nSo that's why you'll continue to see schools seeking money like measure amendment Seventy three that voters will see on the

Administration\nI'm overnight a boat for the most part they are just kind of try to band together and going for than trying to find places to stay\nNow we've seen these caravans before earlier this year in fact but why is this one this large is it spontaneous or they're you know people behind the scenes are organizing this\nOh I think it's a bit of both to definitely start out these these curve as they've done this for years a court ragweed because\nWhen you're making that long Journey Through Central America it can be an incredibly dangerous thing to do um do you get attacked by people along the way I'm I've talked to so many of these migrants who've been through these who told me horror stories of rapes of assaults of robberies and so this\nThese caravan several years ago as a way to protect themselves [noise] um so it was planned to a degree but the size of this is definitely been a bit more spontaneous because um they see the reports of it they say hey this was my chance and they'll run over and then joined the group\nNow President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on countries like Mexico to do something about this to stop them as they move north clearly government officials from Mexico haven't been able to do that yet have they been trying\n[noise] there's there's been different\nLevels of effort let's say I'm the Central American nations Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador um they tried to kind of slow them down a little bit but Mexico now all the focus goes to them down\nSo right now Mexico's in a very difficult position they're getting a lot of heat from the people with in Mexico and Central America to allow these folks to pass\nBut at the same time when you have President Trump\nI'm kind of hovering over you making these threats threatening to send the military to the border threatening to seal the U.S border which would be economically disastrous for Mexico it's a really tough position for them and they're trying to walk that line\nAnd it does seem like President Trump is trying to in a way use this to his advantage he's telling his Twitter followers that there are criminals and unknown middle Easterners mixed into this group and of course we don't really know if there's any basis in fact for a claim like that\nBut do you think Democrats should be nervous about this caravan heading north just about two weeks before the election when the president is trying to use it to fire up his base\nWhen you look at the political aspect of it is yes this is\nThis group really the timing of it has been a difficult because it's injected this issue so quickly into the midterms I'm President Trump has not been shy at all he's talking about it all the time Republicans like I can tell you I've been hearing from\nWatching the races are in in the middle of America They're talking about the Honduran caravan um\nThere are accusations that democratic operatives that George Soros was behind all this that they're paying for these for these caravan people but [noise] you know I've also talked to some folks who say actually this is it might as well have been paid for by the Republican Party because the idea of showing these images of these folks marching\nTowards the United states as they put it in trying to invade the United states\nBeen on a constant loop on all sorts of conservative media um it's being used in you know just congressional district debates all over the country in the last few weeks um and so this is something that plays into their hands\nThat said Allen how do you see this playing out if and when thousands of people do arrive at the U.S Mexico border\nWell we'll see a lot of what's been going on where they'll try to get in it and then it becomes a question of how quickly the U.S can processors asylum claims um and
