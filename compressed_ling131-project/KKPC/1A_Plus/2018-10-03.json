finances how here's wired much of his money from his father and how his wealth change\nThere are times reports Trump's father funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in various ways to avoid some

girl's\nNine years [noise] and the news cast is coming up next\nLine from NPR News in Washington I'm core of a Coleman President Trump is being criticized for mocking the woman who was alleged Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins who is not decided whether to support Kavanaugh's nomination said Trump was quote just plain wrong when he made fun of Christine Blasey Ford at a political rally in Mississippi last night the crowd laughed and clapped\nNPR's Kelsey Snell says GOP leaders are seeking Collins support\nRepublican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they are trying to deal\nThe president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he had a personal connection with allegations that and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of that\nNPR's Kelsey Snell in Indonesia time is running out for earthquake and tsunami victims still buried under rebel Indonesian disaster officials have increased the death toll to more than fourteen hundred people Michael Sullivan reports on the rescue efforts\nA spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said in Jakarta that rescue workers have reached all four of the worst affected areas but he declined to give an estimate on casualties three of the areas had been largely cut off since Friday by roads damaged by the earthquake landslides and down bridges\nOfficials say heavy equipment to clear the rubble are still in short supply\nAnd increasingly desperate survivors are still waiting for food and water and medical supplies\nMany still sleeping outside five days after the quake most of the dead reported so far were found in the city of ... where nearly a dozen military flights carrying relief supplies landed Wednesday morning for NPR News I'm Michael Sullivan in the non Vietnam\nTests done by the state of North Carolina show no environmental hazards in the Neuse River this after Hurricane Florence and breached coal ash ponds operated buying Duke Energy Jason to ruin of member station WBUR UNC says that contradicts claims made by an environmental group\nThe department of environmental quality says their tests on the Neuse River showed new elevated levels of dangerous metals in the water\nWhile those results came as a relief to Duke Energy they are in direct conflict with tests taken by the water keeper alliance the environmental advocacy group says the tests were done too late by the time regulators took samples and she'd been diluted\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they were black robes and they sit behind\nA left turns that literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion but he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or do you remember during our thing\nWhat is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand\nIt some basic level the defense that if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something\nOf course you're going to have passion about it but his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era we are not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nAh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from ... in the courtroom the judge would be shocked\nUm so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if our Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats whether you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would file a motion to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I that I Do know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court involving him right\nDo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\n... she'll be American Constitution society thanks so much\nAnd get a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who want to bring
