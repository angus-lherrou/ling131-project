{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "One of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was huge distinguishing between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind the differences in your mind\nBlack people okay [laughter] [laughter] than black people um\nI think it's also the difference between a him an integral spiritual okay you know you're going to saying the same song but even if if you are doing a note like oh and then you have some like ...\n... those\nOther notes that are being song or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from\nSo that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say a sustained on it but it's a stay on it you know you're putting that heart and it is coming from some place deep in your soul\nThat you are getting out and and just wanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's when they grow spiritual [noise] well speaking of\nOf pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the south or for the book and then one of the stops you made was a mother Emanuel one of\nThe oldest black congregation from the south it was the churches hundred Ninety nice birthday but this was also as so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on worshipers just over three years ago in interest in men's tragedy for for a whole country what what was that experience like\nWe had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um we decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina and they were having a celebration\nAnd it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way [laughter]\nWay because you're like a ... of the famous celebrity chef that right now I she didn't care but the matrix that kids so it was like I'm trying to get this re past food done and\nYou all are in the way um but they had\nAll of these pots going in and then just this huge kitchen and there's a hierarchy that happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting this food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a tasks\nTo other people and it is serious\nIt was really beautiful and it was it was about the congregation coming together and there was a tragedy but there was also you knew that they had each other and that anybody who came into that church that day was part of that family and it was just a beautiful thing one\nMore recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about some hot water corn bread so this is not your average cornbread Carla this is something different right\nIt is not your average cornbread if you're not from the south okay [laughter]\nPeople on a cell phone or exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly have much of corn bread and loved it but hot water or vote of having a sort of what what what what what would I be doing that for tried to make this\nHot water corn bread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder\nAnd the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember my grandmother's fingers being in those patio so she would make little over one is my mother makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it in that\nBut it I mean seriously it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot of the\nThe larger things that you were learning about yourself through this\nI must say that this was a personal journey with this book\nI set out to tell this story so that African Americans could appreciate the food more and people outside of the community can understand what it is and\nAnd sort of maybe be inspired to not only cook the food but also to look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines\nMore I realize I was carrying a a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and what it is but I had a chip on my shoulder into it come out sideways and ... and you know\nUh and now it is just a love for this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines ... love talking to your thank you for for coming back on and best of luck with the book thank you so much justice in such a pleasure [noise]\nThe book\nIs called Carla

I mean there could be there a local regulation of that restrict that but um you know there would be minimal impact\nNow onto maybe some economic analysis this listener question\nOh ... gill and I'd like to see a comparison to that all the oil and gas industry Christians to Colorado's overall on what was your size compared to other industries\nSo one way to look at this is to examine what percentage the industry is of Colorado's overall gross domestic product so\nI'm I looked at a couple of different years twenty fourteen was kind of the peak of the oil and gas boom in Colorado in the industry accounted for about seven percent of the state's GDP than seven percent at the height they're less right\nTwenty sixteen was a low point for the industry was about three percent and twenty Eighteen I'm you know you see about five percent so when you look at the average over ten years for oil and gas extraction um you know it's really a doesn't really fit into the top ten industries for GDP which\nIs really led by things like real estate IT Services manufacturing healthcare\nOkay there comes a surprise to me what about jobs though does the raking change when you start to look at look at me ploy Mitt associated with only\nAlso not really not seeing stuff in the top ten so state wide more than twenty nine twenty nine thousand people are directly employed by oil and gas companies that's about one percent of the state's overall workforce\nThe data though does not track support services connected to the industry so\nUm you know it's not capturing the number is maybe truck drivers who are driving water to oil and gas drilling sites you know what one thing I Will point out here though is that the impact of proposition one twelve if it's passed would really be acutely felt in a place like weld county 'cause that's where a lot of oil and gas workers live right\nNow because of the impact it might be uneven across the sale more concentrated in some communities are here's another listener question on the numbers\nHi this is any race from Louis so I Wonder how much or what percentage of the state's overall budget comes from taxes on oil and gas\nSo statewide taxes are those are something called a severance tax that the oil and gas industry ... pays\n'em you know look at between about twenty twelve twenty Seventeen the range was pretty wide between four million dollars and two hundred and sixty five million dollars\nUm that's less it sounds like a lot it's less than one percent of the state budget a and actually the the amount of severance tax that's paid is very small when you compare Colorado to say Alaska where several taxes make up more than fifty percent of you know the coffers there\nI'm surprised by the range of severance tax is from year to year I guess that shows just how much the industry is prone to booms and busts\nAnd it's all based off of the price of oil as you may a match and you know one thing I really also want to point out is that um oil and gas companies also pay property taxes local governments to weld county is bringing tens of millions of dollars in property taxes that are based off of wealth and that's been a significant support\nThey're speaking again to this idea that some places might be more disproportionately affected than others if prop one twelve were to pass Grace Hood when you've been talking with voters have you gotten any sense of ... from them that they might vote for this proposition because of concerns about climate change\nGreat question so I was out in Loveland and was canvassing for several hours mirroring a kind of shadowing the Colorado rising group was inspired mental group that's been supportive as you are following the Kansas or I was following the canvassers and I have to say I mean I did not hear a single voter bring that up as a priority\nI understand that some environmental advocates are really bringing that up as a point but my sense is it's sort of more of an intellectual point for a groups then something that might be top of mind for the majority of\nOkay on a similar seem so advocates are touting cleaner air safer condition\nSales force essential that sales force dot com flash essentials\nSupport comes from peak ear nose throat and voice center offering balloons sign up lasting a minimally and they said the office procedure for sinus infections with locations in Brookfield golden and brightened P.

Vita healthcare corporation of America\nOr what exactly is it that you provide because it it strikes me that any company could just go to college or university and say let's strike a deal you're a middle woman here\nGood and you know a bit of what we do is akin to a health care benefits if you think of the way Kaiser works know geysers and integrated model that manages the whole health insurance for a company like ours we use ... but they also connect us to a network of doctors\nGuild does the same thing for a company so we administer all of the complexities of offering an education benefit and there are a lot of a tax components did as to make sure that it's tax efficient for the company and a lot of details\nAfter you managed to help the student ideally be debt free when they graduate and we managed that\nAnd then we also connect the schools at this network of universities to the employer and and as you said yes the company could go strike a deal with one school and you see that happen sometimes but managing dozens or hundreds of those relationships tend not to be the core competency of a corporate HR team\n... ... not necessarily connecting with institutions of higher education no you are conducting a companies with bricks and mortar a higher ed but also online higher ed what exactly are the workers getting out of this I'm\nJoe you know talk about that in the tangible and then the intangibles what they're getting is a tends to be either up Ninety two hundred percent of their tuition paid for my goodness at a number of schools within our network of schools\nAnd that also includes coaching and advising which we provide so what we found is that many low and middle wage workers who haven't gone to college before often their parents didn't go to college there first in their family maybe they don't have a lot of friends who have\nAnd they really need support navigating the whole process so we have a team of coaches and advisors who help every student figure out where do I want to go to school what program is aligned with the things I'm excited about in my career and moving either up within my company or beyond\nAnd then a coach to work with you throughout your whole degree program to help you figure out how to succeed in college\nIs this very expensive for companies like what is the cost benefit analysis the executives have to do before the sort of jump into higher at as a benefit for their employees\nSo foreign to our lives pretty fantastic so most of our company see a return on investment around a hundred and thirty percent to two hundred and ten percent\nMeaning for every dollar they invest here they see a dollar thirty to two dollars ten come back into their corporate pockets how in the form of recruitment benefits is a lot of our company see their um job application rates go up by twenty to thirty percent when they announced a program like this\nBecause of program like this is a magnet that's borne out\nYet and then the short term retention benefit so right now a lot of the companies we work with the six to twelve months typical turnover meaning the employees only there for six to twelve months with us and this can extend it to three or four years so when you can hire one great employee once for four years versus hire eight employees over that four year span you read a lot of savings\nSay more about the kind of worker who takes advantage of it is better for\nSure that they tend to be high potential employees um typically only three to five percent of an employee base will use a benefit like this in any given year so it's not mass um but it's the employees who have been wanting to go to college but haven't been able to figure out how to navigate it either the cost\nThat time management or the things that have held them back from going back to school prior\nUses that they don't have their undergrad degrees at all mostly\nTypically yeah so we are mission that killed is to work with the sixty four million Americans who haven't yet had a chance to either earn a bachelor's degree or a meaningful higher ed credential\nNow what is in it for the colleges and universities because they have to be at the table for this\nDeal right yeah so um you know of the American workforce there's about a hundred and sixty million Americans who work sixty four million of them haven't completed college and about thirty million of them work at the fortune one thousand and so we're helping connect universities who want to meet those thirty million of its about half of their address a bowl population\nSit in the fortune one thousand and two we help the university's meet them\nAnd and what that does is dramatically reduced the university's marketing costs and\nAnd this isn't well known but marketing and advertising costs or the the big devil of higher ed right now so the for profit schools the University of Phoenix says they spend four to six thousand dollars to acquire a student and the nonprofit schools we work with can't afford that\nAnd so what we do is we prevent them from having to spend four to six thousand dollars on Google and Facebook ads to find a student and instead meat that student directly through their company\nAnd these are students that otherwise wouldn't necessarily be within their reach and vice versa not necessarily potential students who would've known themselves to reach out to a college or university\nOkay I'm I'm fascinated by this how the heck do you make money that's always a question induced ruptures is you know when entrepreneur is\nFind some niche how does it keep you afloat\nGreat question so we capture the savings that the universities would have otherwise spent on Google and Facebook ads they passed some of that marketing and advertising savings on to go to cover all the services we offered that they're older she's encountered by wishing you are but yep yep\nSo they're both paying you and they're discounting tuition and do you say is a benefit to the institutions of higher education\nAnd not because of the the crazy marketing and advertising market of higher ed today Google the number one buyer and twenty fourteen was higher education\n... I also think that a lot of people are an easy with the idea of nonprofit institutions and you work with him exclusively spending a lot of money on advertising you know\nYeah it's somewhat sideways but it's a hard ... it's a hard thing to figure out because how else should they attract students and otherwise the for profit schools are the only ones that low income Americans have ever heard of do\nYou think we will see more companies offering higher education as a benefit\nYes we see it as a growing trend and uh the last year has only reinforced that pretty dramatically\nJust briefly I Want to know that you started this company guild education in San Francisco and then moved to Denver and just a few seconds what prompted you to move\nA couple of things talent market culture because we're ... and we wanted a double bottom line and I grew up\nHere and you grow up here and cost maybe a little bit yes yeah although the divide between San Francisco in Denver is less than it used to be a regional thanks for being with us fascinating stuff thank you Rachel Carlson CEO of Denver based guild education\nHer company helps employers including ...

what is the political significance of linking Hong Kong with it's almost like a biblical cord to the mainland\nThat's exactly how one lawmaker air quality a moat described it to me today and when you're flying in the wrong you see this long bridge and it's really it's striking site just one month ago today they opened up a high speed rail line connecting Hong Kong to Guam Joe China\nStep by step people here feel like Beijing is physically putting its stamp on this shooting\n... twenty billion dollars a decade to build a but the government is of course is making the argument that there is an economic boost to be out here is that true\nExpecting an influx in mainland Chinese tourists to you know on those buses that are going to be allowed to travel on the British and certainly not private cars Hong Kong already has a pretty nasty tourism industry fifty six million tourists a per year which is about twenty million\nFor them to UK which is much larger country\nSo the retail sector or the service industry could benefit\nBut at what cost to the city itself to things like traffic to the citizens in air quality of life if people already are concerned that when you walk down the sidewalk it's so crowded primarily with mainland tourists that it's difficult to get around some of the more populated areas and the city the lions at\nTourist attraction like that the trend that goes up to the peak which gives you an overview of the city that is always you know multiple hours especially during you know busy times of the day so people are fearful to those kinds of things are gonna get worse for the people actually living in Hong Kong it's more visitors flock here\nHow much does this bolster president she's image we've been reporting so much about China's efforts to undertake these huge infrastructure projects in places like the south China Sea military infrastructure projects or is this a part of that in a way\nI mean China prides itself in completing these massive project and yet those those artificial islands in the south China Sea obviously controversial but that's trying to putting its stamp on territory that explains even though those claims are rejected by the United states and many countries in here in the region and around the world as far as you know others you know civilian type infrastructure\n... this is now the sixth largest bridge in the world the one that is opening your own cause I\nGuess where the other five largest bridges are they're all located in China and it just goes to show that you know China wants to prove to the world that it can get things done and the British itself is it really is a wonder of engineering they have four and a half times the skill San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge to artificial islands in under the title\nI you know even though it took nine years to build and and you know there were considerable delayed it is it absolutely breathtaking site to look at it to look at it breaks down a clear day goes as far as I can say wow and were you on it\nWe've been on it or we haven't been able to cross over to the Chinese side as a journalist it's actually very difficult for me to go into China without a very extensive visa process but for people who live in Hong Kong\nYou'll be able to buy a ticket got on a bus and for significantly less money than what they have a right now there'll be able to travel much more quickly and efficiently but for Hong Congress we like to maintain their sense of semi independent said don't want even more Chinese and was than what they're already is a well obviously they're concerned you know one lawmaker told me today that\nEven though twenty forty seven it's supposed to be the deadline that China allows Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist system in way of life without interference she feels and many other steal that this bridge has moved up that twenty four seven day by maybe a decade or two ... which means that for people growing up here in Hong Kong the message is being said very clearly they are part of the mainland\nAnd they have to always remember that it's the motherland with a capital M no negotiations no questions asked and certainly no protests\nCNN International correspondent will Ripley speaking with us from Hong Kong about the world's longest the crossing bridge that open today linking Hong Kong to mainland China

it's the first east coast city to get scooters from left but scooters are already widespread in the nation's capital with companies like bird lime and skip\nAlready offering rent a boat dock list electric scooters for short trips around the city jak Rudy and is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joins us now Jeff\nHi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately well we currently have upwards of two thousand\nWas in doc was vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around we launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate the technology here in Washington DC\nAbout a year ago and have people been happy with them so far are what are they saying well we've\nGotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be be on to use these as a part of their daily commuting experience and others who are using them for periodic trips\nTo go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute with a scooter what\nWe've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are short distances in some cases they are a longer connection a distance is getting to and from metro stations for example so there are a number of cases that we have observed or over the past year\nAnd one of the things that a lot of cities have said about the scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and the clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk if you get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front are you seeing that there\nThis is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidents of those things are decreasing\nAnd do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nA we have ah been working with them to collect data and information and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nAnd they are sharing information with you that's correct\nSo obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who was writing a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has\nDied in an accident in the U. S. on on one of these scooters what are you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that doesn't happen again at least to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again\nSure well D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place uh to eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries and we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously to work with\nFrom NPR and W.
