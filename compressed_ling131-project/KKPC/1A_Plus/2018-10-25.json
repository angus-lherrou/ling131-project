bombs two of the new packages were in Delaware at addressed a former vice president Joe Biden\nThe third was bought outside of a restaurant belonging to Robert De Niro in Detroit ... neighborhood of Manhattan New York police tell NPR that that one can tell you the potential explosive device similar to those discovered earlier this week\nThe FBI has warned that there may be more of these packages out there and has asked members of the public for any information that could help in the investigation Ryan Lucas NPR News Washington\nPresident Trump's delivering on his threat to send more troops to the southern us border with Mexico to keep a caravan of thousands have Central Americans from crossing illegally NPR's Tom Bowman has the latest\nThe department of homeland security has made a real close to the Pentagon to send hundreds of troops down to the border to help with the border patrol\nWe're told the defense secretary Jim Mattis ... signed that order today sending as many as eight hundred\nArmy troops down to the border we're told they're going to be military police and engineers again to assist border patrol not to take part in any sort of a law enforcement activities and we're told they're likely be active duty troops or Army Reserve troops\nAs NPR's Tom Bowman are reporting under law troops are only allowed to serve\nIn support capacity they are not permitted to get

to show the Denver Post had an interesting right up about this study to show that conservative turnout increases when their tax issues on the ballot\nSo these other issues may very well be influential on who turns out and of course how or who they vote for in the state Senate races or anything to add their center will just\nTypically in the mid term election as we've heard nationally the party of the president doesn't do as well and president Donald Trump didn't win in Colorado He's not extremely popular here\nYet at the same time our economy's doing really great and so Democrats are worried their voters won't won't turn out and I think that's a big concern Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was just in Colorado trying to mobilize younger voters and one of the Eighteen year olds I spoke with attended a rally\nAnd he said you know he's he's nervous that a good portion of younger voters or maybe disengaged after Trump got elected they feel their voices weren't hard and they're just not gonna bother and also some Democrats are just so focused on twenty twenty cars they dislike Trump so much they're forgetting about the mid term altogether\nI'm so for Democrats it's just going to be critical to get voters like disengaged especially if they hope to win control of the state Senate another woman I talked to was a little bit older her name's Catherine ... she also attended the Sanders rally she's retired she taught at CU Boulder she's from lung mine she's unaffiliated but she leans left\nWell the people I Know are are pretty angry at the way things are and are really

amendments Seventy four ask voters to beef up private property rights by compensating people if something government does reduces their property values\nThe primary proponents are farmers backed by big money from the oil and gas industry meanwhile state and local governments are virtually in a panic over its potential passage\nCPR is great so it takes a closer look\nThis year's drought has thrown the economic hammer down on farmer mark ...\nWe had one of the toughest we crops we've ever had in our history yet a lot of hail that came at the wrong time and basically cut our harvests about ten percent of what we would expect to about two hundred yards away at fruit cuts aluminum siding for a small shed Ernest fields around here\nThe face of it was a woman who wanted to build homes on her ex urban land outside Portland just briefly tell us how the measure was worded and what it did\nSure um measure thirty seven [noise] the the ballot title says government must pay\nOr forego enforcement when certain land use regulations reduce property value [noise] which is a pretty attractive premise and then the campaign for the measure featured Dorothy English\nNinety year old widow\nShe and her husband had bought property outside of Portland in the rural area I'm\nBack in the sixties and then discovered when it came time to divide and provide home sites for family members on that property that\nThey couldn't do that because it was now designated for farm and forestry\nAnd along with other people who found themselves in that situation they supported organizations like Oregonians that action that one of the get rid of land use ... and the un successfully campaigned to repeal Oregon's like he was planning to a successful elections in the seventies and one in the eighties\nAnd then under took a long term effort to advocate for property rights over\nA natural resource and farmland protection\nAnd so thirty seven comes about and as you described it it really gave landowners property owners to avenues one they could be compensated by government if something government did affected the the value\nWhat's more one theory is that it started just over the Colorado State law and talked to Rachel early he is Colorado State epidemiologist she's going to share this history with us welcome back to the\nProgram and were\nPleased to have you on the show why did the flu season of Nineteen Eighteen become a global pandemic\nSo suddenly one of the factors that resulted in global transmission of this virus was it was really the time the era and this was in the middle of World War one and so there was a lot of movement of troops that was really for the unprecedented for the time that really resulted in transmission across the globe of this virus\nOkay and that kind of movement is probably ... unlike anything the world it's seen to that point that's correct okay uh well what made it spread so quickly beyond that\nYeah so this was and you know any kind of an influenza that pandemic it it means that there's a new influenza virus\nThat individual if you're not really have an existing immune response to and so because of that people are highly susceptible to that infection and it can easily spread from person to person it also means intentionally that people can have much more city our outcomes because their immune system has not seen that diverse ... previously\nIt can really result in much greater rates of hospitalization or even mortality\nUh was Nineteen Eighteen the the worst pandemic put it into some context for us\nIt is so it is known as a matter of ...\nAnd so it is it certainly was I think the really the largest pandemic to this day that um the globe has experience so as you mentioned tens of millions of deaths occurred worldwide including deaths of course here in Colorado\nHow does it compare to the ...\nSo the black death I did have higher mortality rates but it was much more confined\nGoing back to that idea that because of all of this troop movement um there were really cases that occurred across the globe\nSo as we were researching this topic we found that this pandemic really hits home for people we were discussing it around our editorial meeting and my colleague Andrea Dukakis recalls the effect on her family\nMy father's side of the family were Greek immigrants and\nI'd always heard about the Nineteen Eighteen flu epidemic because shortly after they arrived in the U.S\nThe epidemic hit and um everyone was sick in the family my great grandfather died so did the oldest brother in the family\nUm and I heard stories about carts being driven around towns and picking up dead bodies everyone was just terrified of getting sec what accounts have you heard\n[noise] yeah so there are lots of different stories that that occurred to come out of Colorado history books I'm so one um one particular community that was very hard hit was silver in Colorado I'm so silver tend obviously had a large mining population\nAnd during the Nineteen Eighteen pandemic it was really that population of twenty to forty year old that were hardest hit I think it was a large percentage of the silver ten community the mining community\nAnd and during the pandemic their stories of\nOf you know hundreds of deaths occurring in silver ten I'm In one night alone ten deaths occuring um the city hall was converted to a makeshift hospital to how those people they didn't have\nEnough resources to deal with the body's I'm also stories about not having sufficient medical care there please and the city\nI'm really to have medical personnel sent to the town to to help says\nDid you find that there were big differences in how the flu hit different communities in Colorado and how they responded\nAbsolutely so Gunnison is is a community that was really known as an escape community at the time so gun is and I think very differently from silver ten and other communities in Colorado\nI'm very early honest established some very strict quarantine requirements so they put up barricades to the city they did not allow cars to pass through they stopped trains anyone that want it to get off and gone and had to go into a force quarantine for several days\nOn close schools very early lots of strict measures in place that that did ultimately protect the town of ...\nActually works that it wasn't just a sort of fear mongering step\nNo absolutely well I I Would say that there certainly was the year ... there were a neighboring community that we're ... we're seeing very high mortality rates and very high um attack rates lots of cases occurring and neighboring communities and so I think Jonathan was very proactive\nWith your one theory is that the Nineteen Eighteen flu originated just over the Colorado border in Kansas\nAnd as we've been spread with the movement of us soldiers in World War one uh I don't know you'd think it would have appeared in the coastal states you know maybe brought in by trends is you know the trouble ... what's ... Kansas theory\nYou know so the Kansas theory um so so the the pandemic occurred in several waves largest wave you mentioned was the second wave the fall of Nineteen Eighteen but earlier in the spring including as early as of January there were documented cases cases that were reported to the federal government\nThat occurred in the town of Haspel Kansas that were these severe influenza are pneumonia type cases that were very unusual to the the medical providers outlet and that was taken care of these patients\nAnd then we also know that individuals from that community then later on moved to Fort Fort ... know Fort uh can't remember the name of it forward to near Manhattan, Kansas okay I'm a military training facility where um\nWhere a large outbreak occurred in the spring and so going back to hassle Kansas one of the reasons that hassle Kansas has been targeted is not only did those early cases appear but\nHaskell and that area of the country are really part of a large migratory flight away and we do know that um there's lots of belief there's lots of research that found that this virus really as of avian origin and so we believe that perhaps this came out of wild birds then within domesticated birds and then transmitted to humans\nAre that's fascinating ah might just be Fort Riley I think it was camp funds and Jerry ... still life recall fury if we do to help you out [noise]\nAh what kinds of responses to juicy in Colorado that that made no sense [noise] um because I have to think that there were folks taking steps that maybe weren't really helpful\nSo lots of interesting things on the bats were promoted there were recommendations to not eat meat there were um all sorts of sad and creams and lotions and things that you can imagine certainly um lots of fresh air with recommended a but a lot of the social distancing measures those measures that are put in place\nI'm really to prevent transmission were also haphazardly applied so things like\nI'm On street cars the the windows were required to be open but people complained and so then they closed every other window and things like requiring people to wear masks and certain settings but not other settings\nClosing churches and theaters but perhaps not closing other types of businesses so some of those measures were applied not universally and and I think to this day our understanding of a social distancing measures that they certainly can work but they do need to be applied consistently\nNo I think of Colorado in this year uh so we're talking about Nineteen Eighteen we're looking back a hundred years to the global flu pandemic but I think of Colorado in that era as being a destination for people with tuberculosis your idea was that the the air here was good for your lungs\nA wouldn't have been more vulnerable to flu\nYes I think we we certainly know to this day that individuals with chronic medical conditions including respiratory conditions are at increased risk for severe outcomes due to influence so absolutely that population would have been a greater risk\nOr anything we've learned from Nineteen Eighteen that's still valuable\nYou know so I think we've um we've learned a lot about\nImmune response to to viruses and how novel virus has really can impact um populations you know there's been lots of work done to reconstruct this virus and trying to study the very on factors I guess he did with the virus one question\nIs could it happen again right that has to be in scientists mines\nYeah certainly I think we are always vulnerable to pandemics I think one of the one of the you know very I think helpful things they have now is antibiotics a lot of the cases that occurred in Nineteen Eighteen were\n... caught that influenza virus secondary bacterial in pneumonia and so we now have antibiotics to treat those individuals we also of course have vaccine and anti viral medications\nSome lots of things now that I'm I think would I think decrease the transmission of fire\nSo it's the secondary things that people died from not necessarily the initial flu infection and what have people learn by studying the Nineteen Eighteen flew him even I'm perplexed as to how you do that\nYeah so there was interesting reconstruction of this virus really trying to isolate on DNA segments from individuals that had previously died of the Nineteen Eighteen fluent out of tissue assessments they're able to reconstruct this virus and and learn about how this virus you know differently than other influenza viruses really did have\nA strong affinity for the lower respiratory tract so really dead cause lower respiratory tract or a pneumonia type symptoms and people perhaps more so than other types of influence have the ability to do and then there's also interesting um studies that have been trying to look at why certain age groups between twenty and forty were particularly vulnerable to the flu\nOr which you've you've you've hinted at in this conversation\nYes yeah so so really we think that that population of twenty to forty year old\nHad during the early childhood experience to a different type of influenza virus and that really influenced um their immune response to the Nineteen Eighteen virus and really resulted in them having an ineffective R D is regulated immune response and made them particularly vulnerable than to secondary lecture ammonia\nThis is not the first time it's happened that story is that someone is dumped in a bunch of fish presumably jumps to catch them and Crockett says it's not uncommon elsewhere in Colorado\nWe have a good fifty or so documented instances of illegal stocking around the state and of course this is a way underestimate because those are the only ones that come to our attention basic biology tells you that\nThere have been many more attempts that haven't succeeded to where the fish have an established themselves as a population so they never come to our attention\nYou want to think of a fishing people as you know kind of conscientious conservationists and yet you had this example of at least a handful of people because they want to catch a certain kind of fish or dumped those fish in a reservoir where they don't belong\nI'm sure that it is a handful of people I Would bet you that Ninety nine plus percent of our anglers are people who would never consider doing something like this but a small minority can cause a lot of damage for us what kind of damage\nI'm being the case of past story is as we've seen in the past once you get when you put a top level predators\nLike that into a body of water that doesn't have one is those fish are going to go like gangbusters for awhile and seemed to be doing well because they are eating all the fish that all the prey base but once said prey base is gone then I'm\nYou're going to end up with a large number of stunted skinny fish egg lawyers call and hammer handles um northern pike are very susceptible to this says are a lot of other species\nSo you will eventually end up with a fishery that nobody wants to fish at\nDo you know how someone carries out this illegal stocking do you just like drive up with a big tank or fish or go out on the boat or something or what\n[laughter] I'm One part of the problem is that it's pretty easy to do and pretty hard to get caught at you know fish can be moved in\nTanks they can be moved and bode well they can be moved short distances you know just in a bucket if you put your mind to it it's not terribly hard to keep the fish alive for a few hours and transport it from one place to another\nAnd you can drop a relatively small number of these northern pike for example into the reservoir and then before long there's a much greater number\n[noise] um let me think about this because I don't want to be necessarily giving people a cookbook for how to do\nThis [laughter] that's definitely true you know if the fish they get moved are adults and their of reproductive age and they happened to get stock into a place where they can survive then uh it doesn't take many fish to get a population started\nJust as they try to convince people who fish that this is a bad idea to kind of take ecosystems into your own hands this way\nWe definitely do we have information about that on the back of our fishing pressure at the counter when you buy a life is on our website information that our law enforcement personnel handout I'm so we try and a lot of ways to get the word out\nAnd of course there are substantial penalties if you happen to get caught and we can make a case against you you can be fined up\nTo ten thousand dollars there's possibility that you can do jail time you can be responsible for the cost of remediation um but you would also hope that people would just want to do the right thing\nCPR is Mike ... talking with Harry Crockett a biologist with Colorado parks and wildlife about the problem if people putting fish illegally and to stay waterways\nFinally today the Denver modern dance company wonder about is premiering we had to buy you it follows childhood friends from different backgrounds as they deal with the aftermath of
