that President Trump had requested Turkey's audio evidence but he said it has not been shared\nPeter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWith a Trump Administration facing more backlash over its tempered response so far to the Washington Post columnist suspected murder\nThe president is also drawing condemnation for apparently condoning the behavior of the Montana congressmen who was charged with assaulting reporter last year at a campaign rally last night for Republican Greg gene forte people laugh when Trump brought up the attack\n'cause I had heard that he body slams a reporter [noise]\nAnd it was way up\nAnd he was way up and I said oh this was like\nOh the election or just before\nAnd I said oh this is terrible you said it was the elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help him\nJean forte is up for re election in November the top us commander in Afghanistan says he was not the target of a Taliban attack in southern Afghanistan yesterday that killed two senior security officials Jennifer glass reports from Kabul that a Taliban infiltrators opened fire in the Kandahar governor's compound\nThe Taliban said us and NATO general Scott Miller was a main targeted the attack along with Afghan provincial police commander on the ... who was killed\nMiller says well it may have been a close confined space he believes the attack was on Afghan security forces that he was not the target the killing of ... and the provincial head of intelligence has left a security vacuum in Afghanistan south\nAnd twenty five other projects around the stadium and we heard that you know we heard oh can't be done\nThe difference back then when Bill Owens pushed it and voters approved was the money was actually coming out of the budget with fixture dam road prop one oh nine that money is coming from the surplus money that's coming in people might not realize and they will at the end of year when they do their taxes\nThat the Trump tax code actually means a tax increase for most people's state income tax\nAnd in fact will be bringing in almost nine hundred million dollars more a year according to the state government and you think that should be tapped for roads and some of it should in when you see how much we starve roads over the last Twenty years we need to re prioritize when when\nI look at both prop one oh nine and one ten another difference I see is just the amount of money that would be generated a what do you say John Caldera to those who complained that that one oh nine is just a drop in the bucket\nIt's not a drop in the bucket it is a serious amount of money to jumpstart the most critical projects it'd be really clear concede this is not a silver bullet\nOr nor is it a a unicorn bullets are like twenty or one ten unicorns bullet I always have never heard of that I sort of everything I was gonna say Christmas tree was\nIt is a doable amount my sense is that people are not ready for a statewide tax increase they're usually not they usually go down very strongly so what is it that we can get done an immediately and that's where one oh nine is all\nRight and on one ten Kelly rough to this idea of the sales tax increase you are hearing from mayor is like the mayor in Colorado Springs he says listen we've already passed some local taxes to address our own local transportation needs\nAlong comes to the states perhaps with its own tax increase and the burden is just going up too high in our specific community would you address that concern for us\nYeah you have two huge issues first rural Colorado local communities there are not going to be able to on their own solve their transportation needs and why would we in the metro area care about that is because we have a workforce who cares about getting around the state it's part of the quality of life we sell here\nAnd if you're going to fix the system you have to fix it not city by city and hope everybody comes up with their contribution but you have to fix both the state system\nAnd the local system do you have any concerns that the tax rate is getting too high and some Colorado communities so our tax rate when you combine both state and local is still very competitive or in the country\nUm and so we don't have concerns about at our greater concern is our failure to invest\nIs impacting us greatly a study was done Ryan that shows each of us today is paint over two thousand dollars a year in use using more gas cars were sitting in traffic damage to our vehicles because of the condition of our roads more accidents\nTwo thousand dollars a year you talked about impacting working families this small increase in sales tax will help reduce that cost chunk out there are there's\nNursing first what he said that at a Twenty one percent jump in our state sales tax is a small amount it is a serious investment\nI I I haven't done the math on the fly is that right twenty now and that\nIs wrong what you're paying sales tax this'll be roughly about seven or eight percent what you're paying sales tax\nTotal heart current sales tax is two point five percent on the state level besides another point six to that as an increase of Twenty one percent\nIn any way you cut it it means that places like Boulder and Longmont superior will be paying nine percent\nOf the same thing down in Colorado Springs which is why mayor is like the one in Jamestown and all over say wait a second this could hurt our ability locally if we want to raise more taxes were local mobility local projects for seniors\nLocal safety projects and by the way let me I I Want to consider a couple of things we both agree not enough money going into into transferred yes that's right and I also agree or something that Kelly said often is that there's a problem with our way we tax what we do right now we do mostly on the gas tax\nAnd uh as our cars become more efficient that means we're not getting as much back so we're ...\nYears since the gas tax or an ... let me just say that you're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and it's part of our mid term election coverage we are debating a politely discussing\nUh towards one oh nine fix our damn roads of those who are decided there are many undecided we should say on this topic\nCan we talk through just briefly like I'm ... ... voter confusion or perhaps even voter generosity like the idea that one of these might pass both of these might pass neither of these might pass a I mean in many ways you have ... measures here John\nI think it's more likely that neither would pass than both would pass it both words pass been terrific we've got lots of funding for lots of things\nI have a feeling one or the other will pass and given the history of tax increases statewide and polling not only from I'm not away from\nThat we've done but also polling that groups like the Denver chamber of done with parents group we've seen that this was not a very popular proposal but we'll find out on election day and we can vote either way I'll give you the last word\nCan we ... we have done a lot of pulling in research on our initiative prop one ten is built around what voters value local control money coming into their communities and identified list of priorities Twenty years it goes away the biggest projects that improved their quality of life and voters have consistently told us they like this and support it\nThanks for being with us both of you thank you Kelly rough president of the Denver metro chamber of commerce she heads a coalition in favor of prop one ten\nTo raise the state sales tax for transportation John ... heads the libertarian independence Institute he supports proposition one oh nine otherwise known as fix our damn roads it would raise three and a half billion dollars in bonds and repay them with existing state funds\nThey are to the community so I put up this a little schoolhouse one room schoolhouse that a\nA kind of mimic to where she taught as a as a teacher that she was a teacher yeah and then I put in books that she'd that you'd had over the years that she passed back and forth of family and I felt it was kind of a gift to the community to celebrate that spirit of who my mother was ...\nSo in some ways do you see each little free library as a version of your mother continuing dancing dancing\nAbsolutely um ice each library's like one of my kids and I see each one of them is a dance of my mother around the planet you call people who put up little free libraries stewards\nAnd are there more than five hundred of them in metro Denver I guess making it one of the most active regions in the country absolutely Denver's been absolutely wonderful ah they embrace it as art they've in braces community [noise]\nThey've been raised to as a ways of giving back to the community social justice they've done all kinds of things and I've watched him for years\nAnd we've been absolutely impressed what happens and we know that the five hundred you have today in a couple of years will be a thousand so we we feel that it's becoming a part of the fabric of Denver and that is really exciting to us\nA thought crossed my mind is I was walking through the neighborhood that the people who live there likely had no problem accessing books you know there's the public library\nOr where I was walking they were probably well heeled enough to buy a book if they needed one like what what role do these play what do you see is the the mission of little free libraries\nWill uh I Believe one that everybody has a right to read and then everybody should read and and our long term goal isn't twenty thirty five that we write a book that's entitled we all read weld together the history of the grassroots literacy movement\nAnd what we do is write a chapter every year in Denver is a big part of that chapter and the idea is that we don't have enough resources really to you know make the difference we need to make totally so neighborhoods step up and help educate and help with literacy of their own community\nAnd do you find that these little free libraries appear in all kinds of neighborhoods are in more upper middle class ones like what what do you know as you look at their distribution\nI'm ... about eighty five percent women women mothers are the key drivers of little free library\nAnd what happens is they listen to it on a public radio station like this or read it in the newspaper in upper class higher social economic neighborhoods start and then what happens is it starts to work its way through the community starts in ending up at the apartment the trailer on you know the schools\nAnd so what happens is starts out more social economic higher levels and then it works its way throughout the community to all levels and you've seen that in communities around the world I guess Detroit Cleveland Minneapolis St Paul Los Angeles\nEl Paso Phoenix New Orleans on and on is it data driven like are you looking at ways in which that I can tell you about where they are and where they need to be well we have a world map and the world map is somebody uh signs up with us gets a sign that are specific number\nAnd they go up in the world map and when we know are they are and then you can look at the world map anywhere you are going or traveling and go visit a little free library\nWe know that they need to be really everywhere and we find out at higher social economic neighborhoods is more about building community in connecting community\nAnd the lower social economic neighborhoods us more about literacy and building reading um I opened one little free library and there is quite the hodgepodge a biography of the late jazz singer buddy Carter\nAnd adventurers guide to Hawaii there was a children's picture book\nDo these though in some way become a final resting place for books that people want to get rid of\nWhat happens is people often um their book lovers in book lovers tell us all the time that books are my heart and soul they defined my humanity to find who am I Can't live without books and they tell us all the time this is a natural extension of who they are\nAnd so the little free library becomes really a part of them they start out by doing just what you said is arresting ground for the something they want to get rid of the ... and it turns into the most intimate experience in the community because what happens\nIs you're sharing of your heart and who you are and what happens is people start sharing their best and most important books to reflect themselves to the community\nAnd for those unfamiliar with what these look like um they they are kind of schoolhouse like or bird house like that really everyone who Iraq's one does it a little differently what are some of the Internet like wacky or designs you've seen\nOil everything from rocket ships to you know we see things that are out of old ... old microwaves we see 'em on microwave old microwaves old fridge raiders of computers you know if people turn almost anything they can imagine into a little free library\nWhat is your favorite story about someone encountering a little free library will probably my favorite story was a I got approached by a ... the former governor Jim Doyle of Wisconsin He kept me on the shoulders he's where you're from right right yeah Scott's and\nAnd he said you know tied you said I have to tell you my wife and I love little free libraries and he said and I want to tell you what's going on in America I said that's not who we are right now he says this is not we as Americans we're not this device if\nWe're not this polarized he said little free libraries\nIs more about who we are he said we reach across the aisle we reach across the street we pick each other up we help each other we don't care where they're from we want to make their life better he said ... little free libraries more of a reflection of what Americans really hard and so uh that touch me deeply and\nOne more is that a man came up to me and he said after presentation\nLittle free libraries understand them it's like air conditioning and I said well you know what do you mean by how so yeah and he said well when he was a kid he's sixty something\nHe or the parents in his grandparents read on the\nDeck earn their porch they played in the streets with the kids in the sidewalks and you know the fields and then [noise]\nYou got air conditioning they went in the house just shut the windows shut the doors they turned on the TV and he said and it was all downhill from then in the digital divide began and he said but it's been over fifty years and with little free library we're talking again they're\nThey're connecting again with the neighborhood around them it does strike me as kind of beautifully analog you know little free libraries in the digital world and it's outside for that matter are you a steward that you have a little free librarian in front of your home\nTown of several I have is the first one you know the first one yet [laughter] that that would instill standing yeah it's still standing and I also have the thousands one that I put to make that is on her and my dad when he passed in in that one I have a music box you open it up and plays to dream the impossible dream which is kind of cool you're very poetic\nI think we're all passionate at heart and I think that all of us have that a passion inside that we just want to come out and one of the things about the little free library it just as the dance of the community and you find out how many people are really caring and really caring about their neighbors\nTodd Bowles speaking with us last year as the designated Denver a city of distinction for having more than five hundred little free libraries bull died Thursday at age sixty two from complications due to ... cancer\nColorado matters from CPR news [noise]\n\nColorado's weather forecast

U. T. and he joins us now from Austin most how much damage to be seen out there\nIt kinda depends on where you go up and down the river but ah what happened here this is a river flood and so\nI'm homes and properties that were closest to the river I have a ... in certain parts of the along the Leno in Colorado rivers have been flooded out now obviously a there was this really dramatic event earlier this week where you actually at a bridge get taken out\nOutside of kings when Texas actually the main bridge into town there\nAnd then on down the river as I said homes\nFlooded out neighborhoods evacuated in the town of marble falls they I'd I've visited an emergency shelter a few days ago where people had to spend the night after um you know leaving their homes um so yeah it's it's it's pretty dramatic and again it it really it it becomes a river flood it's concentrated along the swatter way for the most\nThe area has this ominous nicknamed flash flood alley why is that why is it so susceptible to flooding\nOur geography and our weather um but this is also known as the Texas hill country\nAnd so there are a lot of creeks and streams that run through this part of Texas and when we get massive rain events those things can fill up super fast a creek that might have been dry all year suddenly feels like a raging river and it can become highly dangerous now in this case where as I said we're actually seeing a kind of a river flood\nWhere we had um a lot of rain in a river basin that was a kind of to the northwest of Austin and that caused this massive surge of water to come down these rivers\nAnd now they've reached this reservoir that is above Austin and uh which is a flood control reservoir and so that's kind of containing and trying to release the flow of what was this historic are flooding event on the river\nNow the water level at lake Travis outside of Austin is it about seven hundred feet and if it keeps going up about I mean just about fourteen feet officials say the water will start to flow uncontrolled from that damn what's what's the danger there for the people downstream\nSo that's where it hits the spill away right and there is concern that if water starts going over the spillway that could endanger properties below it uh and part of the answer to that is that we do have added floodgates along the damn\nThat's a holds in lake Travis and what are people that managed that river that lake are trying to decide is whether they're going to open an additional floodgates that would\nIncrease the flow on the river that goes straight through Austin but it may a decrease the lake level you know a to a more comfortable\nLevel last month was the wettest September on record and it's not over more rain is in the forecast and it was just looking this morning that looks like at this point through Wednesday how concerned are people about what's still to come\nI mean I think ... in a situation like this now we've had it rains for I mean it's just been raining for a long time you are not always heavy storms but it it just feels like kind of a constant drizzle which isn't always the case in Texas you know\nOur ground is saturated are like I said our river system is for any more rain right now is is I'm concerned\nMost be shown a reporter at K.
