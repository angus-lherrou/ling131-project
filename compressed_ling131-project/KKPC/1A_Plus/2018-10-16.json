merit and a meeting and protecting someone or protecting life\nThat's the kind of guy Steve is he was in a convoy in Baghdad when a roadside bomb went off\nIt killed a good friend of mine that he was like a father to me or my team came to my rescue pulled me from the vehicle really the important thing is they saved my life and and and I'm here today because of that\nAfter the explosion Vasquez was in and out of consciousness and remembers waking up with patches on his eyes\nLaying in the hospital bed and touching my eyes and trying to imagine\nWhat happened in in where I was he was halfway around the world in Washington DC at Walter Reed Army Medical center\nAnd he was now blind for me I share and darkness into a still world and that can be very suffocating and I'm just left with thinking 'cause visually on not distracted Sean stuck in my mind constantly\nWhat gets them out of his head is movement and he often finds that movement on Colorado's rivers\nAnd I like to say that moving this living and so when I get out on water is very dynamic very flowing it's alive underneath you\nAnd to be able to come and kayak through whitewater a with a guide and navigate through six features which I think this white water park cash you don't feel as disabled the\nBaskets and I are sitting on a park bench next to the ... river in ... on the western slope\nBaskets first came to town as a visit to kayak with the veterans for now he's moving here\nWhich is exactly what folks in town once\nIn the last six years Montrose has tried to reshape itself has a destination for vets place that will ease their transition to civilian life\nThis effort is called the welcome home alliance for veterans and at\nThe heart of it not far from the river is the warrior resource center\nWe have a display cases of different memorabilia that a lot of our veterans have brought in that is meaningful for them\nExecutive director Mike tricky and I take a look around one of the main gathering spaces and there's a big round table in the middle I'm seeing how that were part of military uniforms ... there's a scale model\nOf that is the US's Montrose the U.S has ... well that's a nice name we like it we don't like it I can say oh\nI see a lot of uh flags in the triangle cases I remember receiving one of those when my grandfather in the air force passed away\nAnd those are of flags representing some of our veterans that are have passed away since we've\nBeen here and what is this place what is it what does it do it heals\nIt affords veterans opportunity to just be themselves\nTo engage in conversations with each other to share their stories\nWar stories war stories stories of of how they struggled to get back into society other successes but it's an opportunity to do that in such a way that they feel safe they feel comfortable there not judged are you a veteran Israel\nI spent four years and ring for\nSixty eight Seventy two and a [noise]\nYou're tearing up I Wonder why [noise]\nI feel very fortunate to be in this position right now or I can listen to and relate a lot of the experiences that veterans have when I see men and women here in the center talking about\nTheir experiences and and seeing that camaraderie that is created you just can't help\nBut to be moved by that\nIt seems that the fundamentals of this is the idea of veterans being with other veterans so helpful to have someone who gets it\nExactly especially the combat veterans um\nThey have a very unique way of\nCommunicating with each other when do you mean it's almost surreal show I'm trying to see\nGrown men get emotional and the similarities of their experiences\nAnd that may be across generations is my understanding so it might be someone who is in Operation Iraqi freedom relating to a Vietnam veteran\nAnd a Korean Veterans relating to the Gulf War\nVeteran I wondered how did VFW is an American legion been doing this work for a long time yes tricky tells me but this is a community wide effort the alliance lobbied the VA to get more housing for veterans in Montrose it became a clearinghouse for services and open this safe place for veterans to gather\nIt also got local businesses to offer a veterans discounts shopkeepers put a little sticker in their window\nThousands of vets live in this county and if they need anything chances are they'll find it at the warrior resource center because people constantly donate things\nGood electric wheelchairs list for those chairs terriers for those chairs canes walkers transfer boards a back\nBrace is this is John

that about to veterans\nCame back from Vietnam and they were treated like like dirt in many cases Troy\nDavis's own story of service is unforgettable his job in Vietnam was too sweet for land mines with a bulldozer with a big old blade\nReinforced belly pans cover and what we did is we started the daylight and gotten the roads are thirty two and we clear Fifteen sixteen hundred acres day level\nI Can't imagine what that job must have been doing in and day out in other words you were hyper vigilant you were on edge I'm assuming I don't want to put words in your nose but if I were in a

President Trump's defending himself against critics you questioned his business connections to Saudi Arabia whose crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is widely suspected of playing a role in the disappearance impossible murder of a dissident journalists Saudi Arabia denies the allegation\nOn Twitter today Trump writes that he has no financial interest in Saudi Arabia however in a campaign rally in two thousand Fifteen Trump was open to talk about business ties to Saudis in the United states\nSaudi Arabia and I get along great with they buy apartments for me to forty million Fifteen million am I supposed to dislike him I like him very much\nFrom NPR and WB you are I'm Robyn Young I'm Jeremy hops in its here and now secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh Saudi Arabia he's been meeting today with king saw him on and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAmid growing concerns about Saturday involvement in the death of journalist and us resident ... ... ...\nThere are reports that Saudi Arabia is getting ready to acknowledge that ... died during a botched interrogation at the Saturday consulate in Istanbul, Turkey for the latest let's bring in LA though she had MSNBC anchor in economics correspondent and co host of ... in rural Hi alec age are and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we do it as a fully come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something but uh\nSaid yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king ... the father uh Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a rogue group of people maybe having a kill Jamal ...\nAh and then that's what the Saudis are floating at the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing the threat of sanctioned and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and\nWhen you say the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that might compare the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft explanation for what happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out my Mike Pompeo is there a if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis are this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered a that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses\nThe president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what has all this\nDone to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia end with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia under the bus for this\nAlleged murder and then releasing this pastor is trying to go up a few notches in terms of its relationship with America\nA Saudi Arabia has a very very strong very long a business financial diplomatic arms and energy relationship with the United states and this is the first time in the history of those two countries are at least since Nineteen Seventy three sons they are a bullet oil embargo that it's been this fraught what\nAbout all the companies that have gotten upset and decided that they're not going to go to this big Saturday investment conference J. P. Morgan black rock MasterCard Hooper just to name a few\nUm we have to remember that Saudi Arabia has also been involved in a number of other human rights abuses including the war in Yemen Yemen's writes press freedom a high ... are these companies are likely to just go back to business as usual once this gets cleared up or is it just made them think hard about their relationship with Saudi Arabia\nWell Germany you bring up a good point ... is not unique he happens to be a critic he's not actually the loudest critics of Saudi Arabia um and and Saudi Arabia does this sort of thing a lot they silence journalists and they they crush dissent so these American companies\nHave had nothing to say about that until now something about this and maybe it's because he's the Washington Post columnist maybe it's because he's an American\nResidents something about this has changed the dialogue with all of these companies backing out now as of now treasury secretary my Nugent is still headed to the conference as is Christine Lagarde the head of the IMF so\nI'm all may not be lost but I think the Saudis are realizing that uh you know they're the biggest spenders NPR lobbying in Washington I think they're starting to realize if something doesn't happen\nThey stand to lose a lot of these important relationships\nWill it brings me to one more thing just in thirty seconds we have left here alley um how important is Saudi Arabia economically for the United states\n[noise] huge like it's the it's America's number one weapons by her the president is talking to Leslie stall on a sixty minutes said\nYou know he quoted Boeing and Lockheed Martin and write the honest sellers to Saudi Arabia linking our economic relationship to jobs it's also the second largest uh him but you know we get the second largest amount of oil from Saudi Arabia Canada is first so\nThe relationship with Saudi Arabia is actually quite big in terms of military in oil that's how I Know she MSNBC anchor in economics correspondent thank you pleasure\nWell also on that sixty minutes program on CBS this past weekend Lesley Stahl asked President Trump about that report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change that warned that rising temperatures could cause irreparable damage to the earth idea twenty forty\nDo you still think that climate change is a hoax look I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade\nWell at least a Twenty one young people across the country who disagree with the president and have joined a lawsuit against this administration thing it hasn't done enough to fight climate change and everyone's surprise that lawsuit is going to trial later this month\nOne of the plant is is eleven year old Levi dre hind he joins us from satellite Beach Florida Levi first where did you make of the president's comments\nWell I honestly don't know what to think of that because there's so many evidence that climate king is an actual thing and it's affecting actual people like me and all the other plaintiffs in this lawsuit but how is it affecting you\nUm well I think it affected me because it's the love arrives I'm On a barrier island and that barrier island is like right level at the end so way\nIn the water level rises then it will flood the island like after Hurricane Irma flooded are street and things like that yeah\nWell yeah you were paddling to the beach instead of blocking yeah yeah a look you're part of the suits there was actually put together by a group called our children's trust um what is the main complaint of the city I mean what is the suit alleging\nWell what this lawsuit is saying is it saying that the U.S government is violating our constitutional right to have a clean sustainable level the playing it it's not that they're not doing anything is that they know that climate change that problem\nBut I think that they are doing I helping cod climate change like not cutting down on fossil fuels and things like that\nWill you know I was surprised that there are as many suit as there are they've tripled since twenty four team there's the most during the ...\nThere's about six hundred and fifty for us lawsuits and there have been other successes in Pakistan a lawyer sued his government\nFor not doing enough about climate change and one and Pakistan as a result has had to have action points in ministries and create a government commission where do you want to see happen because of your lawsuit\nOn if we win this lawsuit what we want is you want there to be um to for the government to put climate recovery plan into place and even if that doesn't happen we're going to keep on fighting all the way through and tried to file again\nNow judges on the Supreme Court has said that the claim that's made in your lawsuit that the government is violating your right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness by not doing more to the climate change\nIs broad and leaves a lot of room for differences of opinion we heard from the president a lesson in fact let's listen to the president again from his sixty minutes interview talking again about climate change\nThey say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just said\nWith Michael ... says that they say I mean they say that India but what about scientists who say it's worse than ever\nAre you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda\nThere is a difference of opinion right there he thinks it's political if this goes all the way to the Supreme Court are you worried that particular Trump appointed judges will allow room for opinion and not go on science [noise]\nUm I'm honestly not worried because we have lots of scientific facts\nAnd we have scientists that said things that prove our case I so I'm not really worried because it's pretty hard to fight science [noise]\nListen to one of your other a fellow plaintiffs this is a Thirteen year old Avery McCray and why she decided to join the suit\nI Know that I have a constitutional right to a stable climate\nAnd I know that one of the government's jobs just to make sure that the future plan it will be hospitable for generations to come\nI Know that I Can't though but I Know what I said I had a voice [laughter]\nLook that's very admirable um but some people say well maybe these are kids being used I Want to ask you about that you were only eight years old when you became part of the lawsuit do you worry about people saying that you were being used\n\nIt's sunny and warm or for Denver and much of Colorado metro high in the fifties today and tomorrow then closer to sixty for Thursday and

little red schoolhouse progressive private school in Manhattan decided to end an experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected Casson is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group in your students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help their academic achievement\nWill you said that a part of this was based on that you know research this wasn't an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special news for um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing them so\nWas in the schools teachers our students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWill you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identities what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of the development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of a few African American students in his or her class to feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced or having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experiences and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively isn't home all the place where it's as much a you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYou know this is an unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being
