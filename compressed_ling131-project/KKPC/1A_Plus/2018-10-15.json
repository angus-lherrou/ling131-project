NPR's Mara Liasson has the latest\nPresident said quote we'll get to the bottom of the show he disappearance but he also said he talked to the Saudi king who he said firmly and flatly denied any knowledge of the show these disappearance Trump even suggested an alternative theory of the case\nIt sounded to me like they should have a role for\nThe president's reaction to the quote from denials by the Saudis sounded a lot like his reaction to Vladimir Putin's quote strong denials about election interference\nAnd has suggested that maybe someone else was at fault sounded like his suggestion that the Democrats emails could have been hacked by quote somebody sitting on their bed that weighs four hundred pounds Mara Liasson NPR News the White House\nA federal judge in Boston is hearing opening statements today in a lawsuit alleging Harvard University discriminates against Asian applicants from member station WBFO Walmart Simone Rios has more\nThe issue is spearheaded by conservative activists Edward Blum\nWe believe the evidence shows the Harvard systematically raises the bar for Asian Americans and systematically lowers it for whites African Americans and Hispanics\nIn defense of Harvard sophomore album Sam says considering race is a key part of the admissions process take that away with\nOne of their friends or classmates or somebody who is seen as the leader or even just seen as kind of uh uh the popular person in in school I'm that this is a sort of a a a way and to sort of\nA help improve the lives of a lot of people\nYou're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're speaking with NPR's Kirk Siegler who is just back from a reporting trip to Grand Junction where he is looked at how that community\nIs struggling with suicide and how to prevent it and the natural question comes up Kirk and and this is something that some in rural America are resistant to but access to firearms and perhaps limiting access\nTo guns or how do people in Mesa County react when you bring that up [noise] [noise] well\nI think it's it's being more talked about it to be more talked about it than it has a about three or four years ago I was in Wyoming reporting on a similar story directly looking at the access to guns issue [noise]\nUh and that's a tricky one for folks in suicide prevention to navigate um you know the rural west nine of the ten states with the highest suicide rates in the country are in the rural west including Alaska in those states also happen to have some of the highest a firearm ownership rates in the country\nSo I think the trick is or I don't want to say necessarily a trick but the the the challenges sort of buy for creating the two by saying like we're not talking about gun control we're talking about suicide prevention and\nAnd uh this is not about taking your guns away this is about making sure that your guns are locked up or in a safe place or being able to um recognize somebody who might be in trouble or at risk were vulnerable to harming themselves and keeping the firearms away from them this could be in the family\nThis could be at the gun shops in fact there is a\nFairly active a gunshot project going on in Mesa County and in other western slope communities trying to educate people about ... and gun shop owners and clerks about recognizing some of the warning signs but it is a ... it is a very tricky issue and one that's difficult to navigate in particular in the rural west where\nA gun ownership is sort of woven tightly in folks identity I don't want to sound so academic there but it is a big part of the culture I don't need to tell you\nA suicide or buy firearms is also a huge uh issue and in fact the majority of people in Mesa County I daresay few surveyed other western rural counties guns is how people commit this final act\nYou spoke with Genevieve Morris she's a suicide prevention coordinator from Mesa County valley school district fifty one\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing things that need to change\nAnd part of what you talked about needing to change Kirk is just the [noise]\nA stigma around mental health around suicide I Wonder if you might tell us about another perhaps exceptionally young person you met maybe one who has had personal experience and their family with suicide\nOnes that comes to mind is an eighth grader who's also a you know peer to peer counselor within the middle school districts really young now in Mesa County uh she both her father and her uncle\nUm had died by suicide um just some heart wrenching stories it's not hard to find somebody who knows somebody as I said a and getting around the ... even being able to talk about it um you know the rural west in particular is known as you know very rugged individualistic at least that's the\nThe stereotype and um you know you just got to pull yourself up and and even if you're struggling like there's a stigma around sort of asking for help there's also not a lot of resources and a lot of these places one thing that really stuck out to me was that\nUh there's only one mental health hospital um between Denver and Salt Lake city uh there are they are adding beds but there's only a few dozen beds there so you also have to talk about lack of resources or in rural areas in particular Kirk thanks so much certainly\nI'm so sorry to say that's that's a larger Lyman for today and we look forward to the reports coming from you on that\nOne eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nThis is a great comment from Bridgette in Longmont you says I'm finally ended financial position to be able to give after listening almost daily\nFor the last two years well congratulations on your new a financial situation thanks a lot Bridget for your support and she was one of those people who for a couple of years\nListen without giving which is fine but uh but now she's able to support Colorado Public radio and help keep this service ally for everybody else who is not able to get any way\nTo make that contribution you do that too when you go to CPR dot org or when you called eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nYeah getting it's not mandatory when you listen to Colorado Public radio but when you give a gift you are voicing your support for a community resource that\nYou think is important you think it's important you're listening right now during the membership drive you you think it's important because you still want to get the news that you're going to hear coming up in just a bit\nAnd we couldn't do it without you and again your support makes this possible for others to listen who can't get\nCPR dot org one eight hundred for nine six one five three zero and right now we do have that trip to London\nThat's right so your gift right now does something great for the entire community that is to keep CPR strong\nOf for you and for everybody regardless of whether or how much you know people are supporting the other thing is your gift right now is completely selfish because you get under during this trip to London and that could be you jetting over to London direct from Denver by the way to non-stop flight\nIt's Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan Warner ballots are now hitting the mail for the midterm election voters here will choose the next governor and decide on some big tax and spending measures\nWhich is where ... comes in the podcast from CPR news and this week we asked is it really fair to call Colorado a swing state is it really purple here's hosts him brush\nMost weeks on his podcast were the ones posing questions about Colorado ahead of the election this week something a little bit different or answering a question from one view\nI'm Jonas was into I'm a sophomore at Denver Jewish day school I'm sixteen get that's about it\nJust contacted us through our Colorado wonders project at the new CPR effort trying to explore the state one question at a time and you contacted us with a question about Colorado politics and you go ahead and say what the question was\nYeah the question was is Colorado is still a swing state [noise]\nWhy someone too young to vote even wondering about something like this well for John as this came up as he reflected on his earliest experiences with politics\nIf I recall practically in those ... and in fourth grade we had mocked presidential election [noise] we went into the closet filled out a ballad [noise] see I remember the ballot was on green paper and had the two candidates Mitt Romney abruptly Obama in ...\nAnd McCain and Barack Obama Obama a mixed result in these two election he won in kindergarten de la ... and ... when he came to either these do classroom elections or the real deal Jonas had the feeling that Colorado was up for grabs\nAnd I do remember sort of vaguely at the time\nThat Colorado was important nationally lots of politicians visited there is a ton of ads on the air and he says it just didn't feel the same and twenty sixteen like there was a bit less attention a bit less coverage on Colorado it seemed like it didn't occupied in so much of a national ... bottom I'm\nSure the candidates campaign here but pundits talked about Colorado is all but a sure bet for Hillary Clinton and she ended up winning here by about three points two years from now joined us will\nBe eligible to vote and he's not sure what to expect I Want to know what I should be looking for if I should be looking at Colorado politics from the perspective of swing state voter are from the perspective of their state voter\nI Want to know what sort of policies I expect Colorado politicians both in the state and nationally to advocate and I want to know what my fellow Colorado and think about things [noise]\nAnd it's not just joined us asking this question this is something I wandered the head of watching this podcast I mean this is probably obvious but it's called purplish because Colorado isn't red or blue but purple it's in the middle and hosts competitive elections but is that label even true anymore\nAnd this is about more than our branding competitive elections helped consulting so advice TV station sell ads journalists like me grab your attention and it arguably helps voters to says Seth mascot he's a political scientist at the University of Denver\nBut basically means the state party the national parties will develop a lot more attention they'll devote a lot more resources there'll be a lot more media attention on those contests a that usually stimulates voter interest in voter turnout\nIn fact Colorado has among the highest voter turnout in the country some of that may have to do with the state's mail in ballot system which makes finding a stamp the hardest part of voting but it can't hurt that voters here feel like their voices matter so this weekend purplish how\nPurple Colorado really and our days of occupying the political center and the political center of attention numbered\nThere's a narrative out there about Colorado is political leanings and it goes something like this ...\nOnce upon a time Colorado was reliable Republican state and it pretty much stay that way to the beginning of this century minute voted for George W. Bush twice in the Rocky Mountain west color of the state of Colorado He ran\nFor President George W\nButton that started to change after two thousand and four when younger more educated people started moving to Colorado they created an opportunity for Democrats who seized it\nThan you know it [noise]\n\n... accepted the Democratic nomination in Denver on a stage midfield at bronco stadium before winning the state in two thousand and eight and he was here again in twenty twelve\nBattleground states and the west one of the most closely watched was Colorado\nAnd yet that he did in two thousand eight presidents volunteer that stayed\nHome and in twenty sixteen Hillary Clinton dominated upholding Colorado media outlets started declaring that the state had fallen off the electoral map celebrate\nAll the Colorado is it's all the time to talk about what Colorado isn't anymore a swing state\n... ...\n... there were numbers to back that up head of the twenty sixteen election Democrats outpaced Republicans among registered voters in Colorado for the first time in three decades and on a night when Trump won the electoral college Colorado went for Clinton\nWe had another protection right now it has a projection for Hillary state of Colorado in this story\nTwenty sixteen supposedly marked a kind of a rival for Colorado on a journey from red to purple too now light blue\nBut some people aren't totally sold on this suppose a tale of political transformation Sam breaks it down further after a break this is Colorado matters and purple lush from CPR news\nMy name's Ryan I live in Grand junction\nAnd I've been listening to NPR and CPR since I was exposed to it through my best friend in middle school his parents and right now I delivering pizzas\nBut I listen to it several hours tonight and I feel like you know that amount of time spent assuming deserves a price tax if I can afford it and I feel like I can afford it I wasn't able to and so I decided to call up and make a donation I'm an African partner thanks very\nWell thank you Ryan in Grand junction and did you hear that he started listening to Colorado Public radio in middle school you have the opportunity now to

behind suspected killing of this critical his regime here's ... conclusion\nShout at me like they won't go to the bottom of it very here's what is really a flat denial NPR's\nInternational affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has been following this Jackie this is a fast moving story but a real killer in a conflict a killer who somehow gets a body out of the ... what is what is the latest on the president's thinking\nOh well the latest in this story actually more like a ... vote 'em a dozen Turkish in Saudi investigators have entered the U.S Saudi consulate in Istanbul right now um and that was as you say the last place that democracy was seen\n'em in the during a search of the conflict and they brought along a crime scene investigative a van they brought the into Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had offered investigators to search the cars would a few days after ... went missing\nSo thinking about a week and a half to get investigators in there and get a search underway I'm In Saudi Arabia may finally allowed it to go ahead it's a way to calm rising tensions between the kingdom in the U.S now well on sixty minutes last night the president promised severe punishment of Saudi Arabia is behind she'll he's a disappearance and possible death\nBut today he says maybe it's real killers\nHe also said last night on sixty minutes he didn't want to hold a proposed one hundred and ten\nOur arms sales to Saudi Arabia as punishment is some are suggesting is that would hurt American manufacturers and he said everybody in the world wants that order he he said this before including Russia and China is that true [noise]\nUm yes just to clarify something you know first of all what analysts say that the arms deal is worth a lot no question but that the one hundred and ten billion dollar figure being bandied around by Trump is really inflated\nAnd a lot of the deals are just letters of intent to not actual signed deals\nAnd many of them in fact started during the Obama administration\nBut I think the president is right that Russia and China would be interested in selling weaponry to Saudi Arabia is a very rich country and it's always looking for arms\nBut whether the kingdom itself would want to buy those a U.S arms uh by the Russian or Chinese over by us arms is really another story you know the fact is it's unlikely Saudi Arabia\nWants to annoy or alienate the U.S has a very important ally to the royal family\nHow is this going over in the region [noise] well\nDisney in Saudi Arabia I mean you get in a completely different picture than you are really and the rest of the world is very much that the world is against Saudi Arabia that you know basically wrote killers were involved with that the Saudi royal family had nothing to do with the whole\nIncident um you know and then it getting some of that backing from the United Arab Emirates\nAs well as Bahrain which are very close allies with Saudi Arabia\nBut you know as the rest of the world is looking at this is an international crisis and the disappearance and perhaps murder of democracy\nHas really touched a nerve worldwide\nNow well and as you mentioned that the region is viewing it or at least in Saudi Arabia the viewing and his possibly will kill us we heard the president pick up on that team\nToday NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam thanks as
