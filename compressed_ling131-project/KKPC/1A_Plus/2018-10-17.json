one hundred Ninety million dollars to individual campaigns with about three weeks to go before election day\nCPR is Ben Marcus has been following the money and he joins me now then why has so much money being spent on this election\nReally it comes down to two groups the oil and gas industry and Jared polish and both of those groups are breaking records just by themselves\nOkay the oil and gas industry they are fighting a battle on like two different fronts\nRight yes this is interesting because they're supporting one measure and this would basically if it passes would force governments to compensate them for new regulations or any business really for new regulations\nAnd they're also fighting a ballot measure that would effectively bad most new drilling at least according to the industry and so they've raised a staggering thirty eight million dollars in their campaign group that's almost double the next closest I could find in state history going back to two thousand fourteen there was a measure\nTo expand casino games that Aurora horse tracks that raise twenty million that was the previous record uh it should be noted too that the group that is supporting the setbacks are against the industry they've raise less than a million dollars so you got thirty eight million to less than one million\nNow the Colorado governor's races also breaking spending records with Jared polish the Democratic candidates are spending a good portion of his own fortune on his campaign\nTwenty two million dollars so far I'm nobody's ever spend money like that on their own campaign in Colorado history you've spent eleven million dollars of his own money just since the primary um he's attack millionaire he's never been afraid of spending money on politics\nAnd his Republican opponent Walker Stapleton or he's cobbled together about Thirteen million dollars both in his own campaign and superPACs would support him\nPull it also has a constellation of pack superPACs with support him as well who are contributing almost eight million dollars so huge money advantage to Jared polish but Walker Stapleton also has a significant amount of cash to get his message out\nIt's also going to be a crowded ballot with a lot of ballot measures and a lot of spending on those campaigns to\nWrites everybody's ballot will be a little bit different depending on where you live Denver voters will see twenty some odd questions on their ballot but quickly the transportation sales tax will be on there that's around about ten million dollars in campaign spending\nA increased income taxes for schools are a couple of million bucks on both sides about issue restrictions on payday lenders there's millions of dollars flowing into that issue as well\nAnd there's also money then flowing into especially state Senate races where Republicans have a narrow majority and they want to keep it\nFor the state Senate is very much in play at one seat majority for Republicans are and so we've seeing money poured into these racism ounce I've never seen before a Democrats have a huge advantage and direct contributions to candidates\nThree to one two to one advantage and they also have an advantage and superPACs I'm so there's millions of dollars flowing into super PACs that will\nDecide the fate of this election but Democrats definitely have the advantage in both superPAC and direct a fundraising and they say that that show there's momentum behind the Democrats whereas Republicans are saying\nIt doesn't really matter like you can there's diminishing returns after so many millions of dollars you can't buy anymore TV space and it's all take it up\nA and Republicans also feel like some of the ballot measures will get conservative voters out to vote because their tax increase of 'em so Republicans feel pretty good about their chances that they've been able to get their message out even though they have a big money disadvantage", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A
