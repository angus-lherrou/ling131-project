Warner Colorado's new law cracking down on prescription opioids could have unintended consequences\nSome doctors worry that people in legitimate pain won't get the medications they need\nMatthew ... is medical ethicist and director of the center for bio ethics and humanities at the University of Colorado and shoots medical campus and we'll come back to the program nice to be here thanks for having the law we're talking about which just recently went into effect\nLimits opioid prescriptions to a seven day supply in most cases than it would have to be renewed by a doctor and I'll say there are exceptions for people in hospice care or those with chronic pain or who have some serious illnesses like cancer but\nWhat is your fear in in what is that fear based on\nI think the concern here is that um there will be physicians and nurse practitioners others who make these prescriptions who will be a so concerned with\nA breaking the law and putting that kind of scared quotes because these are more guidelines than they are laws on but there will be people who are so concerned with breaking the law that they will become overly cautious in um prescribing pain medication to people who legitimately need the pain medicine\nAnd we are starting all ready to see examples of this nationwide where patients who need pain for legitimate purposes pain medication\nFor legitimate purposes are finding it difficult either to find a doctor who's willing to write the prescription or sometimes even to find a pharmacy willing to fill\nTo buy it it's more susceptible to miscommunication and misunderstanding until lack of trust and so on\nInteresting and so if there's any racial bias perhaps a that is affecting a physician's decision making or perception of a patient that could have real consequences for say an African American patient walking into a doctor's office right and\nOf course on an individual level um it's it's pretty uncommon to find a a clinician who is overtly biased in terms of race but we also know that implicitly people tend to have um you know\nStereotypes that that unfortunately come into play in all of our human to human interactions and they're particularly at risk when you're dealing with something where communication is really at the core of the entire interaction\nIt strikes me that fundamental to this is teaching a health care professionals as much as you can to differentiate between people who are legitimately in pain and trying to communicate that to you versus someone who is essentially trying to do you\nAh is is that a skill that that doctors are taught easy is it even a skill that can be taught\nAs a great question um it is something we try to teach a I don't know that there are you know great studies that prove that it is teachable because in the end um this is a human to human interaction and whether someone is trying to dupe you or whether they're telling you the truth\nThere was this one guy in particular who seemed to have put a lot of thought into this is real quick introduce yourself to be what's your name\nSure Joshua Adam I live in Denver\nColorado and I asked him the same question I'd ask everyone else so when you get your about this week and you go to a job in the mail and drop it off how confident and you feel um that it's going to be counted correctly [noise]\nUm [noise] from\nThe things on which I've recently happened that have been in the news breaking news the federal government has revealed that hackers targeted election systems in Twenty one states last things that I read on a and seen on social media it's alarming and concerning because\nI mean with so many different systems that I've played with our ... our balance that's scary\nWhen I asked him for more specifics he said he's most worried about Russian and how he thinks they've been messing with our election do\nWe really have a voice or are we yelling in a hole or hit and somebody else is actually the one pulling the strings in the background [noise]\nIs he right to be concerned that a foreign government could hack the election\nI mean we can't say no because they tried to years ago Russian hackers attacked state election systems including ours in Colorado it didn't work as far as we know but Adam stop that Russians had done that had actually change the vote tallies until after election\nFrom the things that they have found they mess with the election right\nSo if the people in Russia can do it why can't the people here doing\nWhat we do know about the twenty sixteen election from the Mueller investigation and other work is that the Russian government was trying to influence how people do things like fake news website propaganda\nBut as far as we know they didn't actually change any votes right but Adams isn't alone in thinking that they did a recent NPR poll\nOn that one in three Americans believe it's likely a foreign country will change vote tallies in the upcoming election like one in three American and that's not good because if people think their votes won't town\nThis whole system of democracy of self governance crumbles people might not show up to the polls they might not see their elected leaders as legitimate democracy really depends on people trusting election results it's clear that even in a state like Colorado where we supposedly have this really good election security system\nVoters here are skeptical to\nThis weekend purplish we're going to look at how Colorado gained its reputation for being the most reliable state the cat's about and why in twenty Eighteen that expert opinion might not be enough to put Colorado voters [noise]\nOkay but they didn't mind it let's do it how did Colorado get so good at election security I think to really understand it you have to go back to two thousand [noise]\nAn election in ... a presidency and the ballot and they shouldn't wait [noise]\nWho really emerged in the story\nWhich is the moment where people in America start to doubt this technology but to find our elections for so long paper ballots\n[noise] the Florida recount showed all the just embarrassing problems that can come along with a traditional punch card system\nFirst you have to know that the punch hole is called lake Chad\nSo you've heard about all this chat stuff right yeah like the hanging chads out I was only ten minutes all went down but I mean it was everywhere\nYeah I was twelve a but the ... paper ballots are not foolproof right\nThen followed Chad there is an invitation and the ... the voter put some pressure on it but didn't catch it at all from the ballot and those were not you\nKnow certain designs can leave a lot of room for human error\nAnd the final category is the practice chat that as a chat with parents with\nThem and then in Palm Beach County Florida that the whole design of the ballot was problematic\nDemocrats charge against using ballot layoffs let voters to things that were punching the ballot for our war when they were actually voting for reform party candidate how you can and three five hundred people did not\nOn is heavily democratic county\nThe Supreme Court eventually ended the recount and declared George Bush the winter but the turmoil in Florida led to this bill called the help America vote act harbor and it was designed in large part to phase out old voting\nMachine when I first voting against the equipment I use the vote then as they're coming out of USA Today and that is true of so many different states to improve that\nAs a result of harbor six hundred and fifty million was provided to the states to replace lover and punch card machines for more modern voting equipment\nBasically the federal government had a plan to make voting systems more modern and accessible and the guidelines they spelled out led many places to purchase electronic voting machines and why like what were the advantages to those devices\nSo the interfaces were clear in some cases more straightforward than paper ballots and many of them were more accommodating of people with disabilities and then also you don't have piles of paper to sort through an account\nBut around the country and in Colorado people started to worry about these things\nWho like who is raising the objections to these voting machines in Colorado so what are the most persistent activists was\nThis guy I'm Neil McDermott I'm an independent consultant I went up to Boulder recently to meet Mick burn it is just how guy with a big bushy red beer and just a sweet nice guy and he sort of like equal parts tech whiz and has believer in democracy\nDemocracy is hugely important and recognizing the threats long before anyone was talking about Russia\nOr cyber attacks has been a big motivator for me and he had an opportunity to get involved back in two thousand and two ... a friend called me up and said hey they need election judges and I said that sounds fun like to know more about the mechanics of process\nLike an election judge so he's one of those people that oversee everything at a polling station and then they're often the ones who give you that my I voted sticker\nRight and in two thousand to Boulder County still had paper ballots but has a computer scientists make burn it did not like they're system\nI was nervous because they were using computers to count and report our vote and I saw no one's paying attention to the paper ballots that people had marked their choices on what may\nBurn it ... this is at Boulder wasn't doing anything to keep track of its paper ballots that gets fed them into a computer and then paid attention to the final vote counts I mean what's wrong with that the results are what matters here right I'm not really because let's say someone did manage to hack in and change where it's\nHow do you know like if you had the original paper ballots kept under lock and key and carefully kept track of them you could use that to track against those results [noise]\nIt's critical to have paper involved in elections in order to allow us to look at the evidence for each individual election and see if the evidence the paper ballots actually matches what a computer's produce as the outcome of the election\nSo in other counties we're moving toward electronic voting systems make burn it and others convince Boulder to stick with paper\nAnd the previous clerk looked like she was on a path where she wanted to use more electronic equipment\nThis is Hillary hall the Boulder County clerk in recorder she credits people like me burn it for preventing that from happening\nAre citizens really engaged our commissioners and through that we ended up with a model where everyone would vote on a mail ballot unless you want it to use the accessible equipment in most people cast their ballot on paper\nOkay so in places across the country that aren't Boulder counties or sometimes are moving more towards electronic voting systems right\nBut this backlash gross and then eventually gets into a Halloween episode\nWhen it does to lick dramatic voting ... homeruns using a touch screen and it's not working\nOne vote for McCain thank you you know what they want to vote for Obama to vote for McCain come on and it's time for change three votes for McCain no no no six votes for President McCain\nAnd it's been a Halloween episode Homer is actually eaten by voting machines\nMaybe Ohio\nBut anyway the point is that these new machines\nWere becoming a joke in their own right\nOkay so people started to raise doubts about these machines and whether they were accurate and safe and it would work what happens in Colorado once that movement gross\nSo the counties across if they start taking notice and move toward neighbor themselves and adult combination twenty Thirteen when the state legislature passes a bill moving Colorado to all male and paper ballot and part of that was to increase access but it also meant that almost every\nVote in the state now was kept on paper the one exemption is overseas voters in for Neal Mick burn it after years of pushing this was like sweet sweet victory ...\nYeah I was absolutely thrilled it's exciting when something that you've cared about for so long starts coming to fruition it always takes longer than you think I have to say that\n[noise] when we come back Sam follows a ballad from kitchen table the tabulation where's the voting system most vulnerable Colorado matters from CPR news [noise]\n\nThis is CPR news kind of weather turning much colder by tomorrow high today in the seventies again around Denver and Colorado Springs\nAbove eighty and probably low and along the front range much colder temperatures coming on Tuesday highs only in the forties around the metro area tomorrow with rain and snow through the day\nAs voter fraud is all too common and then they criticize us for saying that\nAnd we have even Republicans oh that's such a terrible thing to say [noise] back\nWhen was that Trump bite from\nSo that was a rally back in October twenty sixteen in Colorado Springs and I picked it because it just so happens that our Republican secretary of state when Williams who runs our election system he lives in Colorado Springs and so I asked him if his mission to promote the election system is complicated by President Trump's rhetoric\nYes it causes challenges for me do I wish everybody would say things that were correct all the time yeah that makes my life a whole lot easier\nAnd Williams really sees it as his job to be a cheerleader in this respect to boost confidence in the system\nIf people do not believe the legitimacy of the election results than they denied the legitimacy of the government they refused to pull over for the police officer they\nUm refuse to pay taxes they refused to stop for the red light you know what for uh the issue may be and that's not the type of chaos that we [noise]\nIn Colorado or the United states and I don't think we'll get there I think states like Colorado or showing a way out of that morass or out of that possibility\nIs that working does opening up our electoral system to the public explaining it to journalists like us just that build up trust in democracy\nWell I mean we don't have number specific to Colorado like that poll we mentioned earlier about a third of American voters thinking that foreign governments can change votes that was national about what we\nDo know is that Colorado has great voter turnout more than Seventy percent in twenty sixteen nationwide it was more like fifty eight percent\nAnd it's also notable that in our highest profile races you don't see a Jared Pulitzer Walker Stapleton actively undermining our electoral system\nThey're not saying the whole system is rigged like President Trump did in twenty sixteen\nRight exactly but let's let's go back to that guy we met earlier Joshua Adams he was downtown I gave him a quick recap of power system works\nSo there's there's a lot of things in place to make sure that your ballot is counting correctly that does that make you feel any different\nIt does make me feel different it does make me feel a little bit better\nI think even more so what is now more alarming to me even with that new information is the fact that there's so much misinformation that if a person like myself\nIs completely crazily misinformed then how many other people who are like me are now misinformed and don't really know what to do how to do anything\nAnd Adams says his life is just ticking off like he works a lot of overtime that he doesn't have time to read the newspaper and educate them so\nThen it's easier to spread misinformation that people who are desperate and we and that's the problem we're all desperate to just live right now [noise] [noise]\nAnd that's the challenge here for\nEvery Joshua there are more people who just don't buy into the system\nI mean is that a problem because it's okay to be skeptical wishing it blindly trust that our elections systems are safe we should demand proof that they are saying yeah\nTotally like I agree uh experts an election officials also agree they say that Colorado has to keep getting better way to Williams says that and the Democrat running for a seat right now ... while she says that too she wants to try to get more money from the feds to make the systems better\nBut where we are right now in October twenty Eighteen I think we have to acknowledge that Colorado has built a system that seems to be working really well and if you don't believe that election officials here are more than happy to show their work you just have to care enough and have the time to get involved\nBut it does seem like there's two parts to the challenge here again it's it's not just that election officials have to stay one step ahead of hackers and always be wary of weaknesses in their system they have to convince the public that their vote will in fact account and I guess I'm just not totally sure yet that they've managed to do that\nWell let's take it one step further here because what I keep thinking about is this like right now Colorado is in the enviable position where it's elected officials are reassuring people that they're voted safe\nBut what if our systems work compromise like what if our hackers did get in somehow they'd probably catch it and they fix that but it would probably also do a number and voter confidence\nAnd officials then would be trying to rebuild trust and I think there'll be a whole lot harder\n[noise] okay ... thanks so much focus and [noise]\nWith annual minor

national tragedy just walk us through how he's been responding to this latest one well I mean listen to the energy difference between those two of you know talk\nSue soundbites you know this president when on script and he's given the words in front of him to read how he you know should sound presidential\nThen he goes and does that but you know listen to how these egged on there by the crowd that's the energy that's what fuels him that's what he thrives in and he understands the difference within himself that you know remember during the ...\nYeah and he said I could be so presidential I'd be so boring he doesn't want to be that guy and that and he is going to do everything possible to sort of fight doing that he had this habit of speaking out of two sides to that his supporters can say look he said the thing you want what else do you what else are you looking for\nI also want to ask you about a theme that's been running through these past few days in its anti Semitic conspiracy theories the mail bomb suspect sent one of his packages to George Soros the billionaire who's regularly a target of hate speech\nThere have been a number of conspiracy theories about Soros including that he's funding the migrant caravan and Central America I'm as we just heard from the last segment of Pittsburgh shooter has echoed this idea he cleaned on line that the Jews were responsible for the care of and\nWhat do you make of these theories making an appearance at both of these stories and increasingly them in the mainstream political discourse\nWell it's always been something out there and sort of the dark Web than in places you know where people are routinely harassed and it's something that Trump the White House his campaign shouldn't be sensitive to\nYou know whether inadvertently or deliberately during the campaign they ah you know wind up re tweeting white nationalist eye and instead this president\nDoubles down and you know when he feel what they're sensitive to and what she's sensitive to is how the president is treated and perceived and you know they were now pivoting to the straw man I was saying that he is not anti Semitic well that's not really what we're talking about is not about him this is about uh how the message is received\nWe're eight days now from the midterms how does all this play into people's minds that head to the ballot box or or does it at all\nWell Democrats are certainly playing up Trump's rhetoric and warning against a incivility in public life of course vice president Pence\nUh he was on a Sunday show this week and he was a arguing that the rhetoric is bad overall that Democrats say things that are bad to uh and that he has a different style that President Trump at Trump's provocative style is exactly how he connected to the American people I think that gives a degree of cover\nTo Trump's supporters to say you know look this is just something that's ginned up by the left\nAnd the media now one more thing I Want to ask you about before we let you go we heard from Hillary Clinton or in an interview with Recode a when asked about whether she would run in twenty twenty or her answer was I'd like to be president I'm kind of remarkable because you could really be considering the summit go\nWell I think she would like to be president [laughter] you know I'm not surprised by anything anymore and politics and lots of people say they're not going to run than they reconsider it if there's a groundswell of support for Hillary Clinton I'm sure she would consider it and I'm sure that looking at the twenty ... twenty twenty potential twenty twenty democratic field it's not a great\nField of candidates as far as understanding who there is no I shouldn't say that I should say that there it's not exactly clear who the potential candidate could be who would take on\nDonald Trump's so if you're a Larry Clinton's and back thinking hey I got three million are popular votes why not going to know thank you ... you're

education\nThe law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this\nYears Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it says much of a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness that then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans of best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be given for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the state but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health the on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center ... mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so\nPeople can go to our website and look in and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people out here now doubt or liberate the example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nPie cast\nNPR's WB you are I'm Robin ... now there are still more volatility on the stock market today which suggests some investors are already worried about twenty nine teen parents and the Federal Reserve's actions to increase interest rates all loom large but the biggest cause for concern is that the boost from President Trump's tax cuts\nSeem to be over just messenger is business analyst with CBS News\nJill on money and her pod cast better off high Jill hello so those tax cuts you know did make people better off the juice the economy this year on track to have the best year growth since two thousand five but ... why you know why doesn't it last\nYou know I think that the the big focus of the tax cuts this year obviously was on the corporate side those were the ones that were the permanent tax cut they were way bigger much more of the tax cut power went to companies\nAnd companies did go out and spend money and also bought back a lot of their stock and gave a bunch of dividends but they spent money it looks like that spending may have peaked in the second quarter\nAnd now it does look as though the global growth is kind of softening of bit we know China's cooling we saw some numbers today I from the government that personal incomes were just up a little bit in September that suggest that perhaps we are now peaking with consumer spending all this is kind of freaking out the investment community\nAnd making people look at twenty Nineteen\nAs genes that may be a year where we're not going to see this three or three plus percent\nGrowth and again that because we understood the jumping ... thought that these cuts would change company's long term behavior that I'm cutting that corporate income tax would make investing is so attractive that money would come in from these corporations and from overseas but it's not no\nI mean look there's part of this is that companies are long term but they're not crazy either they want to see what's going on in the economy but I think we should layer on top of that there was quite a bit of uncertainty throughout this year around tear up so we had the aluminum and steel terrorists still in place the solar panels of washing machines\nAnd this unresolved issue with China is looming quite large remember two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods we have terrorists in place those terrorists could rise from ten to twenty five percent in January\nAnd we also I hate to say this word because we haven't talked about it in a while but we have a lot of uncertainty around ... and that has really prevent that a lot of companies for making major commitments to there's more information\nAnd these tax cuts have piled on the deficit um they're expected to reach a trillion one trillion next year\nYou know Mitch McConnell the Republican leader talked about how the tax you know this a deficit increase was because of huge spending and Medicare and Social Security and saying that they had to be cuts to that to offset the um the the debt others are saying it's the tax cut would expect any of the economic consequences\nWell I mean look I'm not one of these people who I interviewed tons of economists all the times and some of them are people who think that deficit to the worst thing in the world I don't think that death is are the worst thing in the world however\nIt is mildly annoying that you have someone like McConnell start to blame the social safety net programs for a deficit one corporate tax receipts based on the left deficit numbers corporate tax receipts were down by thirty one percent\nSo yeah there is truth that the bulk of the money that goes out of the budget has to do with the safety net programs but the big change in the deficit came because of corporate tax real quick Julie got twenty seconds can these be rolled back ah probably not because they really would need to see a big gains for the Democrats in\nThe Congress and we don't have a a a veto proof majority at this point in the Congress\nFor the Democrats just us interest is Alison CBS News hosted fill a money thanks as always daycare is here now [noise]\n\nThere's a lot to consider this election season and Colorado Public
