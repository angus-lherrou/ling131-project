away from the flames I guess 'cause I was there was all me every direction I turned I was in\nIs in frames I guess 'cause\nFully engulfed in fire\nAnd I remember this guy on the\nYelling at me to get on the ground and roll and they did and ended up rolling down this hill next to the bike path there and\nHere's this poor guys just out enjoying the beautiful Sonoma County day riding his bike and next thing is he's witness to this horrific thing and he's sitting there scooping dirt off the side of the trails trying to get the fire out on me\nAnd it wasn't until the\nTrue rare name from the yard with a fire extinguisher the before the they finally got the flames out\nThey just scooped me up on the back board and\nThey had to go a long ways to get into the ER and\nWhere they were working hard I was a it was left Kerry [laughter] and uh\nWe got the ER and I was calling out orders what's in there is always there yeah I even when the nurses the patient yeah and I was telling them it's like\nYou're going to have to innovate me I took in a lot of smoke and fire\nAnd I don't know how long I always going to last you can have the enemy in a baby right away and\nThey I think we're just

colleague at the hospital Amanda is a nurse too and this co worker explains there'd been a crash Dave was alive but she should come to the hospital fast\nAnd it was July third summit county which is bursting at the scenes with traffic and people and and a lot of people have asked me what I said or what I was thinking or what I did during that drive and I honestly don't remember\nIt just now we needed to get to the hospital and when we did I I jumped out and I ran into the ER and I got into Dave's room and I took one look at him\nAnd I knew he was so badly burned\nI just looked at him and I said\nYou know uh what's\nHis core temperature how much fluid if you're given him and I just went to nursing mode and everybody was like Amanda we got we got it and uh I just stayed with him and\nEverybody was doing their job and it was an incredible feat for all those people in that year because it wasn't just day that was also Patrick and Matt and all three were critical and all these\nHealth care workers that they knew\nIt was all family taking care of family in a time of incredible crisis and I\nThought about that [noise] that\nThere's not too many times I think that you can\nLook at a situation like that for the medical team and they were all doing their job amazingly so when the helicopter came to get Dave victim to Denver and take 'em to Denver I knew\nI couldn't fly I mean I Know all about all of that but I asked anyways because I was honestly friday wasn't going to make it to Denver and I want it to be there with him\nThat wasn't an option we loaded him into

back with Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan Warner it's a survival story that makes you wonder could I have made it through what they did a flight nurse Dave rupture was burned over Ninety percent of his body after a flight for life helicopter crashed shortly after take off their shoes in Frisco in twenty Fifteen\nHis wife Amanda herself nurse learns that doctors had given him a below zero chance of survival\nMore than three years later Davis still under close medical supervision and the couple keeps the apartment they rented in Aurora to be near his doctors at CU\nA scene forty three specialties I think if the hospital forty three I didn't even know there were that now yeah I think forty two died of\nI mean I I didn't realize that are that many either I Would joke with people in the hospital I say I know there's one we're never going to hit and there'll be yeah [laughter]\nThe ruptures have kept their sense of humor their hope and they owe that partly to a burn psychologist who's worked with them as many specialists as David seen he's had even more procedures I asked him to name a few\nI don't know if it'd be easier but\nYou know we have had fifty two surgeries\nYou know fifty one yeah I think if the ones who has\nActual trips to the bar and then so he's had multiple other\nProcedures at the bedside and hundreds hundreds of things like that\nThat includes a Coakley or implants Davis on such strong antibiotics they affected his hearing but he really only started to turn a corner to feel human again after a kidney transplant\nWhy did you need a new kidney\nSo part of the burns process obviously can damage your kidneys with all the\nMaterial gets released into your blood stream and basically clogs him up and then also the ten months of antibiotics shows on so we finally got out of the hospital and can afford to coming home to the apartment\nI was doing diagnosis or the hospitals still\nAnd we're getting trained to do tell us what's at home\nThis whole apartment it was stacked the ceiling with boxes and we had the dialysis machine right next door you're sitting and\nThat was his dials yes okay I'm In the diet as a jerk rented\nIt keeps you alive but you're certainly not living in August of last year I had my transplant my health is better dramatically better my stamina is better I can be on the heat I can sweat I can drink and he was all these things was one of the biggest things that we can get\nIt meant returning to their active lifestyle even if it isn't quite like before\nSometimes it I Can't help but think when I go out and do some of these same hikes and stuff that I used to go run around and now it takes me two hours of huffing and puffing to get around you know it's just a\nThings like that I guess we've changed\nAmanda says Davis been hiking himself back to health but good health isn't the only thing they've worked for they also want justice the helicopter crash shouldn't have been as deadly and destructive as it was the fuel take the lead to David Byrnes was unnecessarily flimsy so was the seat\nThe fuel system on board was not a crash resistant fuel system\nAnd the fuel tank ruptured\nJustice explained that cold splash the day remembers feeling\nYes and and then hid basically it's like a\nBecause you're sitting right in front of its\nHis no figure then I think it was\nFrom some of this stuff was eleven millimeters thick\nAnd it's just plastic it's a run in little plastic very brittle\nAnd you're sitting right in front of it\nRemains the seat was not rated to the latest standards for crash impact it was an after market feet and David Was actually adjusted with the seat still attached to him it came off of the helicopter and he was ejected head first into the fuel spill\nIs basically built off of standards from Nineteen sixty five\nAnd that's all they had to\nDid you give it some thought\nThat your your life was changed by eleven millimeters of plastic\nThe word of use his disappointment\nYou know the people buying in developing those helicopters is just disappointing that they they knew it was out there ours wasn't the first crash\nThe FAA is known about this since the seventies sixties Vietnam War when all this technology was being developed\nIn the military was the first one to adapt most the standards\nThey realize that people were unnecessarily dying in post crash fires when they were not injured and they fixed the problem\nIn other words the crashes and the problem necessarily if the aftermath of most countries rising realization of course I mean at some point physics takes over if you ...\nCrash hard enough unfortunate things are going to\nPut all you want is a fighting chance what are you most hope for in the future or biggest hope\nOne person and that's it\nIn the future can walk away from something like this\nWe hope it'd be more than that\nA lot of people need to take a little more responsibility for this\nIndustry needs to change their behavior the regulators need to change their behavior\nThere needs to be greater awareness amongst the people getting into these helicopters and\nYou know it's not just their medical errors companies in the Grand Canyon that are flying six hundred thousand people a newly\nWith these same kinds of things you will to helicopters\nSightseeing news Hawaii the ... yeah it is Philip ... the U.S utilize is the most helicopters\nIn the world and people have no idea what they're stepping into [noise]\nBoth\nAs for what caused the crash federal investigators said it was likely are preventable hydraulic issue the ruptures sued the manufacturer Airbus and the operator error methods\nAnd eventually settled for a hundred million dollars the couple will use some of the money for a new foundation partly to help other burns survivors but the settlement will also pay for Dave's lifelong medical\nCare who wouldn't wish disappoint anyone but\nSeeing how people can come together when they really want to it's been\nBeen really special it's straight strangers\nWe're the ones in July parade in Frisco and a woman that we didn't recognize came up and just had tears in her eyes and say can I ask you both and she gave us both a hunch thing I pray for you both everyday and you're just amazing and I mean what do you do with that except share and pay it forward and [noise]\n\n\nUh listen to us from Denver and CPR split all resource for our community just because it helps us to be better informed and helps us to better understand current issue so that's why I get to CPR when you should get to see ... ...\nHi this is rainy I live in Greenwich Village and I love Colorado Public radio and I support because it's where I go to learn it's where I go to fall in love

Washington Post congressional reporter Paul welcome to you hey that around me and told me to start with you because your paper has been reporting deeply on your ...\nA columnist for the paper let's listen to what the president said yesterday in the office in the oval office when asked about the Saudis\nThey're spending a hundred and ten billion dollars purchasing military equipment and other things we don't show it to they'll say well thank you very much will live from Russia for thank you very much will buy from China\nThat was kind of a wins moments hole for some people uh you know putting business deals ahead of human rights and your paper's also reporting about Trump's personal deals with the Saudis say for instance they're booking in his hotels ... your sense of how that moment went over\nA I think it went over to lead balloon up on Capitol Hill they had a bipartisan\nJust dispute was Trump how you handled it uh they were only a few votes short of blocking the Saudis

away and if a leadership sort of breaks than you could really see a big sweeping vote or against Saudi Arabia\nWill haunt us commerce and the Associated Press um as all this was swirling the questions about why are we going to put pressure on the Saudis with turkey saying that this happened in the end the conflict that he was murdered\nAnd as you know speaking of swirling Michael hurricane Michael was swirling towards the Carolinas leading devastation in the in its path\nIn Florida the president had lunch with Kanye West now normally this would seem like a silly thing but it wasn't in the middle of this huge news cycle I'm let's just I I Want to see how this fits in get your opinion on that on he where he was wearing his make America great again red hat\nAnd he went on a you know several minute long um defense of his friendship with President Trump Trump dropping the F bomb in the oval office on one occasion once was into a little\nScary to ... but it's\n\nReal my dad and my mom's side have metal in my home and also a ... a\nNew one on one\nOf the summers they went on for quite a long time or at one point he embraced the president left across the desk to embrace him I thought oh my God the secret service might have had a heart attack at that moment um make because the split screen showed the devastation of hurricane\nYeah you know the president at one point during a Kanye West extended monologue he stopped for a second he said you know that was quite something I'd have to say I agree this was a really fascinating split screen I think one thing that's important to keep in mind is while you have these chew kind of men who were born of reality t._v. and the starlight and the conversation\nAnd the surreal kind of moment they were also talking about policy we heard them in the conversation\nTalking about manufacturing gangs prison reform you heard Kanye West actually contradict the president's statements from earlier this month about the controversial stop and frisk policy and whether or not that would actually be useful in the city of Chicago which is we was we all know struggled with crime I Do think though that we're still seeing what the death toll will be\nA part of the hurricane we've already within a number of men reported dead now some really striking images of devastation we're also twenty five days out from the mid term elections the idea that the president sitting down with someone like Kanye West I think is very very interesting and strategically\nWell it talk just briefly about that because we heard many African American voices going on the cable shows um decrying it because well in Don Lemon from CNN said it was a minstrel show 'em they feel that it's a a black man being used\nBy President Trump there are others who have spoken up and said hey here's a guy he has a right to as African Americans we have the right to make our own decisions about\nWho we are for or against what's your sense of how that might have resonated because in the past the President Trump is held up Kanye West as an example of how he appeals to the African American community\nHe has and I think that we have to look at that against the backdrop of some of the things the president said about his support among African Americans he has claimed falsely on a number of occasions that he is one more\nBlack voters and Republican Republican presidents and candidates in the past and that that's just simply not the case he's also make lanes as my colleague Erin whack reported this week\nAbout having made the black unemployment rate at its lowest ever and while the unemployment rate among African Americans has dropped whether or not that it's all attributable to the Trump presidency is something different question I think most economists would disagree dropped even further during the Obama in ... yeah yeah so I think that\nThe idea that ... because the president is sitting down with Kanye West that he would suddenly gained more African American ships\nSupporters or when more African American voters who had a Republican candidates I think that there's there there have not facts to back up that I'd say ... yeah\nI Want to bring in what's going on with the stock market this week because you know that could be an issue in the midterms as well especially in terms of what it says about the broader economy yesterday on Fox and friends President Trump once again criticized the federal\nFor raising interest rates three times so far this year and that's one of the reasons why the stock market was going down this week\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all this that's ridiculous what they're doing\nPaul thoughts how this will affect them in terms\nOf the reality is they've you know the economy has just not played a big role in this election it is\nIt is doing well um you know uh but whether it's better than the improving it a better rate than under Obama that's all up in the air but the reality is their economy is doing well but it still hasn't been a big issue for Republicans on the positive level um\nSo I don't know what the stock market or if it continues to crash was whether that would then create another bad at a un sentiment it's really hard to know because it's just been a weird election in which the cultural issues keep dominating and overcoming anything to do with the economy\nHere I said this last friday and I said again just a few weeks ago\nA an anonymous member claiming to be well the times also claimed it was a member of the top administration rather than an letter in the New York times saying that they were you know they were running the show and that\nA President Trump could not and that's gone you know from our conversation but ensuring into the conversation is weakest civility um after the brutal bruising Kavanaugh battle Republicans left on leapt on Hillary Clinton for saying this on CNN\nIf we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect his strength\nAnd then you had former Obama attorney general Eric Holder kind of making a play on Michelle Obama's twenty sixteen monitor\nSays if you don't when they go low we [noise] they go low we hold or\nLater clarified he said no we just have to be strong that's that we don't physically hurt somebody but Trump foreign holder better be careful for what he wishes for well the right of seizing on this one I Want to they're just seizing on this as an example of how it's the Democrats\nThat are being uncivil in what some saw as you know Brett Kavanaugh actually being the attack dog uh during the confirmation hearings\nDefinitely right we've heard a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill make this argument right particularly about the protests an uproar around Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings they talked about being shouted out of restaurants having people shut their doors one Republican member of Congress talking about\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and this of course was popular courses or a computer science courts that it has actually Hackett bombs were the students are scheduled to work all night as part of the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean the football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights\nJust after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled in many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say eight o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is a set up for the students staying up all night\nLong extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that keeping kids\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock sends the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution ah we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brain send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside\nAnd when we decide to switch off so much\nWell there's that we we talked about some of the health issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough re read Matthew walkers terrific book why we sleep which is now out in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and death well\nAny Matthew walkers book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nAnd ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not mentioned diabetes are you interested in locally sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you know ...\nI mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you convey this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on their sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the\nTurn time and swimming they can get more\nComing all free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep that consistency in the timing of sleep apnea so students have irregular schedules there too as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we studied Harvard students we found\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six than biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or where they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWow so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am I right\nSo when I have a teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the summer have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity and the first\nA schedule activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working with talking to you most specifically about students but you've got to sleep matters initiative on bringing on Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters who took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury used have as many disability days I mean you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now dot org\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shifts there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we met at a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour canoe in detail so we did a sleep disorder screening for example\nFor ten minutes they filled out a few a validated questionnaires away identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders in order for them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women have sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep is you can't breathe and sleep at the same time\nYou're not going to get the rest of that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them they made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the sessions are are getting everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session that's on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people\nHave this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep with him because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death but four hundred and twenty percent than we've had\nAmazing feedback from people say oh my God this this change my whole life my depression was resolved and he's still medications anymore my marriage I came back to the other it can really have a major impact\nAnd all we provide people as information and a screening\nBut what if you just you know you want to sleep more and you just you you put your head down you can't\nSort of people with chronic insomnia let's say one thing that they can do which is quite effective is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia that can be done on line one program is called sleep your nose is called shut eye\nThese are interactive programs again that help identify sleep Steelers and the environment that and that's part of our education program to you know I Love dogs for example but uh we have to but they don't belong in the bad things as they they're quite disruptive to sleep and so so there are a lot of tips that are providing a cat [laughter] right [laughter]\nAlcohol interferes with sleep so every shot it takes two hours to metabolize or a glass of wine and then there are some new technologies there's a new product called ... which is is kind of like a little hadn't been which actually does bring pooling to help people with chronic insomnia or get to sleep faster and that's just been approved by the after\nI'm writing sleepy ... with the letter I an ab ... again will not that I Would need this of course not necessarily [laughter]\nJust terrific Dr Charles Czeisler who teaches asleep at Harvard University which is also offering online courses to all the students now he's also behind the seat matters initiatives at\nBrigham and Women's Hospital where he's chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders thanks so much for being thank you I really try\nAnd have a lot of links haven't even talked about it here now dot org and by the way that the size of all those who also tells us and if you're taking over the counter melatonin he believes it doesn't work out to sleep but there are some things in the pipeline that will have to talk about that\nYou know to the students is here now [noise]\nHi my name is ... I'm from Denver, Colorado and supporting CPR is important to me because I listen to it pretty much every day is done most of my day in a car and flipping back between open air the news\nTakes up most of my day and I always find new and interesting music and um love the news that CPR covers and so that's why I decided to donate Katie\nFrom Lakewood and today sporting CPR for a couple of reasons the first was reflecting on how many conversations I when I was listening to the PR I that I heard on NPR laying", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "12"}
