of the key things is the great companies are thinking about how we transform the world how are we making the world better and that's both ups and downs and one of the things that we have a whole chapter on this in the book is that as your scaling really fast as you're running this past weekend on the road be thinking about which possible risk you're taking that you need to mitigate\nPossible

C. American farmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute\nBut last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nAssessment is fresh fruit acting as and all All right that's what [noise] way our unleashing the power of the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa to morning play good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that so\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sale of all kinds of gasoline called E. Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes to have it completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no relief that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight and I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a I was governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president and she worked changing plenty of compliments with each other also the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against is myth though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil\nAnd so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in an energy they're more interested in in oil Clay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality his state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help matching on election day here's West Virginia public radio their message\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n[noise]\nThen they showed it on order and\nBy that evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston in the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office\nMiller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says she was attentive and listen to their concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you will do on election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but\nI had that for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about that today I'll\nTurn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognized that mentioned is new liberal but his defended him in the\nPast I have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Ireland so she won't vote for mentioned in November Emily comer came to a similar decision she's a public schoolteacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion commercial leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Marcy either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that it's going to fight for us\nAll three women so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with is more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate for my computer that voting record is a sign that mentioned is an independent thinker can put it was a democratic state lawmaker for mentions home in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted him to do and and and they did they acted accordingly\nOr some people just don't be happy about that and some just want to be mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree a hundred percent of the time with anybody\nBut computers has mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or not affiliated voters with his vote for cabinet\nIncluded believes mansion has certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote for cabin all that they abandoned him or if they want to continue the state's tradition of sending moderate Democrats to Washington for NPR News I'm Dave
