sports gambling 'em and dedicated to infrastructure improvements in I'm advocating for that could you do that with the legislatures help simply say that money will go here the absolute over and there is that there'll be legal challenges like there always are about whether it's a tax or a feat but that is an example to dedicated source of revenue\nAnd whether there would have to then be a vote under the desk their bill of rights okay and to the idea of attainable housing what role can a governor play into that\nA couple of different roles um I think state government can be a valuable catalyst\nFor creating more housing give us a supply and demand problem is somebody who has a background in economics it's a simple supply and demand problem um but we haven't done a good job of fixing it first of all I think we need a meaningful construction defects reform that we have not had and that includes the right to cure\nFor a builder over a Ninety or a hundred and twenty day period if what they say they don't have that if you had acted out he's right there because we're living in well and and if you're building Ryan at three hundred unit condo development chances are you're going to find a wire that's misplaced in the bathroom the developers should be able to cure that over and now you're a hundred and twenty day period without the threat of litigation\nAnd that has stifled or the development if you look at what's happening in Denver for instance uh last year we had about half the residential condo permits pulled and we had ten years ago even though the population has gone up\nBy more than a million people that's number one number two is I think the governor can work with ... on the tax credit process to Colorado is a ... yeah this is Ari\nColorado housing and finance on the tax credit program which is somewhat antiquated which is ... very badly backlog so that if developers willing to put a portion of\nHis or her development towards affordable housing they can have as fast ineffective\nAnd approval process as possible very briefly what evidence do you have the construction defects reform will actually unleash the condo market the evidence that I have is that if\nWe meaningfully fixed it I think that we would have happened we would have more supply on market because that's not as it ended as what you think that's I think that that's that is anecdotal evidence of a problem not being fixed\nI think that a lot of condo developers are not developing because of the threat in fear of lawsuits\nAnd a lot of the legislation has unfortunately been watered down by different interests homebuilders versus condo builders and I think it's absolutely the case that we would have more condos being built if we remove the threat\nOf litigation on this subject of gross Denver's a finalist for Amazon's second headquarters which would bring an estimated fifty thousand workers to the area do you want Amazon here yes or no I'd like to

make us competitive and I think that there's deep and large questions around whether whether I could answer yes\nTo that question um but in a perfect world what I like them you're absolutely a day or a high paying jobs they stimulate uh our economic growth there a catalyst to economic growth and I'm not for us giving Amazon handouts but I'm for them getting the exact same tax credits that businesses\nThat are of a smaller a medium size nature uh would receive\nMy guess is the Republican candidate for Colorado Governor Walker Stapleton\nWill take a break but before we do something to clarify he said under President Trump's tax cuts that someone who are in sixty thousand dollars would see their tax bill shrink from Seventeen hundred dollars to just one hundred we found an example

I'm Ryan mortar for a century people in southern Colorado voted mostly for Democrats that changed in the last presidential election why well many voters said they felt forgotten by leaders who were too focused on urban and suburban communities\nIt's the focus of the latest purplish podcast from CPR news about Colorado's political identity here is host San brash\nDrive south of Denver on twenty

[noise]\nAfter a while there is one thing you might notice\nA steel door with a handle lives flat against the ground [noise]\nHappened beneath this store it helps explain decades of politics in

fourteen\nWith the largest ... in this area because that was the maternity pet people were staying in these tents for up to Fifteen months during the strike and women went into this bigger tip to give birth\nMore than a thousand miners and their families lived on this site back then coal mining was huge down here in Los Angeles and ... counties but conditions were terrible and pay was low so miners walked off the job\nThe company called in the national guard\nAnd then one day in December violence erupted [noise]\nOn the day of the massacre it was chaotic there are people with rifles and both sides but\nThe national guard had a machine gun they opened fire on the strikers guardsmen burned the camp to the ground [noise]\nNo one knew those children and women were in that [noise] and so they suffocated there [noise]\n\nAbout two dozen people died in what came to be known as the Ludlow Massacre the event marked a turning point in the fight for better wages and working conditions and there's another reason but most important the local politics changed\nThe miners turned I Would say against the Republican Party and became more democratic\nAnd for a long long time that's the way it was my name's slowed down big time after World War two\nBut steel mills and manufacturing in southern Colorado continued to ensure that labor was a big player here and where you have labor unions you have Democrats the Democratic party ran the show for decades the one that party's primary you pretty much won the election\nBut here's the thing the Democrats hold on the area is not what it used to be\nWhen ever people are just contented live their lives and people are just contended in southern Colorado because of the lack of opportunity and jobs and then people tend to look\nAt another political party\nAnd that's exactly what happened in twenty sixteen many counties in southern Colorado voted for now President Trump in some cases it was the first time they'd flipped read in decades [noise]\nAlmost immediately people cited southern Colorado as a western example of the rust belt effect after years of steady support for Democrats blue collar workers found something attractive in

fewer steel jobs but everybody I talked to brought up the steel mill whether asked him about it or not\nIn Portland was definitely contested real estate in twenty sixteen how did the presidential

election Clinton won Colorado by five points but in ... county it was too close to call on election night\nDemocratic Party leaders are still reeling from the news that many in the party crossed over\nTrump narrowly won the county by less than one percentage point and this is a huge departure from twenty twelve when President Obama won the county by fourteen points this means clearly there

Kathy guns to an fried chicken coming up here in the news is first\nFrom NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie line can President Trump is answering reporters' questions from the White House Rose Garden after announcing that the U.S and Canada have reached a new trade ...\nNow the U.S Mexico Canada agreements replaces the north American free trade agreement\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nTrump says he and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts plan to sign it by the end of November it would then be submitted to Congress for approval or early next year\nThe president has also been fielding questions about sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd while the president is telling reporters today that he wants the FBI to do a wide ranging and comprehensive investigation NPR's Windsor Johnston reports new questions are emerging about how the probe is actually being conducted\nSome democratic lawmakers are accusing the White House said trying to micromanage and limit the scope of the investigation Delaware Senator Chris Coons tells NPR the pro that should be broader\nIt's got to have opportunities for the FBI to follow up on things that were obviously before us documents for example like the calendar that judge Kavanaugh put forward I Would expect the FBI would be able to then go interview people who appeared on that counter\nThe White House says the FBI has a full rein to investigate whatever it wants Senate Republicans had given the agency a week to review the allegations before moving ahead with a full vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation Windsor Johnston NPR News

supported her dairy farmers they're going to be happy for supporters work in the car manufacturing industry I'm sure they're going to be happy I'm you know in terms of the biggest losers here it's not entirely clear I I think that people who support Donald Trump\nIt has been shown in poll after poll they basically support him no matter what\nAnd this isn't a bad trade deals ... it's it's a it's a fine trade deal it's just extremely subtle compared with the criticisms that Trump had for the previous trade deal and it should be said that in twenty sixteen as a part of the TPP a negotiations the Trans Pacific partnership\nNegotiations Obama's team was negotiating with Canada and Mexico and actually extracted many of the execs\nPaying benefits that Trump has now extracted from this country is in twenty Eighteen\nAnd so I think the confusion here for a lot of economists said if you're going to take Trump's seriously when he criticizes NAFTA and when he pulls out of TPP if you did in his first week as president is\nIf your if there was all this bluster about how bad these trade agreements are and then two years later you're basically just reenacting them and putting a new name on it than what exactly we've been talking about for the last year and a half\nWell what does it mean for the manufacturing industry in this country which President Trump has been focused on since before he became president he's been telling people in a lot of states in the Midwest especially that you know we're going to bring your jobs back we're going to the manufacturing industry in this country is gonna boom again\nRight on the one hand it's important to hit the steel tariffs remain in place\nOr they might open up more negotiations in the future with Canada ... but for now the steel tariffs remain in place and that's something that these steel manufacturing industry quite legs but whenever we're talking about manufacturing it's important to say let's define what a comeback is in Nineteen Seventy nine there were twenty million manufacturing workers\nWhen Trump became president there were twelve point three million now there's twelve point seven million right so we've added four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in the last Eighteen months that's not bad manufacturing jobs are coming back but we're never going to have anything close to the Nineteen seventies economy again\nAnd so you know when I talk to economists about you know how do you plan the economy the future they say well planned for the economy\nOf the future don't try to create the conditions to to grasp for the economy that we had in Nineteen Seventy nine and so it just seems like there's an enormous amount of effort being placed on creating conditions for the revitalization of a tiny tiny part of the U.S economy which isn't steel manufacturing\nWhen in fact we were just in Indiana a recently doing some reporting on manufacturing there and one of the problems that they say that they have in the industry there is that we've got the jobs we just don't have workers that are trained to do\nThe new manufacturing jobs dark or just in the thirty seconds that we have left here what do you think that this news about the U.S when we called us MCA us there ... or what does that mean for countries that the U.S government is\nStill in sort of trade disputes with thinking about the European Union in particular\nThe European Union and China ah you know if this gift Trump confidence that history strategy is working that might embolden him\nTo hold out on China um it might involved and then to hold out on the European Union is well on the other hand if you take the outcome at this negotiation on his face then you say Trump is going to have a lot of bluster there's going to be a lot of criticism of the status quo but you're going to end up with\nThe status quo I mean to be clear us MCA NAFTA two point oh or whatever you call it it's basically exactly what the Obama administration had a toward the end of twenty sixteen and so if that's your precedent then you're going to end you're going to have a lot of last year but I end up essentially where we were two years\nThere Thompson senior
