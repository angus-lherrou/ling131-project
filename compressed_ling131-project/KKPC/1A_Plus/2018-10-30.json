found a supportive community at the tree of life synagogue rabbi checked diamond who once led the congregation remembers that brothers as a constant presence at services and steady groups\nThat I give my study group at the end of the you're say a prayer book as a present and they were carried around with them wherever they want and they're very proud of it they brought a lot of joy that were full of love and they really had a um presence but community in general the Jewish community and they will be missed by by all of us\nServices for the rest of the victims will be held throughout the week Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\nAnd well some people say they would support a visit from President Trump others say just the opposite side accusing him of fomenting messages that hate protesters are preparing for President Trump's visit to Pittsburgh\nThe president says he is considering in order to end the constitutional right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S two parents who are not us citizens\nNPR's Joel Rose reports Trump has tried to make his immigration crackdown the focus of next week's mid term elections\nTrump made the remarks in an interview with ...\nWith the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to end in\nFact more than thirty countries around the world offer birthright citizenship\nThe fourteenth amendment to the constitution guarantees the right to citizenship for all children born in the U.S when pressed on whether he can change that Trump says quote there saying I can do it just with an executive order unquote\nThough it's not clear when or if Trump would issue such an order if he does it will certainly spark a legal battle the full interview airs this weekend on ... on HBO Joel Rose NPR News\nIt's nearly midnight in Indonesia with no rest for the many searchers scouring the job is safe for victims of Monday's plane crash a lion airplane was carrying one hundred eighty nine people when it crashed shortly after takeoff\nSo far at least twenty four bodies have been recovered from the waters there remains has been transferred to Jakarta for identification as NPR's Julie McCarthy tells us is very little hope that anyone could have survived this crash\nEmployment and so on and education and learning English and those who are coming here as a means of making a quick buck before ... going across the border and so on and feeling that we have lost the appetite as a society to really take on those hard challenges\nI mean I can imagine that she feels a in a way politically homeless Mm\n[noise] yeah she's deeply frustrated by both parties and I'm sure she'll vote this election and I'm sure that she'll vote 'em for a Democrat but she'll do so with strong reservations let's talk\nMore about immigration I think that's a an issue that that is certainly top of mind right now with ah the focus on the so called caravan uh and uh now the question of whether you should be a citizen if you are born in the United states on on this and\nHow did you sense out people's deep feelings about an issue like immigration\nBy asking them about their parenting style for instance ... help us understand how you've tried to get a fuller picture of the electorate and if these as you call them hidden tribes\nWell first we got a lot of breath so we ask questions about sanctuary cities we ask questions about a border wall we ask questions about the contributions and immigrants make to society so we asked all the questions you ask an ordinary question if you're trying to understand people's\nPerception of immigrants because one of the things we learned from that especially in the in depth interviews is that people always started by drawing the distinction between people who've come here legally is intending to become an American citizen and people who come here with undocumented status [noise]\nThen after all that Brett we analyze that along what we can refer to adapt which as understanding people's moral values their parenting styles their identity [noise]\nOne of the things that was really telling from doing that is that especially as you move move to the right on the spectrum people really identify with Being American it's a source of enormous pride to them\nThey might say that they're an American before they say that they are Christian it's how they wake up in the morning they feel like there's a culture and a history there that they really embody and care about as you move to the left people have increasingly say that they feel a bit of shame about America and its past and they don't identify with Being American as a central part of who they are\nNot to mention is a really important facet of the conversation about immigration because the the categories that were afraid to citizen and non citizen and have a lot more relevance to some people than others\nAnd that touches on patriotism for sure and and even the use of that word in our youth patriotic and you'll find that to be very strong among traditional conservatives and devoted to conservatives less strong among progressive activists in traditional liberals\nIt's so interesting how that ensure plays with President Trump's message of make America great again and\nI mean in a way it seems contradictory if you've got the conservatives who vote for him saying America's great now I'm I'm proud of American now\nMhm [noise] yeah I think there is a sense um among especially the devoted conservatives these are the most\nFiercely loyal to Trump that today being an American citizen your rights are less valued than those of an immigrant they really believe that strongly it's one of the things that distinguishes and the most from your kind of traditional conservative\nAnd so they have a sense that society has kind of come to seek revenge against the traditional white conservative ... I'm American um and that they are now turning the tables against them\nTo Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're talking about a new study of the hidden tribes of America it is an effort from a group called more in common to bring more nuance\nTo polarization in this country my guest is Steven Hawkins who is research director for more income in this group that works to reduce polarization in democracies and uh we've talked at the same about how core beliefs shape our political identities\nIt's a great a great starting point is that message being sent from the top of government though\nNot from the White House I Would say that we do not have we have 'em too much bombastic and self aggrandizing speech from the White House not setting the right tone thanks for being with us we it's the tip of the iceberg fascinating stuff Steven\nThank you so much for having me Steven Hawkins of Denver is research director for more in common which fights polarization and he is lead author of hidden

thirty years ago anyone could live in Boulder and that's not the case anymore\nWhen you make the move to a Grand Junction do you expect to step into the same kind of cycling advocacy leadership that you've taken out in Boulder\nI Hope so um I don't want to be because I don't want to be called that Boulder guy so I'm going to be taking baby steps in the beginning um but I Do want to get involved with cycling community out there I'm great the great thing about Grand Junction is you know they have natural beauty um there's great places to ride already so um I Do hope to be involved in out there\nHow do you become an agent of change and inject some Boulder into Grand Junction but not be the pushy guy from Boulder who wants to make over Grand Junction\nI think we can do that we're bringing you know a lot of young rest of the people with us and I think when we have when I started with ... boots on the ground you know we'll have more people I'm from the front range visiting because we're you know more of like a a beach head for a lot of the cycling industry now they're\nA beach I'd say more about that well we'll have a building up um you know we have a lot of contacts in the front range we had a really good reputation in the front range so when people come through Grand Junction hopefully they'll come come to Grand Junction set of through Grand Junction um they'll ... they'll basically have a place to go now\nYou used the word progressive that's kind of a loaded term\nThese days and they're obviously big political differences as well between Boulder and Grand Junction ah I think that is a much more conservative part of the state ... ... talk to me about how that played into your decision and what the perception is in Boulder have you moving your company Rocky Mountain west\nOkay so I'm In graduate there's definitely a little more red in Boulder I'm being sarcastic and saying that but I realized the little um or being as the ... the uh you know it's a big oil and gas out there but the good thing about Grand Junction is you know Seventy five percent of its ... there's a lot of room to spread out\nSo some of the problems we have in I'm In the front range like you just spoke about the fracking problem comes from too many people in ... to ... to concentrated area out there there's a lot of room to spread out um I I understand what the oil and gas guys do I do drive a car and you get on airplanes I Do new fuel so I can respect but they do and I understand it and I think they have a good balance of it out there\nWhat what's the reaction in Boulder to moving Rocky Mountains to Grand Junction\nAbout what the hell's wrong with you this was one of them um everyone was shocked um I was really surprised you know we had a lot of press on it and I know a lot of people in the community so I'd run into people and they're like I Can't believe you're leaving 'em because I've done a lot of work in that community I'm pretty well known 'em and it was a it was a shock to a lot of people that we were just pick up and leave what do you think\nPrompted them to say that but we'll find that are you crazy sort of idea\nI think people are just so used to seeing us seeing our car racks I'm seeing my my activity in the cycling me there I'm I'm a fixture in that community and just to sort of rip off and remove that to these Pete to that community is a big deal\nWe spent ah just under a week in Grand junction a earlier this summer reporting on the fact that a lot of people are moving there from the front range who are tired of the crowds here and the traffic\nAnd the cost of living for that matter a I remember meeting a teardrop trailer manufacturer who relocated his business from the front range\nTo Grand Junction very similar I think to your story talk about maybe some of the economic pressures on the front range that informed this decision to move to the western slope\nSo we could have pulled something off in Boulder it would not have been would not have been pretty and it'll be financial leverage the rest of my life\nI did have a a deal on the table I tried to get going an eerie I'm didn't pan out\nA city or he didn't want me and then I had a deal on the table or in city Lewis fill in an office park and uh the process to get through um the building putting the building up with the St Louis built in Boulder County is very difficult and very expensive with sewer taffy water taffy impact these schedule fees was a full page long [noise]\nUm so I called city Grand Junction because we need to be on a transfer transportation network and I love the riding out there\nOn ... on I Seventy yeah so we have rail line there we got the highway there Salt Lake so it's a great transportation network which we need 'em and uh when I went out to a Grand Junction um\nThe people in the front range all the communities and all the cities were basically telling me to get in line to get your checkbook out and get mine\n... Grand Junction wanted us and they're building a really great public park right in the Colorado River with a commercial lots and we were I'm fortunate enough to get one of those so we located in our business to I'm\nA park right in the Colorado River which is to give away from Grand Junction no not at all um what they're doing is they want to diversify their economy out there because it was based on heavily on oil and gas or they want to attract outdoor wreck\nIt has been very susceptible to booms and busts yes it has so they do need to diversify their economy so they're they put this park up um and it's it's great the way they did it there's a [noise]\nIt's about forty acres and most of the land is right on the rivers for the public and then serves heading north I'm away from the river there's a commercial lots are using for outdoor Iraq so the first two companies going where bombs I designed was the first one who's a visionary the park in the Rocky Mountains was the second\nBonds identifies zip lines and sort of outdoor playgrounds ah speaking again to this idea that ... the diversification of the economy in Grand junction is very much to do with the outdoors industry\nYes exactly I'm In the city Grand Junction realize that end up I mean it was it was a we're so fortunate slammed into this with the city I'm the mayor even said after they voted on a proposal um Rocky Mountain exactly the kind of company we won Grand Junction\nNear listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we are speaking with Bobby noise who's the founder and owner of Rocky Mountains a Boulder bike rack and lock company\nHe's picking up and moving to Grand Junction a that is part of a trend or as Grand Junction looks to diversify its economy and frankly lore businesses they're even from within Colorado\nSo I think you have twelve employees yes now and are are most of them moving with you will probably get about half about half\nHow was that conversation with the employees\nIt's interesting um a lot of people I'm excited about the move some people have children and they can't pick up and move and I respect that and understand that so I've been open and transparent with everyone\nThe interesting thing is um we knew some hiring lately and we're only gonna hire people that will move the Grand Junction with us so I had a couple of ads out on indeed in Craig's list and one of the requirements was you have to move the Grand Junction with us\nAnd I was amazed I got fifty resumes for one position and uh everyone told me the same story of these guys I was interviewing excuse me men and women I was interviewing they said I moved to Colorado for the cycling the fly fishing um skiing and they said all I Do is sit in traffic all day and this is not why I moved to Colorado is this is a great opportunity for me\nIt sounds to me like this this is about growth for you in other words ... growth was just not as possible along the front range as it is on the western slope\nYeah well we've always been hamstrung by real estate costs in Boulder um if we want to be more warehouse space is really expensive the we'd guys really drove up the price of warehousing in Boulder so we never had excess capacity sorghum and tore now in Grand junction there's a lot more real estate available to us it's formal so we can actually grow the business now\nWhat would you say this is an awfully big question here or what would you say is the state of cycling right now in Colorado what space is at occupy I don't know like recreationally but also as a means of getting around not just for fun\nUm so it's for the recreational aspect it's doing well the roads are getting crowded and you see a lot of people getting off road bikes Roebuck sales are down there riding gravel bikes in mountain bikes more\nUm some of the recreational side the mailbox off is growing which is great a gravel growing in the road seems to be declining a little bit interesting um and then from the commuting aspect um I see some of those problems there's more people here I think people are riding bikes more you know the state's been great about\nIn bike protected bike lanes I'm so to cycling commuting is growing the struggles I see is that there's more traffic on the road and a lot of people are scared to ride their bikes thanks for being with us through pre share perspective like humor document much Bobby Knight is the founder and owner of Rocky Mount ...
