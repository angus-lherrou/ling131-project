Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and I teach this I lecture on this\nAny sort of doubt you might have had about his technique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything they can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put him back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of that but tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen or another accuser has come forward that same her name is Rachel ... and she also comes forward publicly in a a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police detective ... bird and she definitely takes a different approach\nOr she is working ... name of his own\nGoals you know that was in junior will never do that sort of characters originally wrote his religion if I've kind of history is not a huge pushing off to the sunrise rated her\nLook I um\nI guess what I'm saying what you're describing to me is very different than how she describes in her ...\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest were the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an for comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records\nAnd so ... believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on\nNassau it's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nThere was a arousal was is is\nVery much because of for her whole are much larger world [noise] middle of a year in Russia your immune voter which is\nActually what you know you're just saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea I'm an for one of whom she talks about looking back at the interviews that she herself\nWas kind of unsure why NASA our we have so much trouble answering such a simple questions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his answer he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least hearing the victim out yeah\nWell I mean fundamentally this is how guys like this operate is they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just this great guy could be hurting somebody as humans were not good at thinking that can happen to that\nPeople that we work with or who are family but the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and can fail these women and girls for so long [noise]\nKate Wells and Lindsey Smith are hosts of the new podcast believed from Michigan Radio and NPR thank you both so much\nThanks now while out things you have an act [noise]\n\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News our theme music was written by BJ Lederman an arranged by Jim Pew I'm Noel King and I'm Rachel Martin [noise]\n\nYou're listening to end up news from Colorado Public radio or Ninety One FM Casey afar Denver fourteen Ninety am K.

with W GBH Boston and supported by the human kind program fun\nIt is easier than at any time in our history to build a healthy diet if you look for\nAnd if you're going to take the time to prepare food but it's also the case that it's never been easier to build an unhealthy diet as well because unhealthy a food is so easily available at so inexpensive it's a it's literally every corner and so I think that's the challenge that we face [noise]\nEasily overlooked link between the foods we choose to eat and how else do we feel you're listening to humankind special I'm doing good for you [noise]\nIt's an obvious some them sometimes disregard to our detriment fuel we put into our bodies the foods we eat have a profound impact on our health point\nOf view on on ... to fend off disease and won't physicians are aware of the connection between diet and we'll get surprisingly short shrift in medical school\nBut a growing movement among doctors just trying to please greeter\nPriority on the rule of nutrition and nor will be one of hinder at a recent medical conference in Boston summarized the dilemma so many of us face\nI grew up on certain comfort food good now I Know or maybe aren't so healthy for me [noise]\nUh but I still likes along so what do you do\nThe foods we choose play a huge role in our risk of obesity many forms of heart disease diabetes or susceptibility to cancer and other chronic conditions\nAnd it's not just intake of too many foods that can cause harm is also not getting enough for the foods that nature has been dealt with protective anti disease effects physicians Sarah Rice of family medicine doctor from Bainbridge Island Washington counsels patients about healthy eating\nI give them a handout because I found when I Would just say it out loud it would go right through them so I send them home with something\nAnd I try to go over it every time I see them\nAnd I tried it just reiterate my point\nWhat specifically argue urging them to consider [noise]\nUm [noise] the biggest thing I tell people and I to tell them to make one lifestyle change it to increase their fruit and vegetable intake if they cannot do anything else to do that and why is that so important it's simple straightforward available and pretty easy\nNot to mention delicious not to mention delicious [laughter]\nThen of course we choose what to eat in the context of the culture we live in ... typically in Manchester New Hampshire specializes in treating children for ...\nSocietal issue I'm seeing an individual within a much bigger picture\nWho is pressuring each and every day\nTo make choices which are not in their best interests [noise]\nAnd is that a product of the marketing of\nIt's a product of the marketing it's a product of of ah [noise]\nThe way foods are manufacturing what's the cheapest what's the most available what's the most cost effective\nA including at Harvard Medical school where the vegetables were just horrible\nSo people kind of been turned off by their experience with food's not well enough prepared\nYeah the other thing I Want to say uh in addition to antioxidants is um minerals you know vegetables or your best source of minerals and the\nDiet um we know that in the United states people most people don't get enough potassium they don't get enough magnesium and this could be remedied by eating enough vegetables um I Know I crave vegetables I really uh crave a salads I crave a\nA well prepared a roasted vegetables um and um people\nHaven't been taught to cook in general and cooking vegetables as maybe a little harder than cooking steak can really put salt and pepper and you put it on the grill and it's probably going to be at a bowl and then you may have similar ... or ... or something like that that you could add to it [noise]\nUm and I do think there's a little bit more knowledge required to a preparer vegetables in a tasty way a but it's very very little\nIf we do adjuster food preparation habits to incorporate more vegetables and fruits for health is there not also risk of harmful effects from pesticides and other chemicals used in crops that are grown non organically physician Eliot Cohen based in Princeton New Jersey\nI work with and many populations and not just people who can afford organics I work and it says you economically challenged communities and mothers and families that do not have access or finances or even the knowledge regarding some of these choices\nSo I actually tried to make sure that people have options other than organics\nUm I certainly think that that's the best way to go you can do that and there's even frozen organics now that are cheaper than fresh organics that are just as good you know nutrient life [noise]\nUm but I I also recommend people I'm looking into other resources like environmental working cribs dirty dozen clean to team which is a wonderful resource\nUm which shows you know yearly it's an annual on evaluation of\nUnconventional which means non organic produce um and whether or not they have the greatest amount of pesticide residues versus that we can out and it said that not that list changes up every year but generally carry some of the same ... tend to be the highest in terms of the most recipes\nUm tested yearly um so that's one option for people who can't afford to have no access to organic they can certainly go off that list and you can talk to farmers and find out what their personal practices are even if they're not organic\nUm you can grow your own food and then also you can wash your produce in a way that helps to reduce those residues using say one part vinegar to three parts clean warm water 'em and agitating that produce you can\nReally take a decent amount of um which is off and if you look at the water you can see that [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWe're exploring an age old seemed too few of us are paying enough attention to the importance of a healthy diet\nPainting or general wellbeing and you're

appeal among many Americans process fast food generates about two hundred billion dollars a year\nHave to eat when you need to eat and so once you've gained a lot of weight healthy food is just not appealing and out of satisfying like less it's less satisfying it's less appealing\nYou will gravitate towards the unhealthy high calorie refined choices that maintained that would be state becomes a very negative cycle\nProfessor Robert ... directs the energy metabolism laboratory at tops the study or eating behaviors to help people manage their weight in sustainable ways\nI think that because America has been a piece for so long it can't just point fingers and say it's the marketing it's the food industry we used our culture has kind of in by the BBC Jenike environment is part of our culture I think people today\nOr did you see obesity Jenike yet I think I've ever heard that word and you fat\nShaming nutrition um\nBut ... you know people have a growing up in families where the parents are obese the kids being fed\nIt be you know promoting food will lead childhood they look on the streets as being normal as opposed to occasional treat the ear it have twice a year at Thanksgiving and you know July Fourth or something like that\nSo it's not just the environment as toxic today the cubs [noise]\nWe put a quarter founder together the way you like it takes me out the juicy hamburger you can really security that way for the fans they were looking one just please\nIn fact there are dangers in consuming too much for the federal dietary guidelines which are updated every five years now recommend that particularly men and boys about half the population should reduce their protein intake\nBut American meat eating is on the rights\nAverage consumers are on track to eat\nMore than two hundred pounds of red meat and poultry per year\nI think people in this culture eat too many animal products ah I don't tell people to become complete vegetarians but I think it'd be very useful for most people to reduce their consumption of animal foods is very solid research showing that ah the more red meat that people eat the increase in all cause mortality\nI'm an beef is a particular problem that we eat too much too much of a by thing would be very useful for people to substitute vegetables protein for some of the animal protein ... such as come in beans beans which are wonderful foods they're cheap there ah you know full of\nFiber vitamins they're a good source of protein\nAnd slow to Justin carbohydrate which doesn't affect blood sugar the way that products made with flour do\nBut health recommendations like that must compete with the power of the marketplace where the primary aim is profit not promoting or will be with domestic meat consumption\nHundred billion pounds per year livestock production is a huge business\nIt would really help if the government subsidized fruits and vegetables and lower the cost of them\nYou know you go into a if you're on a a an Indian reservation in this country and going to grocery stores and sue or is there it's awful what's available to produce if there's there's hardly anything there and what's there as will didn't awful looking\nAt the same thing in poor neighborhoods in this country are you know the fact is that that many people can't afford fruits and vegetables and the government could easily you can't have a government telling us eat more fruits and vegetables and at the same time you know working to make the cheap commodity foods\nAvailable you know we we we have made the unhealthy foods cheapest and most available people eat what is cheap unwanted male and vegetables and fruits are simply out of the price range of many people\nAt the same time America has long had a strong fascination with high end cuisine\nAnd this one is it has an duck had today and if you make one of these concoction Z in the dish which is called the caffeine and fish it's already being\nAn issue unless it like this one is usually call them but they're somewhat interchangeable sales of cookbooks\nOr to an all time high and audiences for cooking shows on television are off the charts and fewer people are working the number\nSo people must be using these cookbooks as coffee table or bathroom reading and uh the TV shows or entertainment doesn't translate into what's being done at home the statistics that I've seen on how few\nAmerican families sit down to even one home cooked meal in a week are pretty dismal\nWhy do you think that's happening [noise]\nWell I I you you people say they don't have time to cook that's a major one or it's too much trouble or they don't know how to do it that it's beyond them and I think in some ways the cooking shows reinforced that that it makes it looks as if this is the realm of professional chefs who have all this knowledge\nAnd to be very exotic yeah has to be very exotic I'm One of our initiatives that are center is to figure out how to get\nMore people back into the kitchen cooking\nAnd to show people you know it is possible to learn how to make quick simple easy\nInexpensive dishes that are healthy and you can make these in quantity that will last for a week you don't have to master a whole huge number of them if you can get like four or five recipes down that you like and then share them with other people on the other

Mediterranean diet healing and doable approach to cutting or risk of heart\nStudy shows that people who follow this way of eating tend to live longer the Mediterranean diet emphasizes primarily vegetables and fruits along with being dishes and nuts and healthy fats like olive oil\nBut the debate continues on how many servings of veggies and fruits people should consume Dr Victoria ... says\nI actually think that ten day is what most of us would encourage you to be helpful and one of the things that I remind\nUs or a list just to clarify ten servings a day to both and fit right in\nForgot that sounds like an insane amount ... remember what a serving sizes which we often also have a ... big apple big granny apple might be two servings of fruit\nA and a large salad like you might get with lunch could be five servings if it's a big salad or three or four if it's a smaller salad and so\nUm you know I I Know a lot of health conscious people wear a salad with some protein is one of their meals either lunch or dinner and that's a way of getting a lot of vegetables and fruits you probably have to have some at every meal to make this work so I personally like to have with my breakfast I Know people eat vegetables with their breakfast\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe're exploring the health effects of the foods we choose to eat ... or intake of vegetables and fruits can cut our risk

health part to please visit human media dot org\n[laughter]\n\nOne of the things is that people are kind of a a strange to from nature and they're not really appreciating the whole cycle in which food arrives at our table\nAnd that can be greatly changed by giving people direct experience in growing their own fruits and vegetables in the backyard or on the window sill or wherever convenient [noise]\nCan you talk about uh some of the benefits of that\nI'm a very passionate gardener I grow a lot of my own food I take great pleasure in that Dr Andrew Weil I was laughing 'cause I remember\nOne time I had a group of medical students come to my home and uh I took them out to my garden and I had some beautiful broccoli that was almost ready to pick\nAnd I remember this one students eyes bugged out that he had no conception that broccoli grew on a plan I don't know what he thought but I think he thought maybe it was only pulled up like a beep from the ground or it hung from a tree he just had never imagined that here was this thing that he's used to seeing in a store that was growing on a plant\nA ... I Need you to come to my raised bed in Massachusetts because I have not been successful\nBroccoli oh I I I grew massive rocker weeks in my backyard garden in Tucson ... it's an easy one to do I would be happy to consult with you on that or you call a and I were\nCultural extension service uh uh one of the universities and they'll tell you how to do it\nClearly my broccoli technique needs some improvement but when I'm able to get to the guard knife had success with other vegetables and fruits and it's kind of fun to be out there cultivating the planes and even more fun to be plucking that fresh produce for dinner\nYou can grow a really remarkable amounts of food and relatively small space or even a small backyard space even in window boxes I'm very satisfying to do that the taste of freshly\nHarvested vegetables is amazing a ... you know often uh\nI I Love to cook and I love to cook for people and I don't like complicated preparations like fairly simple things in both flavors and many people do eat my food or knocked out by the flavor and it's not anything I did it that this was fresh they'd probably never really had\nFresh broccoli or fresh letters from regarding the taste of [noise]\nI recently made my way to a gathering of community gardeners the inner city ... section of Boston where I met sewer retired architect Nancy a bookkeeper in the food industry\nWhy are you interested in growing food and in particular doing so in a community garden\nPlug growing food because it just tastes so much better than when you get in a grocery because a threat because it's fresh and it's not a lot of things you get in a grocery are hybrids developed to pack well and stay stay well for a long time like your tomatoes there knows that never get right yeah yeah\nThat from fertilizer that's been added to the corn and soybeans to feed the animals and then nitrate inner finished drinking water increases your risk of cancer especially certain kinds of bladder cancer\nWe know that we have a problem in this country was clean drinking water\nPhysician Eliot Cohen from Princeton New Jersey\nCertainly in third world countries in other areas where they can't get free clean 'em you know water not only from bacteria that from other um you know heavy metal on you know in ... chemicals that get into waterways um and even in the United states is not just lead in Flint, Michigan which we you know I haven't winds up in arms for good reason that we have led in\nHundreds of other command if not thousands of communities we have chromium sex we have\nUm you know just a lotta PF LA's and and problems with nonstop chemicals getting into the waterway even in ...

sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um digs are nests and\nLay their eggs safely and there are only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest one uh that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island you can see a small little bit of fans still sticking up above\nThe waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it price for the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left\nWill they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north to some of the other ... there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many\nTest that can be used at home by prescription only information that color guard test dot com\nFrom NPR and W. B. U. R. I'm Peter O'Dowd Mrs here and now there's new evidence of a strong economy today with the Commerce Department reporting growth of three and a half percent between July and September the economy is on track to have your best years since two thousand and five\nBut one sector not doing so well housing especially in the northeast where it's estimated home sales are down by\nFifty percent from last year and some economists are saying Trump's tax cuts\nAre to blame Mike ... is senior news editor at Bloomberg Mike it's good to have you always good to be here if you know so this fifty percent drop in sales in the northeast is the midpoint of a broader estimate but either way it is large and its southern so what's what's going on [noise] well\nIt before we even talk about the implications of the tax cuts that it's important to realize the background here uh about the housing industry nationally there has been this concern coming into this year even that home prices had just gotten too high for a many members especially of the the big demographic of millennials to afford\nAnd then you tack on to that this aggressive rise in interest rates that we've seen a and that makes obviously makes buying homes even more expensive\nBut finally it's clear that many believe this tax cut is also having an effect here or many critics of this year's tax cut had warned in advance that there could be this sort of impact\nOn housing on the coasts especially because the tax plan kept the state and local tax deductions that you can claim on your federal income taxes\nSo if you get less of a tax refund for your local real estate taxes\nI'm a new homes tend to have the highest real estate taxes of any homes um it actually makes buying a new home even more expensive um and that means people that are upgrading for motor homes are a sort of priced out too so it has a very much a ripple effect\nLet's take a look at some of those numbers a thirty year mortgage on a four hundred thousand dollar house in Providence Rhode Island now Twenty one thousand dollars more expensive and that's not even a very expensive city in relative terms or in Boston eighty four thousand dollars higher that makes a big difference\nIt does it does and like you said at the beginning of the economy is strong unemployment is historically low the demand for houses should be there um it's just that all these issues make a homes more expensive\nAnd the builders of new homes are for obvious reasons going to be reluctant to cut prices to aggressively\n[noise] we did see these solid GDP numbers today unemployment is still very low what is it what I mean what does it housing new say about the broader economy should we be concerned that things are starting to tip the wrong direction\nIt's definitely something to keep an eye on a one thing I've been looking at very closely is\nThe share prices of publicly traded a home builders there's an index of home builders stocks that's absolutely crashed this year it's down forty percent off so that signals to me that people believe these these builders are going to have to lower prices pretty aggressively really are killing their profit margins\nAnd home building and housing is such an important um element of the economy I don't need to remind anyone of its role in the financial crisis I'm so this is certainly a something that all of Wall Street I I can guarantee you keeping a very close eye on\nThe average rate on a thirty year fixed mortgage is about a percentage point higher today than it was a year ago that's going to make A People's monthly payments quite a bit more expensive as well so we think we're watching as far as my Greek and senior editor senior editor at Bloomberg News Mexican you're listening to hear
