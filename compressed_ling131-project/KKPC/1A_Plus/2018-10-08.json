I don't know I\nKnow it it does it does make sense I'm interested in how and how you answer this question William about as the president says as being a very scary time for young men and I'll just interject the the count as a at least twenty two women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct dating back to the seventies but go ahead or William\nYeah I think there are thought and reaction that men should be afraid it's\nBest to a certain point but I can also understand tell a certain men could be scared and those certain men probably should be scared because they're also probably perpetrators\nDid yeah we we know statistically as you said that the false reports of sexual or like so so low and jumping and other people are just kind of made it seem that hundreds of thousands of men are being falsely accused like every second of every day\n[noise] I Wonder if you are as we wrap up here you might give us two or three action items men can take to make the culture for ...\nThe voters if you'd be served by each Colorado State senator and representative\nWilson beginning of the commission on the very first day that we met I read a letter into the record and I asked the other ten commissioners let's do it differently this time\nWe were said let's not decide on maps with a simple majority we should all be able to agree here\nAt the end of the day my my plea and my hope was do we pass I'm happy to get both Republican votes in democratic votes and it would be a consensus outcome that approach was not accepted by either party I was asked when was the reaction when you read that letter and I think that the probably the most descriptive word is crickets [noise]\nAt that point it becomes a partisan process so I Do fall to being a Republican member of the commission\nWhat does that mean like what were you advocating for when it came to you know fighting for Republican interest on this mission\nI mean the partisans on the on the commission their job is is I mean just to put it bluntly used to draw mouth it's going to let the most members of their party possible and that's really what this comes down to it is purely a play for power and whichever party has the most votes is going to draw the most favorable map [noise]\n\n... where he says that's what happened Democrats admitted maps at the last minute after what he thought was the final deadline\nThis is after months of process big scandal Denver Post reported on it didn't matter the next day we had to vote\nAnd the single independent on the panel voted with the Democrats to approve the map right away it was seen as a Republican live the new boundaries knocked out from the European come in and it created more competitive seats where Democrats had a shot of winning\nIt kind of comes down to a question of priorities if you're a voter is your priority that you live in a community where you've got a congressperson who's really focused on your concern because everybody in this district share something\nOr do you want to live in a district where maybe there are a lot of very different kinds of communities in it but your Congress person has to fight for their job every couple of years and maybe somebody else knew I was going to come take it if they can represent your district better\n[noise] you're listening to purplish from CPR news when we come back Sam will look at amendments y and Z and how they're supposed to balance the tug of war between community and competitiveness he'll also try to cheat the proposed system\nTo see if it can stop political operatives want to drive the lines\nIn their sides favor for Colorado matters from CPR news\nSupport for Colorado Public radio comes from lock me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more at go to meetings dot com\nSupport comes from the University of Denver celebrating homecoming and family weekend with hockey food music and more October the eleventh through the fourteenth registration information at B.

I'm I'm a resident of Grand Junction Colorado\nAnd the Democrat served with Robert Mueller and the\nState house we're just getting together because we wanted to catch up on\nWhat each of us was doing she doesn't remember what you eat\nI probably probably had a salad I've probably been undercut that was a site order fries\n[laughter] I'm pretty sure I had the salmon Caesar [laughter]\nUm and we got we got to discussing a politics where I was doing ... policy and we'd redistricting came up I think there was just a a unanimous feeling around the table why can't this get fixed everybody sees what's wrong with it it's just patently obvious that this is a broken system\nHow come it hasn't been fixed until now ... and you\nKnow we're all legislators we used to serve in the legislature so it's very easy to say you know it isn't as good as when we were there [laughter] and and how do we make it better but we ... we kind of agreed on five six seven principles that would be involved in doing this right\nIt was these principles that formed the backbone of what's now y and Z and they have to overarching goals and prevent partisan gerrymandering and striking a balance between keeping communities together and encouraging competition so first idea to do that\nThe missions or to have\nEqual representations from an affiliate\nIn other words the panel should have the same number of Democrats or Republicans and unaffiliated voters\nBut we also believe that the decision making should be done by a super majority\nSo that you just don't have one person who's vote swings the outcome\nThe idea was to require a bipartisan compromise and they decided that compromise should be struck in public not some back board room with a bunch of well paid politicos\nThis entire process should be subject to open meetings and open records and as transparent as possible there should be neutral criteria that don't favor either party\nThis means the districts should have to conform to city and county lines wherever possible and they should be compact not weird so quickly shapes that don't make any sense and if the commissioners managed to meet\nThose goals these commissions should promote the maximum number of competitive district\nThe first respect communities and then whenever possible draw competitive districts\nThis group of former lawmakers walked out with a plan it was by no means an easy route onto the ballot\nThe state Supreme Court shut down at first attempt in twenty sixteen and this year they had to merge it with competing redistricting proposal from a coalition of progressive groups finally last may the state legislature referred y and Z to the ballot\nIn Colorado at its best and I think we've got in front of us said Colorado solution that will soon be a model across the country\nAnd they did it in a pretty surprising way they voted unanimously to get out of the redistricting\nAmendment [noise] who really wants to stand in front of their constituents who say I support the status quo where uh the partisans draw maps and where you voter are completely taken out of the equation\n[noise] and you mentioned earlier that you have no doubt that if this passes there will be political operatives were plotting to find some you know little way to get an edge do you see any vulnerabilities in the plant\n'em well if I did I'm not going to advertise to invite the operative to game the system but ah there's the old saying that if you build a better mouse trap them ice gets [noise]\nOkay so ... where it might not be willing to speculate about how somebody could steal the cheese from his proposed newer fancier mouse trap but I can [noise]\nTell me do it we're going to turn now to a mandated Gonzales she's the executive director of Colorado common cause the nonpartisan group that supports butter access and trying to make government as representative as possible and it helped craft amendments y and Z\nSo for our conversation I'm going to be the sneaky political operative and look for ways to to gain a person that sounds good sounds guy he looked like every political operative nine out really well I'll just tell you when I play monopoly like I'm ruthless hide money under the board\nI read the bank I on mortgage properties I make trades based on future incomes I'll take kickbacks like\nYou're not a political library but in another life maybe\nSo my big fat for how to cheat your is your system is to get the right people on the commission people who are my people who I can trust us or my interest in my party so walk me through it how how does this work okay so we're trying to ...\nAt two four four and four four\nDemocrats four Republicans four and a ... percent correct twelve twelve people in our commission the first that is there's an application and now it's to all of Colorado anybody can apply\nTo even you could fill your dream of being on a redistricting commission there are some requirements you can't be a lobbyist or an elected official or have worked for a political party then you got a survivor random lottery\nBecause in California and they had\nOver thirty thousand applicants so we're just trying to ensure in case something like that how we get that much interest in Colorado that they're sort of manageable poor\nThis was going to be like you know signing up to go to Hamilton or something right high stakes after that a panel it's three retired judges then evaluate those pools for what's called initiated community criteria\nAre you part of your neighborhood association your PTA whenever we want people who\nLive in a hot a whole don't know anything about the state right next six of the commissioners would be a pointed at random the other six would be appointed by that same group of retired judges with some advice from legislative leaders and they're going to do that with a lens for the diversity in the states so that the commission hopefully\nLooks pretty similar to the state of color [noise]\nOkay I I mean as the political operative here I mean\nIs this complicated just to like confused me is that the purpose of why am\nI going to say that we're trying to confuse you but we're definitely trying\nTo work because they have to get through a couple of different stages of both random chance and nonpartisan selection it should be pretty difficult to hand picked someone\n... this commission its its records would be open to the public right correct hearings would be open to the public they would and they have to be held throughout the state okay\nSeller owns this organic free range of operation and hot

dad's ashes are up underneath the big top one tree\nRaymond move back to the farm in the eighties to set up her vet clinic and breed horses after her father passed away when the chickens came in Thirty years later Raymond says the feathers Dustin stink made her life miserable that it was also miserable to either one fighting against the farm\nAnd became\nPolitical nightmare a smear campaign false narrative about\nThe right to farm and I kept saying what about my right to farm and I think it should be renamed rights to harm it's been used as a sword and not a shield whereas my protection\nShe did try to take Hostettler back to court and lost again Raymond says her only choice now is to sell her land she says clients stopped using her vet services that people confronted her in public\nAnd she says it's because her case it's framed as a threat to people's right to farm rallies and fundraisers for hostile or advertised the local papers and flyers were put up around town

how to protect yourself nice county fairgrounds\nAnd our thoughts a farmer ... would do it again he's president of the farm bureau currently running for state Senate and he was one of the county commissioners that first approved tossed that lawyers have operation\nFarming creates a farming create smell\nAnd if every farmer has to be sure that there is no does there is no smell it'll put them out of business so then there will be no for me so then where where are we as a society\nNeeds worries aren't just in Colorado rusty around me is that the national agricultural law center\nJust been a a really big deal here in the last year or two but this is probably easily one of the top and questions we get from across the country\nHe says each state has some version of a right to farm lobby put into place in the seventies and eighties when urban sprawl started to bump into farmland when he says the law doesn't do as much to protect farmers as people might think it does\nFeel violating environmental laws or anything like that does nothing\nThat's not how people on the losing side of these conflicts feel especially against massive corporate operations more common in the south\nThat recently courts ruled in favor of neighbors who sued the corporation not the farmer\nA jury found Smithfield Foods the largest pork producer in the world are their neighbors more than four hundred and fifty million dollars in damages for failing to stop smells and other nuisances and these cases have some states scrambling to try and strengthen their right to farm laws\nAnd you gotta do something to protect your ...\nMontrose barber Weber shows me and said he Mickey her home she moved to a town when her son took over the ranch to this subdivision that was actually once ranch plant across the

to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks\nTo go what did you see there I mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not saying natural catastrophe it's a man made a trauma that as a result of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I wouldn't either side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about yeah\nI mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east of them the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who seek to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support also UK all the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to topple the Yemeni control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines uh Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the ... data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through I'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who the is on the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who sees [noise]\nBut I don't either and the other side from the Saudis the lesson UK\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll tell you drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nOr the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death\nBut at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of all ... and I says\nInvestigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listened on apple pod cast\nHere and now from NPR and W. B. U. R. I. Lisa Mullins the people's bank of China announced yesterday that it will reduce the amount of reserves commercial banks are required to hold by one percentage point\nThe move freeze up banks to lend up to one hundred Seventy five billion dollars to Chinese borrowers there's a scene is China's latest attempt to spur growth in the face of blading tariffs from the Trump Administration\nSome analysts have characterized those tariffs as impulsive but there are now some people who think they may be a part of a grand us strategy toward China\nAre going to talk about that now with jewels lessons or she's business analyst with CBS News and who's to Jill on money her podcast is better off\nHello Jill hello so first to telling stats of stocks in Shanghai of fallen Fifteen Percent since the beginning of this year and China's currency as we can nine percent against the u._s. dollar so there are signs that the Chinese economy is indeed vulnerable uh the Chinese Communist party\nDerives its legitimacy from continuing economic growth so how much is that growth and the legitimacy in jeopardy now\nWell look the Chinese economy which is eight twelve trillion dollar economy the second largest in the world\nIs still going to grow this year probably by around let's call it six and a half percent or so but a lot of problems at the country has faced predate the Trump administration's tariffs we know that\nThe manufacturing sector has certainly been hit recently\nBut you know we've seen the pace of expansion of investment in houses and factories and railroads\nA key driver of Chinese has actually fall in and and that was happening before the terrorists at what we're seeing in this action by the government is an attempt to spur economic growth but also to make sure that everyone knows they still have a little gunpowder left\nAnd that the Chinese economy is not going to ... butter out of control without the government being involved it\nSeems as though the Trump administration's goal is to weaken China as much as they can but I Wonder how different things are from the Obama era the current White House he uses a lot more bellicose language uh whereas back then Brock Obama called U.S China strategy appeal but at the core though isn't the goal continuing to try to stop China's rise\nI I don't know if it's to stop the rise I Do think that both administrations share one core belief and that is\nThat you know they want China to actually continue modernizing its economy but they are not so clear that they like these business in trade practices which essentially\nSay to the United states and the company's based in the United states come on cell you're good cheer you can operate but you're going to have to cough up your technology or go into a joint venture with the Chinese company\nSo I don't think that we're trying to stop China I think we're trying to make the Chinese trade practices fairer and I think that has been consistent over the last dozen or so years and how effective is it\nWell you know right now we don't know and and I think that these trade tariffs have become really problematic\nOn in in essence because they start sparking other conversations we we hear Chinese officials saying hey you know you want to be really tough you want to start putting more terrorist another two hundred fifty seven billion dollars of good will don't forget we're the key to North Korea\nSo this isn't just a trade issue it's a power issue and it does appear that the Trump Administration is trying to throw a wage and they're getting allies on one side all lined up with new trade policies and enforcing the allies to kind of come with the U.S and freeze out China\nAnd try to really agitate for more reform we don't know whether it's going to be successful or not but it does seem to be a bit more strategic than initially thought\nJoe's lessons or business analyst for CBS News and host of Jill on money always nice to have you on the program thank you thank you you're listening to hearing now [noise]\nSee\nElection day is around the corner and Colorado Public radio is here to bring you a broad picture of how this election will affect the state to get a better understanding of what other Coloradans are thinking about visit CPR dot org for our road trip to November a collection of conversations and photographs taken you from the mountains to the planes\nCities and small towns the western slope to the front range and follow the map of our road trip to November and CPR dot org\nI'm Sharon ...
