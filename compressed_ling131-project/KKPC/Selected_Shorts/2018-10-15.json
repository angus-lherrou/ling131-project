well apply to our next story to listen to this found a celebration [noise]\nFrom what is the key points in a new film for that but you're just being screened says London film festival\nThis code a cashier and while it's set in the house or the Sudanese civil war he is actually a love story and a comedy the director has huge cook I came to the studio to tell us about it\nAt ... is this um comedy I'll be humorous comedy that was totally shot in a war zone\nAnd so he tells us about this soldier who in the off season and it's really weird to say there's an off season to war but in the Sudanese civil war\nIn the rainy season the tanks and cars can move because of the mud and ... and the fighting stops and in that period our main character is this guy who is off for a couple of months in the off season\nAnd I'm at the catch is happening because she has a round up to a basic need the army the rebel army wants to round up everybody 'cause it's dry again and in twenty four hours they have to run capture all the soldiers who are like running around and our main actor is this guy who\nIs running around being a use he falls in love and yet he's with his government any causes some issues and now he has to solve all his problems within twenty four hours they can go back to the\nReading some of the reviews the funniest film you'd have to say about a Sudanese civil war the Sudanese slacker movie as you're pushing these films in the show with a different direction to another of Sudanese films\nA big part of me and making this film was the Sudanese image like what is it to be the attorneys and\nThere's this box that people want to put us in and it's because of who we are and they slamming government and all that and I want it to bake it and I wanted to create something that's more Sudanese like a Sudanese person would experience in the street or whatever and this to me\nWas created by I I used to have this small little book and every incident that happened that was funny in front of me I Would write it down and and that created a story that's very nice very things that people will be like this is what we normally do\nIt quite a difficult thing is meant to make a comedy about a war zone I mean that's a difficult ground to walk them\nSo I shot it in in ... so he was in a civil war there were so basically in two thousand sixteen in July the Sudanese government was bombing so I was like running around documenting the bombing and being bombed dad and all that andme actors are all being bombed that and then in July ends\nIn less than ... when the um the couches the soldiers are lying down on the ground in the you know there's a plate overhead there's a boom lots that's real life\nThat's real life that documentary and the plane flying that's actually the real Sudanese ... fighter jets bombed to add to that that Israel and but then the rest of the films fictional\nSo in that reality in that war zone you are making a documentary about before you might just this feature film where are you laughing alone I mean was that comedy in your everyday war zone or just in the film\nSo what happened was when I made the documentary and then we ... we started having this ... a cinema thing so we go around in the different villages and will show the film\nAll these different films and the whole village comes out like four hundred people a thousand five hundred people and they would be like celebrating 'cause they're coming out and they wonder why cinema and they start laughing at the smallest little thing and some of his like\nThis is a serious film and yes there's that little part but people are really excited\nSo from that excitement we decided that what people really want to see is something exciting and comedy and laugh and get them to get together and be happy so that's why we started creating for a short films and then this film came about\nShe talked about wanting to change the image of sue them what do you want to show\nSo I Want to show and I was trying to do I mean I don't think in any country in the world there's this one image of being there's no one image of being British there's no one image of being Italian there's and there's diversity of being human in Sudan and goes to an extreme because we have a hundred and fifty different languages we have all these different\nGroups ethnic groups we had all these histories that connected us do this one spot that became a country [noise]\nSo for us to just have one image which is obviously going to be the urban how to image because urban folks are a loud voice than they have access to I Want it to create an image that of people who are living life and they're happy in their normal lives\nEven if that no more life as it was on\nEven if the normal life gets interrupted by war all the time\nOh yay crucial difference a normal life getting interrupted by war and in this case interrupted was actually a very very funny a film I Swear to send them off for the people who lost a long list moments when the main characters to dress up as women women to get out of a difficult situation as a soldier who's in love with his gun there's\nA number of say the rules

that\nWe're going to continue to prescribe the drugs you'd been there is a problem what's going on with that it doesn't make sense to me\nWell so we have seen an increase in the rate of of opioid
