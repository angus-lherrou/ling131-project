Associated Press national politics reporter Lisa thanks for coming on welcome to America on the line\nHide Ryan thanks for having me\nSo this just broke a couple of hours ago and it was from an AP interview right how the president is comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat dry our White House reporters did sit down with the president just a little while ago and we have a number of stories coming out this evening from that interview one of them is is posted online now in circulating\nAnd he said you know the president has really been I'm leaning into this idea of giving Saudi Arabia some distance from there is a case that they've seen journalist and he told the reporters there and the interview\nThat he said quote you know I think we have to find out what happened first and here we go again with you now you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that he said we just went through that with justice cabin on he was and this and all the way\nSo he's really can carrying Saudi Arabia\nAnd whether or not the um [noise] a crime presidents and the government there Saudi Arabia was that all involved in the disappearance ... the yeah that's a review and journalists to have gone into the consulate there and just involved\nAnd never return dad and he um the president is is really sort of I'm questioning whether or not the government with even end often we of course you know multiple reports\nUh now you know indicating that they're there may have been involved in there and it is something that is of course a massive investigation right now in Turkey has say uncover what happened two weeks ago\nTrump is a very sort of instinctive intuitive a politician and I think he I I wouldn't call it quite a strategy here I think he does have some sense of what has worked for him on the campaign trail and what he thinks has worked for him as president\nAnd so he kind of follows his got and he knows that lashing out saying what comes into his mind or even if other presidents would have to walk it back\nIn and have it be labeled a gaffe he knows he can kind of bluster and fight his way through those kinds of statements because of the persona he's established\nFor himself people often say that we're living in an unprecedented time but historians like yourself usually push back on that\nAnd say no this has happened before I Know you wrote that a Teddy Roosevelt invented spin do do you think it's completely unprecedented the way Trump is using spin and out and outlaws and whatever else you want to label it to achieve his goals\nWell during are the two thousand sixteen campaign I got a lot of calls from reporters saying is this unprecedented and I did push back I Would point to figures like George Wallace\nOr Joe McCarthy who would engage in the kind of demagoguery that that was working for Trump\nNow that he's president now he's been access for almost two years I think we do have to acknowledge there's something unprecedented here uh I thought of\nWith my book Republic of spin which came out in two thousand sixteen adding a chapter beyond spin to to deal with Trump because I Do think\nAh the dynamics that we had gotten used to through the Clinton Bush Obama years yeah now do feel a little dated we are on into some very different terrain\nAnd I know you've drawn a distinction between the Kavanaugh hearings where each side had their own truth versus yesterday when Elizabeth Warren asked Trump to pay up the million dollars that he said he would pay her if she took a DNA test and it did show some Native American blood\nAnd he just said I never said that what why do you make a distinction between the Elizabeth Warren and be a cabinet situations\nRight so I think in our politics today we have plenty of good old fashioned spin if I can call it that the competing sense sets of part isn't talking points\nThe different frames four interpreting the political situation\nUh and that's what we saw Kavanaugh the Republicans were essentially interpreting the charges one way Democrats for for the most part interpreting another way and individuals kind of had these two ah you know interpretations to choose from\nWhat Trump is doing really does recall you know the propaganda of\nThe communist or the fascists without saying that he deserves those labels himself but it's more of a brazen attempt you out of George Orwell\nTo say that what you saw with your own eyes what you heard with your own ears is false and that that's different from saying I Do believe her I don't believe him\nThat's what we call gas lighting isn't it [noise]\nWell I think gas lighting is a term that's kind of getting use now in this broader sense that sort of a region aided well first with the angel as ray film and so on but kind of with relationships in psychology so yeah you could apply here ice I said he I think\nPeople think that they are going crazy right as opposed to believing the truth is or the facts or the observations that they see with their own eyes 'cause somebody's planting doubt to make them doubt their own perceptions\nRight what I'm not so sure about is that Trump is really making anyone think they're crazy those of us\nWho heard the tape of him you know daring Elizabeth Warren to take a DNA test know full well that he simply lying or ... retailing salsa it's\nSo I don't think he's really confusing anyone he is just counting on his loyal supporters in the media and in the public to take his side so it's a little bit different but it's in the same family of breaking down the traditional categories of truth and fall so\nIt's in the category of nothing matters as they might say on Saturday Night live\nA little bit I mean this is the other phrase we heard in recent years a is post truth\nA sense not that there isn't truth but that it doesn't matter that wants to political loyalties are other tribal loyalties and attachments override the empirical questions of\nWho said what the significance of X or y and it's fair that I think Trump has taken us into some some uncharted waters\nCan you give us a little thirty second history lesson on how Teddy Roosevelt invented spin\nRight well I I well it's a little strong and say he invented it I'd say he\nReally began the process of building the machinery of spin as it's attached to the American presidency so before the twentieth century presence really weren't out there all that much making public statements trying to mobilize the public\nAnd it was Teddy Roosevelt who in holding press conferences staging publicity stunts hiring PR officials in different agencies\nReally recognize that swaying public opinion through what's now this vast apparatus was part of the president's job\nDavid Greenberg political columnist and author of the book Republican spin by the way my crack sat checkers say on the really important stuff that it wasn't angel and it's very it was Ingrid Bergman in the movie so just putting that out there um and when we come back\nWe will kind of go down that gas lighting well do you feel you've been gas let the ... and your mental health David Greenberg thanks a lot\n[noise]

about the mid term elections we'll talk now about how the steady stream of rough and tumble news about politics and the increasing\nTenuous relationship of things that are said to be fat and truth\nIs affecting many of us in somewhat less than clinical terms the news is making us crazy so we brought in an expert Dr Cindy bound Baker a clinical psychologist who is joining us from Philadelphia\nAnd her take us neither political nor a predictable she's got so many scenarios of individuals from left right and other working through their feelings about the country today in various ways couples to so welcome Dr bound Baker\nThank you very much glad to be here\nAnd listeners will take your calls at eight four four seven\nFour or five talk is the news or the political environment being recorded on by news outlets stressing you out how are you dealing with it are you cutting back on news are you watching more news I think we'll hear a story of that as a way to cope\nFrom our guest healthier dealing with it how can your experiences help your fellow listeners to cope or what questions might you have for a doctor bound Baker aid for for seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five eight four or five eight four four I'll do that one more time aid for for\nSeven four or five talk um you have so many interesting scenarios let's run a few before run through a few before we take some calls from listeners\nI'm One of the stories you told us off the air is one member of spousal unit is anxious\nShe's wanting to watch the news all the time the husband just turned off by that because watching the news is making him anxious can you talk about that couple in what they represent\nYou know your superior to me and we're not going to let you do it fall thank you so much for calling in\nAs we continue a with Philadelphia clinical psychologist Dr Cindy down based on how the news is making me crazy can you expand a little bit on that Republicans scenario um that I mentioned before but I think we didn't really get to it\nAnd you heard from Paul about his relatives but this this reaction to the rage that liberals are Democrats have somehow not just being different but being an attempt to silence them\n[noise] yeah well I think it's very tough I'm going to shift a little bit and and feel for the people who are Republicans right now who have lost friends those you know they really believe 'em what they believe\nAnd um the rage that I think there's reach really on both sides and whenever we were feeling rage we stop listening you know it's sort of this I'm nip it in position of of rage\nBecause for a lot of Democrats and progressives it's not just this tax rate versus ... or something like that it's if you think this you're ... you're on the margin is things on\nYeah it well it it's shaming it's labeling I I I think of I'm a physician or that I Know\nWho um is a Russian descent and she and her entire family who voted for the president and believe very strongly and the president\nUm and believed that Democrats are really naive as all get out and in that case um you know there's a sense of you guys are nuts that the Democrats are going to get us you know the belief was the Democrats were going to get us into World War three um and I believe that this\nKind of authoritarian rule um is what works so it becomes a cultural thing and this was a very good in being she's the caring physician\nA bug very much a Trump supporter let's take another call here is Marcy and nags head North Carolina Hi Marcy\nHi thanks for having me on and tell us your story um I\nCompletely relate to what the last caller said about his family I'm\nKind of on a different level I live in an area that I'm by liberal ideas are considered the minority um\nThe way that I voted I consider the minority and that's very difficult um my dad created a monster and me as far as the political junkie and he passed away seven years ago he was a moderate Republican who and his older years\nI'm kind of adopted a lot more liberal views\nAnd we had great conversations he would listen to me rant and rave um he would give me\nHis opinion he would agree with me on something so he was kind of like my Republican sounding board to let me know that said I wasn't crazy about some of these things and now that I'm missing that I feel like I have\nNo one really around my husband agrees with me on we both the same way but he is an end to it as much as I Am I so I feel very isolated I kind of\nTake things in I watch the news I get angry and I don't have an outlet and tea has accused me of being angry especially during the Kavanaugh hearings and it wasn't even just because of the me too it was more because\nYou know he blatantly lied and they still confirmed that it was just outrageous the whole charade and I felt like I had no one\nTo discuss it with a little bit with my husband but\nI was angry I was angered at my phone call semi senators and all that and you know and\nCalling constantly getting nothing and that's kind of what I feel I'm so waiting for November six because that kind of on holding out hope for that so\nDown the little ... to ...\nHave a I have a number of things to say here of Morsi and and you know obviously many of us are similarly to you [noise]\nUm I was made things a little bit different now to them when you and your dad used to have like a tennis game of politics\nIs that we there was a void in how we identify ourselves these days you know they used to be people identified by where they lived in what religion they were they were a variety of things and now we're in a very mobile society people aren't all that involved in organized religion\nSo that void of how we identify ourselves has been taken over by our political identifications\nAnd I think one something has to do as an identification it's very vulnerable to shame and so we're shaming each other and that feels really quite awful [noise]\nI I I get concerned about the blue wave in November I I Do um you know I think there might be one um but if not I get concerned\nFor the people who are pinning their hopes on it um because it is a perfect example of this and I I Hope that address is it a little bit\nUm I I went to get lunch today I was in the elevator and I wear this button that says mom demand action from gun control\nAnd this stranger in the elevator said to me you know the trouble with today is that we're in so much trouble and there's nothing we can do and that's exactly what you just said to me I feel this sense of learned helplessness like what can I Do and boy oh boy November better come around and and I feel like\nI can at least have a voice again I'm a social media and maybe plays a part for you in that you can find communities I'm that way it's not you know in ... real time felt sent an interesting how immunity of people how social\nMedia can be both isolating and community forming we have to take a

Senate race in Texas between Republican incumbent Ted Cruz and democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke they had a debate last night and our work took some harsher than usual swings cruise\nMissiles which you can expect over the course of this debate center cruise not going to be honest with you he's going to make up positions and votes but I've never held or I've ever take his dishonest for the president called them wind and that's why the nickname so because of\nWork is behind cruise in the polls but only trailing by single digits in a very red state Ashley Lopez senior reporter at K. U. T. joins us from Austin with more high actually hey and let's listen to one of a last night's fiery or exchanges this is Senator Cruz talking about our works relationship with President Trump\nWith ... leading the way two years of a partisan circus shutting down the federal government in a witch hunt on the president's that's not good for the state of Texas is not good for our country\nIs in her ... her time not asserted response and you Mr ... really interesting to hear you talk about a particle circus after your interest in in the U.S Senate\nAnd their crews said during the debate that it is clear that congressman or works pollsters have told him to come out on the attack what do you make of his more aggressive strategy last night\nWell yeah Oregon's definitely changed his tone a little bit since the beginning of the campaign for most of the campaign or work wasn't even mentioning Ted Cruz in fact you know he didn't come up and rallies almost at all\nBut there have been some Democrats in this day who have been expressing frustration that O'Rourke hasn't been more forceful in highlighting the very real real ways in which he is different from crews and with election day this close O'Rourke is probably finding it is important for those distinctions to be clear what was cruises strategy\nWell he's been using the same strategy all along which is that he's making a case that Texas is just too conservative for Beto O'Rourke who cruises painted as this liberal um\nYou know an extreme liberal that and you know it hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office in more than two decades so it could be that that's a really salient point to make\nAnd through this at a couple of times that have given the chance O'Rourke will take the opportunity to align himself politically an ideologically with what he calls the radical left that here's a good example that\nI Want to repeal Obamacare reduce premiums protects preexisting conditions and expand access congressman O'Rourke wants socialized medicine the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor I\nWant to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going\nYes it could be making the case that Republicans have been delivering protections for a while now and ... wants to undo all that work\nNow or work has raised a lot of money record thirty eight million dollars just now making this the most expensive Senate race in history or he is counting on support from Texas who don't typically turn out to vote Latino voters young people let's listen to a moment from his closing statement last night\nOn issues of immigration reform of the fate of dreamers no which one is out in the state of Texas when the Senate voted to move forward on debate for dreamers ... senators showed up to Ninety seven motives and move forward only one senator voted no proof of his career above the interest on whether or not there's\nNo people that are watching this election say it is going to be difficult for work to get people who don't typically vote to the polls what people think about whether he can pull that off\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he profiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nBen Bradlee junior welcome to hear now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\nThis is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre uh it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went down\nInitially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host and learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person or redo to another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on twelve or who stories\nI decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that at least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple relate double speak like huge big league or big league may have turned off voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county but I think people\nBase most of their vote for president on the extent to which\nThey can relate to them on a human level or how likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and I think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really likes his style they just like to do is uh is moxie his feisty in is how we get up every morning and um it has a tweet storm and I'm six or to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them no on\nThe contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable ...\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in ... county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is it's not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this I said well that's the practice job candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable\n[noise] what about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump it's still predominantly Catholic\nMajority so there's a rising are evangelical population\nTrump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered\nShe does he's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nThat he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there are also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict or um the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I'd read the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a fix that sort of an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness\nAbout it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving this brain brain is not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really a sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump for the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nSo I got an up the budget he filed in February or shows a seven trillion dollar increase so no Republican Party doesn't seem to care\n... what about these voters do they care about those things they don't have in the Bible to\nDo they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like lives there and county well they certainly did and\nThe twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats what other people that I talked to were Democrats a but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms well\nIf I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats to retake the house but I'm not the Senate\nThen barely junior ... one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse into the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\nDid so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coasts test to look down on on them you didn't do that here well thank you\nI appreciate that because we the the big bad media so called a degree that the mainstream media as it's called is so often accused of looking down on\nPeople in the middle of the country or fly over country as it's called disparaging lean and the lesson of the ... campaign uh was obviously the the
