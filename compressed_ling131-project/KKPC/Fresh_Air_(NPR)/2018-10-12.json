WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday we bring you the latest political developments issues and analysis and we hear from you tonight we're focusing on voting who will who won't and who can't\nBecause of new voting rights regulations that make it almost impossible\nWill get into that in a minute but speaking of impossible it may be impossible to imagine a more bizarre scene than what occurred today at the White House when the press corps was brought into the oval office to listen to a ten minute monologue\nFrom Kanye West joining me now from the ... from Washington to talk about the event and more consequential news is Washington Post reporter Eugene Scott\nEugene thank you very much for being on America on the line thanks for having me\nSo I Want to start with I'm Serious news and that is um the latest on our colleague Jamal could show the is there anything new beyond what our paper the Washington Post reported yesterday in terms of um\nThis being a direct action called by the crown prince\nYeah we're looking at a Congress right now a senator some particular both sides are licking a into waves to force a vote that could scrappy us arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr out of frustration about the disappearance of ... and so we could see some changes happening verified naturally a which is where the Saudi Government has you know been used to being hit most and could lead them to be more forthcoming about what happened\nI'm the president was asked about I'm Jamal 'cause she'll get let's hear what he had to say about the global opinions writer\nIn the best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizens is that right or is that a permanent resident okay we don't like it John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable today\nSo it sounds like we're we're hearing that Congress is stepping up in trying to be a check on the executive in this regard\nIs anyone talking about the fact that the leader of the free world is not taking a stand on freedom of the press which the United states\nHas always been a beacon of light um when it comes to that in standing up for democracy\n[noise] you know not especially but we should not be surprised considering a track record our president has had when it comes to a respecting the press um [noise]\nHe has not been one who has consistently advocated for journalists being able to hold their governments accountable or even you know we're dealing with American citizens and as as he saw as you heard in that\nIn Indiana I'm Christina or or or Michael talked about this this interstate cross check system that is the brainchild of Crisco back and for listeners who may not know Kris Kobach was\nUm secretary of state of Kansas and who was the one who held and then the now inoperable a voter fraud commission task force that President Trump um impaneled then disbanded when he came into office\nRight well I think you know what Michael is reminding is is that you know we're still voting without the full protection the voting rights act\nAnd you know we saw this than twenty sixteen and we're going to see it again and twenty teens so that is a great concern\nI think what's going on Indiana and places like Georgia which is really troubling is that you know when we said just a dash is out of place and it can ... your name is completely annex bunch from the rolls that also disproportionately affects Latino voters who may have hyphenated last name\nSo that that hype and is not there and so there's a gap between the name then that person as it is expunged many people don't know that they're even expunged and so when they do go to vote\nThis type of a discouragement can also turn into a form of voter intimidation which we often time seeing in the south if we remember a brand kept also has a campaign ad with him you know rounding up my truck for him to round up all night\nAnd we quote unquote legal um I don't like the term uh but we've also heard stories from twenty sixteen about people going to the polls armed that will also discourage people so we have some institutional factors and some extra analogies that will disproportionately affects them and let's also remember when Stacey Abrams\nWorked for the nonprofit neutral and worked with a nonprofit the New Georgia project they registered over two hundred thousand Georgians over the past decade or so\nRanking is well aware of that and he he knows that he can't win it outright and says he has to make sure he takes people out of the race because things have us has been traveling the state of Georgia not just Atlanta and that just making into big cities to really make her case not just a black Georgians 'cause they're not enough\nBuilding eligible black Georgian but to poor people middle class people upper class folks all throughout the state and her message is resonating and that is why can't is is really moving forward that this pretty aggressive agenda to explain to people from the girls\nAnd and it's worth noting that Kris Kobach who orchestrated the system called cross checked where a ... it's it's supposedly says oh we think this person might be properly registered and it's full of errors and ... states have pulled out of it because of that Kris Kobach like camp is\nRunning for governor he is both the referee and the player and co back is\nA notorious as a hobby almost he he went around the country are trying to pass anti immigrant was here's been pedaling the false idea that there's massive widespread voter fraud in the United states and therefore we need to restrict\nThe right to vote in the commission that he orchestrated blew up the ... the White House commission or you the members of the commission began suing each other and it's if it's found no evidence of widespread fraud\nAnd even in his home state of of Kansas there was a lawsuit challenging his purge practices\nAnd the judge ruled against him and ordered him to go back to lawyer school to get remedial legal education because he had so botched this and uh it was quite an extraordinary rebuke of of his entire uh ... his entire operation\nYou know in July I Believe it was I'm Michael your center at the Brennan Center for justice issued a report detailing the national\nScope of voter purging in the u._s. you talked about some but how widespread are we talking is this a fifty state problem or is this the localized meaning is this just the south\nIt's nationwide and again removing names from the rolls is not necessarily itself a bad thing the voter rolls are full of ... and we want to make sure that\nOnly eligible people are able to vote and that it's accurate\nBut the way this is too frequently done all over the country is without\nAdequate notice to people to make sure that they are aren't accidentally removed and again in the south especially the states that were covered by the voting rights act very suspicious surge in purges\nAfter the law was gutted there are so many answers bipartisan answers that could fix this we have a voter registration system that is still antiquated\nNow Thirteen states have passed something called automatic voter registration\nA and Washington DC\nAnd under that system you're automatically registered to vote if you are interacts said with the DMV in your state unless you opt out\nAnd that makes it possible to keep the lists and keep them clean and keep them accurate and without so many of the problems and without the potential for manipulation a bipartisan which is what we're seeing now\nThat we're seeing these at this happened in Georgia Ohio Kansas Indiana North Carolina Florida all states controlled by Republicans um any states with a democratic governor a democratic legislature doing as\nWell I I can speak to from my home and the great state of Brooklyn [laughter] uh ... where for thousands of people were dropped from the rolls because of incompetence or worse ... local officials we need to upgrade and modernize the way we run elections if we take our democracy seriously\nI think you know we also need to remember that it's\nIt's not just Republicans I mean there are a lot of Democrats who also don't want to people on the role of either just because I find so many districts the primary is the election right so they don't want nobody who nobody's that they they add and they're they're happy with that too so we need to stay vigilant on across parties as\nWell Michael Waldman thank you very much for

from Parkland, Florida are ... cofounder of march for our lives\nAnd Ryan beach content creator for march for our lives the lady Ryan thank you very much for being on America on the line\nI think if I\nSay give 'em ... before I even started this this conversation I Want to\nThank you for your heart and your activism in everything that you've done since February fourteenth of this year you've done a great thing at such a young age and I was in Washington for march for our lives and had not seen anything like that\nIn my eleven years in the nation's capital\nAnd as everyone knows it was born out of gun violence prevention or was that was the the cause but it's become an even bigger than that and what are you working on now what's been the focus\nRight up a well the the focus so far has has definitely shifted towards as as you know mid term election is coming on November sex\nAnd we are preparing the young people in America as well as everybody else you wrote\nIn this upcoming election really just trying to educate as many people as possible uh we've been registered people uh since the time of the march and it's really just about expanding the electorate you that you know it's one fourteen\nYeah thanks for having me\nSo you're registered to vote you're going to vote\nYeah I'm a registered Democrat I'm a little bit of Florida and I go to the proper and I will be voting a general\nAnd and was there any ... who was there any issue that tells you that push due to register to vote for was it a heavy duty\nI I I don't think you can boil it down to one is you know there's there's a series of different issues that affect the state of Florida especially young people the the um part of the bringing me to the polls\nAre you focused on the on the gubernatorial race ... ... um ... current governor Rick Scott\nAbout food I think that it's critically important that we elect go I'm I'm a change the policies that are being propelled by the former minister ration of Rick Scott\nMhm yeah and I got that wrong Rick Scott is not running for reelection he's running for Senate it's wrong to Sanders who is the Republican the Republican nominee ah my apologies for that max thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nI think you ... ... and Ryan ... I mean that that's a lot of engagement of of young people that we've just heard from very knowledgeable about the\nRaces in their particular states in their communities but as you traveled around the country this\nSummer I'm ... how much after the did you run into among young people\n\nI mean if nothing else people that we thought too much ... you can find the ones that we met with American singer that people care enough to to be out there and I think that a lot of them did actually shipped air opinions from one of apathetic on as carrying the ones that we talk to you oftentimes and say\nOh well I didn't really care about voting our politics to for this but something about this just turn the air a connection there and that's why I Do this every day and that's already powerful south\nI I'd seen ten year olds who could talk circles around over half of\nCongress [laughter] like young young people I don't think the issue at this point it's just a matter of making it\nAbsolutely important it's easy for them to vote I Know a lot of schools have been putting measures and making it harder for college students to be able to turn in their ballots I Know in the state of Florida if you want to turn on the absentee I Believe the cigarette sure you have to give his I'd have to be identical\nTo your driver's license and I don't have that I don't know many young people who are able to copy their signature almost exactly and might just listening rules like that simplified next April for the younger people of this country to vote then we will have no problem\nAnd let me go to Luke
