Democrats do better\nNate from Milwaukee, Wisconsin before you're called drop you said you're voting both your hopes and your fears now and I want to know what they are\nSure um well it's a form I stayed a specifically whether or not we actually have a functioning democracy\nIn Wisconsin a we are one of those states that has been very heavily gerrymandered so our state legislature actually doesn't represent the people all that well because people can vote for one party and the other one's still holds power\nI'm Scott Walker if he loses this coming election uh will not be in the position to sign off on to another bunch of gerrymandered rabbits which he's indicated he will do if you get the chance and that means that will actually have um the other candidate will put together a\nSaid he'll put together a neutral party to reduce strict\nBut that means we actually have honest ... elections again which means that a lecture that sort of Wisconsin would actually be accountable to the public which I think would be great um there was actually a lawsuit about this it's still going on in the courts a guilt versus Woodford\nUh and if anybody else wants to look at it\nUm they're a lot of attorney generals who I think like rigged elections got in on that too I'm from places like Missouri from Ohio and Georgia which are in the news already uh because they filed a brief saying it's we should let states basically reg their own lecturing so there are people going to have a say which I think is horrible\nI'm for anybody who basically was honesty and the people's will to real\nName I wanted to thank you very much for calling in from Wisconsin and those actually one of the states that I talked to a former attorney general Eric Holder about in terms of his efforts to your point about redistricting\nUm the efforts that his national democratic redistricting committee is is working on a ... thank you again for for dialing back in and letting us know what your hopes and fears arm and a comeback to Dave and Kevin uh Dave\n... we were talking about you were talking about races in California I'm wearing slow vote counting could delay on the outcome help delayed the outcome of the midterms are there other races um whether to slow vote counting or whenever that could delayed the outcome of the midterm\nWell close races in general look we have a much larger battlefield have house races than we've had a the last several cycles we currently rate Seventy three races as competitive at the cook Political Report it doesn't sound like that many out of four hundred thirty five but it's a double the number of\nCompetitive that we had at this point two years ago the caller who who talked about the walk away and ... that are that Trump referenced in his tweet a or the other day um you know based on the evidence I'm thing democratic voters aren't really walking away from the party they would crawl over broken glass to set to vote\nThis fall and Republicans avid walked away from from Trump either a there is still with him the question is are they energize that they were in twenty sixteen because after all he's not on the ballot and neither is\nHillary Clinton than Hillary Clinton a spoof to a lot of Republicans into voting in twenty six ten so we're just not seeing that sense of urgency from the Trump base or as we did two years ago and that that is what's pushing a lot of these races towards Democrats\nAnd Dave I'm so you're at the cook Political Report you guys work in a crystal ball\nSo when do you think you'll have a good idea of how the night is going in terms of the balance of power in the house I just specific races that you're looking at that are that would be bell weather's you give our listeners them some inside\n[noise] I think we may have a pretty good idea of how things are going up early on and the first couple of races all be watching our\nKentucky ... congressional district in Lexington, Kentucky so that the district Trump won by ... points but the Democrat and a graph has been a tub running very close and impulse with a Republican incumbent Andy far she\nBecame a viral fundraising sensation where the the video um and then the other two races I think that that will give us a pretty good early indication of what's happening\nAre Virginia second and seven districts are in Virginia Beach and the Richmond suburbs respectively and the seventh district has a toss up between Dave Brat a Republican who beat Eric Cantor four years ago with a huge upset\n... name Abigail and Eric Cantor this was a big deal because\nOr cancer was the house majority leader correct ...

forty four count federal indictment of the murders of eleven Jewish worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nThey are labeled as hate crimes and um\n[noise] yeah this is interesting whereas the rest of my stuff I had more news here\nThat I've run over we're the ghosts ticket [laughter] you know\n[laughter] oh you know I you know as Maria I'm I'm I Can't even read my own my own writing because it says it right here this evening President Trump is preparing to send the even more troops to the southern border to block migrants from Central America from entering the United states listen to what he had\nTo say we have about five thousand they will go up any wherever we benefit the very first show on top of border patrol and everybody else is a far nobody's coming in\nGod I Love live radio and federal judges in Cincinnati today ordered Ohio to allow formally purge voters to vote in this year's election they had been purged for not voting over a six year period the state will not fight the order so Maria and Kevin I went to\nUm start this conversation by talking about\nUm [noise] the president this idea of sending ten thousand troops to the the southern border I'm In anticipation of the Central American migrants from Central America\nWell like I went to like a Stacey Abrams rally in South Philly a lot of energy there like she's got the ... just dry like thirty minutes outside of Atlanta and I just feel like\nThe energy and they're like she she kept ... here in Atlanta actually like to see like my college campus here but I just don't think I just don't feel like an energy is really kind of ... such a hot war thoughts mhm\nAll right ... thank you very much for calling into America on the line and in six in six days we will we will find out whether that energy that blue wave that Zachary is really hoping for um materialize is in Georgia and or elsewhere but my concern\nIs let's let's say it doesn't materialize 'em let let's say it doesn't happen on at that point for someone like Zachary um you know there's a decision to be made which is so do we just basically fooled our hands and say well\nThat is that or does it change the way that you relate to the politics and you basically you know doubled down in terms of the ... the discussion around democracy and participation and leave with his fellow college students maybe many of which may be or not fearful could care less so\nI just think you know we don't know what's gonna happen and I have a lot of questions I have a lot of questions about the polling into data I have a lot of questions but it's more like so if it doesn't if this thing doesn't happen then\nIt'll be more incumbent upon young people like ... who are disappointed too they they are too young to to throw up their hands Kevin I'm uh before I go to another call I Do want to jump into this fourteenth amendment or issue\nThe president brought it up yesterday and the birthright citizenship I'm ... ... tons of people from the speaker of the house on down said that's not going to happen that can't happen and yet the president is still today on Twitter today it's we just saying no no no I can do this I'm going to do this\nAs with the Fifteen thousand troops I'm to the southern border is this talk about the fourteenth amendment\nAlso a political ploy is this all about politics\nIn this nightmare scenario that we're talking about well that just disappear the day after the election\nI mean ... isn't going to let up on this um this is\nSomething he will probably try to use to fire up his base ahead of twenty twenty or even if it doesn't work in twenty teens are in the case of the fourteenth amendment issue yeah clearly\nThe vast overwhelming majority of legal scholars say he cannot do this this is not within his power um it's not even clear if there's something Congress could do so it's not clear you know if the president could do it by executive order\n'em then how's your alright ... disagrees ah one thing I Would note also on\nThis issue and sort of how it turns out Republicans one big problem Republicans had started during twenty seven scene in particular which Trump\nWas constantly getting into rap like that's what either Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and what that is that kind of in facts all the other congressional Republicans when Trump is fighting with opera it makes Trump's base\nWhich really at this point is the same as the base of the Republican Party not want to vote for congressional Republicans having a\nFight between of any type between the house speaker\nAnd the president a week before the election is you know in any other circumstances Brock Obama had been fighting with Nancy Pelosi a week before three dozen that it's all we would have talked about ... right off\nSo I think that is something where this could actually backfire a little bit on Republicans by sort of pointing out that the house Republicans don't really always agree with Trump who are the person most of the Republican base like\nUh I went to squeeze in one more call before we have to go to a break John calling from Cleveland Ohio thanks for calling into America on the line five\nFor Apple a\nAre you voting your ... ... voting your hopes are your fears\n... I'm voting somewhere down the middle of 'em even with the economy I I have to say I'm voting my pocketbook\nUh-huh and so is your pocket been told is that I I Love your voting your pocket book is that a vote based on fear or on on hopes given\nFor the economy the optimistic I'm going to be optimistic and say it's a vote on hopes okay I worked\nAs a public library at all and you know having been a young adult librarian some of the previous callers filled me with so much hope mhm um bought our budget is largely decided hey from our state budget here in Ohio and fee from local issues but\nGo onto the ballot now my library doesn't have an issue on the ballot this year bought\nOur state is up for a play with\nThe state house whip the governorship and I'm voting in hopes that after the budget cuts that we took him two thousand nine state house realizes the work that libraries have done and putting people you know getting people back in the job market and that they might ah states that they give us some of that money\nBack so does that mean you're going to vote for Cordray or you're going to vote for the wind\nWas you know while I Am\nMost likely to vote for Cordray ... I Will say\nAs far as governorships state of Ohio a on let's be clear when our budget cuts happened faith did happen under a Democrat a governor so I'm I'm In favor of who is more likely to restore\nPublic funding for public which\nAre right now for ... uh-huh my part right All right\nJohn calling in from Cleveland Ohio thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nKevin I think you might be you might be hanging around 'em so I'm not going to say goodbye just yet but when we return one of the toughest rough his campaigns in the country is in Florida that smart a governor's race will get an update in a moment and more of your calls again we're asking you if you are voting your hopes or your fears this election\nDemocrats Republicans independents give us a call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nThis is America on the line [noise]\n\n\nSupport comes from ... tunnel a Tuscan dining presenting the last of the local sessions wind dinner series for twenty Eighteen on November fourteenth destination Palermo reservation info available at ...
