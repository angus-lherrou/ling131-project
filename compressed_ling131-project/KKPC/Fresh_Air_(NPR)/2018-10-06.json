it go and it's life and we all have to do that at some point and\nIt's hard sometimes to do it in our culture because I think people are ashamed of getting older it's in a shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's point last saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so why [laughter] bother to hide it\nBut that still I think people are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions but when you're judged visually by your age I mean I'm sure that's one of the reasons why so many people\nGet cosmetic surgery you know ... yeah [noise]\nI've always been I mean I've always been proud of always been a while I'm this old never lied about my age level you know

and yeah I Am you know I sure am and I and I did but then at the same time he's the one that's okay now\nMaybe you should rethink doing this particular role or this particular thing and you know and so you know he's kind of the master of of time ... Mr time [laughter] [noise]\nWhat was your mix between anger and gratitude [laughter] about oh maybe it's no longer time for you to be doing this wrong and I think the role he was talking about was in the nutcracker which you'd done every year\nYeah I was surprised I went into the meeting thinking it was about something else I had no idea that this was going to come up um\nThis was hiding ballet master Peter Martin's\nYeah and because I hadn't had any real pain in my body I mean I knew I wasn't twenty eight anymore but at the same time I didn't I wasn't feeling pain and or boredom I still feel inspired and I'm so when it happened I was just what\nYou are you serious I shocked\nMe and then it hurt really really bad and I cried a lot for a while um and I think the shock was was what hurt the most is because I didn't expect it how long after that meeting did you get injured\n[noise] um that happened in I think October two thousand eleven and [noise] by um January two thousand twelve I had pain mhm [noise] so two months and the pain never stopped in different areas of my body\nFor four years wow that's a long time to be in the yeah yeah\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll shocks them or if you're just joining us my guest is Wendy Whelan who was a principal dancer with the New York city ballet for Thirty years she retired from the company and twenty fourteen after making a comeback following a hip injury\nThe new documentary restless creatures about that period of her life will be back after a break this is fresh air\nComes from National Geographic presenting free solo of film that follows clever Alex huddled as he prepares to achieve his lifelong dream of climbing a copy tune in Yosemite National park without a rope free solo ...\nTheaters support comes from ... media Boulder magazine you fall issue features fashion football art events and dining covering all the Boulder County since Nineteen Seventy eight on line at get Boulder dot com [noise] this\nIs fresh air if you're just joining us my guest is Wendy Whalen who was a principal ballerina with the New York city ballet for Thirty years\nIn twenty Thirteen I hit the injury led to reconstructive surgery in months of rehabilitation and physical therapy she returned to the New York city ballet for the spring twenty fourteen season and retired from the company that October afterward triumphant performance she noticed contemporary dance\nThe new film wrestlers creature documents that period of her life from her surgery to her comeback that period during which you worried about whether she would dance again and how leaving the New York city ballet would alter her identity [noise]\nHow did you get the hip injury that led to your pain into your surgery\n[noise] came out of nowhere literally came out of nowhere I um [noise]\nI slipped on ironically September eleventh two thousand twelve [noise] and um I knew something had happened it was the smallest lip and um but I felt it deep in my the back of my hips hamstring area [noise]\nAnd I thought oh I tore my hamstring or I pulled my ... I didn't imagine it would be a terror\nAnd I couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do and I waited a few months um didn't stretch it still damp but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I couldn't close for position\nAnd fifth position if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most basic position that everything moved from and I literally couldn't do that\nSo that was a big shock and I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried everything you can imagine had injections um MRI's I'm an MRI came back and said there was inflammation in my head\nSo I had my hip drained and the doctor also did an ultrasound and he said oh I see a complex labor will tear tear what do you mean a chair\nHow could I get a ... you know and I'm sure the chair was there forever I just didn't know it and until it was discovered and or had gotten to a place that it was um needing to be fixed\nSo I contemplated surgery contemplated everything I could do to avoid surgery and ultimately about Mm\nEight months later I was on the operating table getting reconstructive surgery the doctor didn't know to what degree the hip injury was when I went into the surgery and I'm a a one and a half hour or two hour surgery ended up being a four hour surgery and\nAfter the surgery I was a I couldn't wait there for two months was on crutches for two months and I was um [noise]\nVery often in a a machine that kept my uh the circulation going in my leg so that we could try to build new cartilage grown cartilage um I did the best I could do\nUm the footwork so when you get on a point you ... a ... you want to be able to follow through with that articulation and not have it break the line or break the movement or break your ability to express to the most\nWith that foot I think most dancers now start point work at twelve or so and all the way through your childhood and your and your young years you're trying to get that right shoot a fit you just write and to make your foot shape just right so it's honest [noise]\nTrue strong powerful gorgeous [noise]\nSee you started dancing at the age of three yeah him by twelve you were diagnosed with ... says how severe it was it\nUm severe enough that the doctors wanted to treat me for it with um traction body casting and ultimately a Milwaukee brace\nSo they wanted to halt the curve because if they didn't hold the curve when they found it the curve probably would've um accelerated to a place where I Would have needed surgery which ultimately would not have allowed me to have a ballet career\nSo we caught it really right at the crux of it either getting worse without treatment or halting and and uh respond to treatment and being a dancer a was a great thing the doctor told me back then he said the best things for ... says this was in Nineteen Seventy nine or\nNineteen eighty um our swimming and ballet is a great and therefore my body was flexible enough that it ... really responded to the treatment quickly I grew an inch and a half after a week of traction in the hospital and the doctors were thrilled and that really kind of\nPulled me away from the surgery side of things were as one of my my hospital room mate didn't get so lucky and she ended up having to get a a rod in her spine [noise]\nSo when you had to wear a body cast mhm how did how did you keep up with dancing\n[laughter] well\nI was in a Fifteen pound body cast I'm so imagine one of those down vest that you can get it north face or one of the [noise] basically that made out of plaster was what I Lived in for it ended up being a months at a time over five months one summer\nAnd in between each casting I Would go back into the hospital and spend a week in traction with a head alter on and leather straps holding my hips down towards the base of the bed and twelve pounds pulling on my head on his head Halter [noise]\nSo I'm In San ... uncomfortable as that was it really helped me straighten out my back and then I Would go into this body cast for a month for the time and my teacher said to me at the time living in Louisville, Kentucky she said you know you've done so well\nAnd I don't want you to lose your focus during the treatment right now so I Want you to come into the studio and your body cast and I want you to try to do whatever you can do we don't expect you to do this we don't expect to do that but just\nFeeling out move your body\nKeep your brain focused on what we're talking about
