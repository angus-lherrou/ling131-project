T. L. for a miracle on the line\nWe're going to begin with the latest news of the day and for that we turn to a ... who is Washington bureau chief for huff post thanks for joining us Amanda thanks for having me well let's start off\nWith the mess with a Saudi Arabia and we have a couple of a sound bites here here is the president who's asked a well you don't have you asked about that audiotape that that the Turks are apparently have showing or a recording the brutal murder and dismembered months of ...\nOr if it exists Russ [noise] no I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does possibly the uh I'll have a full report um it from my when it comes to\nYour mind being Mike Pompeo the secretary of state who wins to Riyadh and uh after\nA photo op with no smiling handshake so with the with the crown prince said that um he didn't really want to talk about the specific this is what the secretary of state said when he was asked well you know what did they say about whether democracy hoagie was alive or ... what what happened to him\nI don't want to talk about any of the fact that they didn't want to either him if they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation going to ... and I got I think there is I think that's a reasonable thing to do given that opportunity for them all just judge lawyer to evaluate the will sit there\nOkay so Amanda what was the point of that visit by Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia\n[laughter] I mean I think it was to give the appearance that the Trump Administration is taking this seriously a but it didn't really come off that way ... uh was shown in a photograph of laughing at a meeting with Saudi officials and the state department spokeswoman was\nUh put up on social media picture of herself sort of sightseeing and ... that's not a great luck\nWhen you are over there investigating ... death of this journalist and I mean the Trump Administration seems like they are right now looking for any way possible not to implicate the crown prince who has close ties to Jared Kushner for example a but it's becoming increasingly hard because all signs\nPoint to Mohammed Solomon the crown prince and being involved\nWell there there's there's global outrage about this a lot of pressure even from Republicans in Congress to do something about the murder of this Washington Post columnist\nBut the ... the headline in the Washington Post night says wait and see amid global outrage over 'cause she'll be trumped tries to protect the Saudis\nI think this is really upsetting not just journalists but you know certain members are definitely democratic elected officials that even some Republican officials who are finally starting to just wake up just to touch\nWe don't know if they'll you know pull a flake in sort of raise a red flag and then quietly sit down but they're saying is this actually\nDoesn't smell right in the sense that we cannot as a nation we cannot have\nA journalist going into embassies\nAnd dean brutally murdered that just cannot stand and it can't stand for president to say well we've got a lot of big deals cooking so what are you gonna do he wasn't a citizen that is absolutely not again I think finally they're going to be some people within his own party who say sir I think that this is actually a much larger case\nOn and we might need to put ... finances aside in an address it\n... I probably should have a more delicate transition now from from this really serious topic to to do to domestic politics\nNow that we're we're twenty four forty eight hours away and I want to you know T this up to you a ban um how did how do you evaluate the Elizabeth Warren rolling out of her DNA she seems to be right now under fire from both the left\nIn the right I'm clearly she thought this was a way to counter Donald Trump to prove that she fight how do you evaluate the success or lack of success of the uh of of the war in DNA roll up\nReal mistake on her part I think she thought it would play very differently than it ended up playing\nA statement in particular put out by the Cherokee Nation was was really brutal and and not something that I think she could have anticipated frankly I'm surprised but she did it it seemed like a big mistake to me to even engage on that topic um and I doubt that Democrats are going to take away\nA positive development on her part the other thing is I think the timing of suspect it doing this before a midterm election when you want the focus to be on\nAny number of different critiques of Republican Party and the administration middle it takes one more news cycle away from I think a lot of things that\nCould be used to increase the number of Democrats in the Senate the number of mistakes that I've seen happen on the on the part of of a was with one or the last couple of years does raise some serious questions for me about how effective she will be as a candidate and twenty twenty I think she'll still have a lot of support\n'em but you know she doesn't really telegraph the sense of of necessarily having\nA a real connection real an awareness of the way that things developing media which is we've seen now becomes an incredibly important aspect of what people believe qualifies you to become president Joan Joan Walsh what what about that did it backfire on or was it a mistake\nI think he did backfire I'm ... and that means I guess it is a mistake I mean I'm I'm going to confess I'm somebody who really loved the video when I first saw it so I'm going to stand by as some of that reaction\nUh I think what I worry about now is that it does seem like she did not adequately that this whole idea with native leaders ah I don't consider that the you know the statement of the Cherokee Nation leader is is is very\nDamning on the other hand the Cherokee Nation has had its own problems on on issues of race and inclusion or trying to kick out the black Cherokees or a few years ago so the but but it just shows you how fraught these issues are when it comes to right now in order to get a caller\nRight well I think you know I think what she was trying to do is say look Trump demanded Obama's birth certificate for eight years as did his wife by the way the millennia Trump is a birther as well and Obama produced a birth certificate and Trump denies it I think that she's possibly thinking that she could sort of show the receipt\nAnd then Trump would deny it and we had one on tape saying that he would pay a million dollars to charity and then sort of goat him into something like that\nI think exactly what John said part of the larger issue is she went ahead with this without fully consulting some of the leaders in the indigenous tribes and said that is I think that's the real mistake to\nLet this go look at the phones I asked the question earlier what is the one issue that live in a fire under you that is getting you up off the couch and voting let's go to a home more ths decoded Tim\nYou're on America on the line calling from Charlotte North Dakota\nLet's call them [noise] um I'm voting Republican and the reason is for one of the wall of the major reason is I question\nThe Democrats the house and Senate Democrats their legislative temperament as demonstrated by actions related to the Kavanaugh earrings and even with the house\nAnd Senate committee hearings\nOn the alleged Russian collusion business\nOkay so they they made their you know your your your temper okay so you're talking about the social capital is motivating you you are you saying you were not motivated before the Kavanaugh hearings or\nWhere are you willing to consider both parties and here they're here what they were going to say in there\nBut that's what you know the only up to the election ... foot based on what I saw and heard on this summer and and what am I counting on hearing was the icing on the\nOkay thanks for the call I appreciate it let's go to a New London Pennsylvania Anthony or you're on America on the line what is the one issue that is motivating you to turn out on November six\nFor me I think it's health care I think we have twenty million people who got health care because well I'm a care but I think they're very in danger of have sent me a really big life and death situation but I think on that advancing we call the universal healthcare going forward\nQuite so that's that is that is the one issue now would you describe yourself as a in generally motivated active voter\nNormally yes okay thanks for the call I preach listen thanks everybody we've got to go to a break when we return W. N. Y. sees high right has been in Georgia reporting on the ... razor close governor's race there in controversy over allegations of voter suppression he'll join us when we return you're listening to America on the line\n\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n\n\n\nThank you to leadership partner Lisa ... a significant investor in our community through her gift to CPR learn more about leadership partners on the individual giving page at CPR dot org\n[noise]\nHi I'm Stewart vendor will president of Colorado Public radio\nWe share the belief that trust in journalism is essential to help them our democracy and just as important music and the arts are essential to the health of our society [noise] CPR classical music art and the concert hall to wherever you are your car your kitchen onto your\nYour support make CPR classical possible for you for listeners across the state [noise] thank you for contributing to the civic and cultural health of our community by supporting Colorado [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm fairly psych skin for Jonathan Capehart tonight and you're listening to America on the line from W N y C and public radio stations across the country and grown more than a hundred and fifty stations tonight when I returned to the state of Georgia\nWere early voting is be gone with the race for governor there between Republican Brian camping Democrats Stacey Abrams is making national headlines\nIn front of the reasons if she wins Stacey Abrams would be both the first black governor and the first female governor of Georgia which is not elected a Democrat Tibet office in ... years meanwhile as you've probably heard by now\nSecretary of state Brian Kemp the Republican candidate for governor is facing lawsuits and the range of Democrats for initiating new order rules\nThat landed fifty three thousand voter applications in limbo there's another lawsuit against when it county for rejecting an unusually high proportion of absentee ballots and that county has one sixty percent non white\nSort of talk about all of this uh and more we're back with Joan Walsh national affairs correspondent for the nation and we're also joined bike high right hosted W. N. Y. sees United States of anxiety pot gas who's just back\nFrom a reporting trip to Georgia thanks for being an American ally thanks for every ... well let's talk about this uh Stacey Abrams what makes her different I mean obviously you know on paper for ... ... you know black female governor of the state of Georgia give me some sense of what makes her this distinctive\nWell first black woman to be would be the first by going to be governor of any state and the history of United States uh so you think you run out of things I could go we go all night on what makes our exceptional I mean there's there's who she is\nBut then there's also what her strategy is is a ... it's a if if she wins she will mark a dramatic change in the Democratic party politics for the south\nYeah mean up until now basically I mean there's the Democratic playbook is to run as a centrist right or you know picking up swing votes in the middle ... she's got a different philosophy\nAnd since twenty Thirteen what we have seen quite predictably is a a return to this patchwork of ways of suppressing\nSo we're focused on those fifty three thousand voters in in Georgia\nBut the thing about it is like it's not just those ... ... the the the ... campaign and and voting rights advocates have right we really focused in on that 'cause it's easy to understand and there is very specific people but there's a whole host of things at play which the Georgia has closed two hundred and fourteen precincts in the last four years doing for fourteen fully places and fast for years and so\nWhen it when we talk about clay county ... you heard in that clip from Stacey Abrams when I talk about the woman who who's who's doesn't have a car and she's trying to get out the vote\nHer point by says recently been moved it used to be down the street from our house and now she's got to go another twenty minutes to get to it and so it's there's this patchwork of things that is made voting in Georgia a lot harder than not\nNow my understanding is of course that these fifty three thousand votes are cast a provisional ballots yes you can show up but if this election turns out to be decided by one or two thousand votes then they go into you know some sort of legal limbo where you know you\nKnow that well they can't they get counted I mean it's my understanding is they\nGet counted but the problem is that they're vulnerable to challenge right I mean you want the the whole the whole fight here in the voting rights world becomes people who are trying to expand the opportunity to vote to get ... votes clearly in the bank get this is a vote that it does not have an aspect fry it\nAnd all of this sort of concern about voter fraud is about racking up the number of votes that have an asterisk next to them that are going to have to be litigated over and so that if you have a close election like you're going to have the most likely in Georgia\nThat there are as many votes as possible uh this is I Believe this to be true and certainly what the critics of the state which say that there are as many both is possible that you can fight over whether it's a valid or not\nAnd and and and so that's what really stands for these fifty three of those fifty three thousand people absolutely can vote they will see it's there they'll they'll receive a a\nI don't know the legal status I'm not going to get ahead of myself but there'll be able to vote but but the state will be able to challenge the Joan ... is that a\nVoter suppression yeah OK off depression\nBecause you're adding an extra hurdle to two people a ... for for a very arbitrary reason into it to go to ... bigger point in the states that used to be covered by this pre clearance requirement of the voting rights act they have literally kicked millions of beyond Georgia\nMillions of black voters off the rolls since ... twenty fourteen\nThey have literally closed hundreds of polling places in black neighborhoods since twenty Thirteen\nAnd they would not have been able to do that\nNot only are they were not if they do they try to enjoy the cake this is the case\nKnown as Shelby County versus holders\nThat one right this ... than I and this requirement that if you're a bad actor for you know Ninety plus years we we're going to ask you to submit your new plans for the way you're going to mess with the voter rolls\nTo to the Justice Department and we're going to say oh no that makes sense people moved moved to move the polling place where there's going to say no we see what you're doing a ... and it it's just no coincidence that all this change has happened and it's affecting black voters only in I don't want to say only in the states but we've documented\nWhat are you going to make them a worst case scenario for you know the village intimacy of a democracy if we start to have these elections that are decided by very very narrow margin in which a large portion of the population believes that there was voter suppression of voter fraud that they that they will believe that the system is fundamentally rigged against them\nLook we're coming to a head and this is where again I ah I think this this particular race is so important and instructive you know because you have two strategies planning out that are gonna that will that will\nBe in conflict for a long time where you have a Democratic Party that if if it switches to prospective like Stacey Abrams that says we're going to explain the span of playing field into these play into these ... and the state that we have normally ignored getting new voters out get\nA registered voters who don't vote often out a that have a lot of hurdles in their lives and living in the first place that are trying to expand democracy\nOr and you have a and certainly in the south the Republican Party that has\n... has spent the past decade saying you know the biggest problem with democracy is that people are cheating and there's fraud and so we're going to try to constrain it and those two things are going to be an absolute conflict and and and and they're going to be in most in conflict in places where you have a majority of voters\nWho are people of color and for Democrats and that's where the ... that's where this is playing out\nIt is but how will play out in in sort of the electoral college states I mean I I mean obviously you know one of the things when I first read it but ... why would why would the Republicans be willing to sustain the kind of political damage spend the kind of political capital on some of this\nHave they just made the calculation that the winning in those states is going to counter whatever the\nFull ... sellout is going to be I I think that's right and we've got a media the coverage that\nYou know are these fifty three thousand a voters critics charge they were they were you know they're they're about their obligations are in limbo critics charge the a P ... there's an expose a ... but the rest of the media was reporting it as a he said she said story\nThe media is not sufficiently ... educated about exactly what's happening so Republicans get away with it but when we talk about the electoral college to talk about your home state Charlie\nI Believe it was to something like two hundred thousand or maybe it was three hundred thousand black voters in Milwaukee could not get that I I'd rather we never bought that I ... ... you didn't\nKnow but but you're speaking of you know talking about turnout you know I'm I'm Brock Obama won Wisconsin easily um the right to defer the real difference was that the African American vote for Hillary Clinton was down dramatically and she underperform Rocco bound by by forty thousand votes Justin Milwaukee County\nHad they turned out for her in the same margin or she would have won the state of with our lives in ... so it was a new voter id there was a new ...\nLaw since ... it was like do we need to take another break and when we come back political
