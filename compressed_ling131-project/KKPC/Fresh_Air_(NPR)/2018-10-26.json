I Want I Want to make one data point here\nThe last time a Republican won this office was Nineteen sixty six that was out and you're ... I was born I mean it's been a while it's been a\nA very long time and the Republicans have feel like they've got a great shot fought mhm our poll showed one thing that that might give Keith awesome some hope\nThat there was plenty of undecided and one in five Democrats listed themselves is undecided in that race so for for them this might have been a wake up call that this is not a drill and they're really going to have to make a choice in key thousand has been this week trying to make that case bringing up\nThings about his opponent Doug war though and and how conservative e is telling people you might not like me but look at him\nYou know I was going to ask you about the the undecided but in relation to the the the run for governor but real quickly how much of the the Kavanaugh hearings um how much did that play into um the ... the poll plummet for Keith Ellison\nWell a lot of people use that to make the case that if you're going to hold him\nA justice now justice Kavanaugh too high standard Democrat you better hope Keith Ellison too high standard and if you turn on the TV there's a lot of ads for other races for Congress for a you know these competitive races where Keith tell us in his picture right next to the Democratic opponent so he he's a fixture in more than his own race\nI'm a real quickly in the in the governor's race will those that large percentage of of independence now the governors' races in is an open race because the incumbent governor Mark Dayton is not running for reelection and so you've got congressman Tim Walz and a Republican Hennepin County commissioner Jeff Johnson\nUm in in the in the past you get it from the past election results do you get a sense of where this big chunk of undecided voters might go I think it stands at twelve percent at least in one of the polls\n[noise] you know it's a great question and I wish I knew but but he you know this was a case where there is a Democrat running to succeed a two term Democrat that's never happened in Minnesota where that Democrat has won or the Democrats usually ah I see it quite a bit of a drop off in Minnesota in these midterm elections\nThis time they nominated Tim Walz who's a congressman from southern Minnesota and his had somewhat of a moderate record so\nThere is a really hoping that he can kind of carry some of those centrist voters who might\nLean a little bit right a Jeff Johnson has run a pretty standard Republican campaign he's echoing the president on some of these immigration topics and and ah cut government cut taxes and Tim Walz is has not really had to go negative on his opponent yet so he feels like he's in a good spot okay and\nAnd and and how when you and I were talking about Montana a moment ago but you've done a lot of reporting in from Idaho where Medicaid expansion is on the ballot it's a ballot initiative Idaho is they ruby red state what what are the chances of the ballot initiative passing\nReally high [laughter] and it's kind of unbelievable you know I grew up in Idaho and I watched it turned from a purple state into a bright red state\nAnd part of that and frightened redness has come from people moving in from California and other states with more fire right tendencies are more our ideologies\nWho and through election to the the state legislature I've really ensured that there was no way that Medicaid expansion was going to happen same for\nAnd the governor but you know that this campaign it's a grassroots campaign it's headed by and childhood friends from standpoint how a tiny town of north\nAnd they decided okay worked to get it on the ballot we're just gonna you know go door to door it gets support not through a huge massively paid campaign but trying to talk to people about what they call it the gaps so people can make\nToo much money um but not enough money right to get the sort of health care that makes living in a sustainable life in Idaho possible\nAnd the polling on it similar to the polling on Medicaid expansion in Utah is pretty strong and and it seems very likely that'll pass\nAnd both and candidates for governor but the Republican who will almost certainly when and the Democrat has said that they would not fight that if that measure passed so it looks like it will become a reality after this election\nSo are the Republican so are Republicans running ads I'm a ... in Idaho saying we support this in the way that we're seeing in races around the country where Republicans are actively campaigning on say on health care and in particular I'm thinking of you know we will protect a pre existing conditions\nWell you have some of the more moderate Republicans who have come out in support but very few I think that most people don't want to be and\nHad to in future elections as someone who had gone on the record supporting what is generally referred to sterilize the bomb a care right and a lot of that that ... anti proposition to messaging has been this has Obamacare\nYou are bringing socialism to Idaho you know I think like the messaging and Texas and in Florida has been like you're going to turn the state into another Venezuela and the people are the message in Idaho another Venezuela [laughter] yeah well\nHeld Peterson Jessica silver Brian back thank you very much for being on America on the line we have to take a break and when we return a conversation about the

I\nI really love the fact that it was lucky that all of these towns a lot of and smaller mid sized towns and thinking about\nLike what are people actually talking about and thinking about an optimistic about and I think that most reporters will tell you that when they're actually on the ground talking to people\nNot at political rallies they'll tell you something similar that there is a lot that's going on in their communities that they are really excited about and things that they feel like they can change meanwhile what's going on at the federal level feels\nSo distant and gridlocked an impossible and like there's these two realities that bumped up against one another on a daily basis\nI yeah uh do they bumped up against each other or they like magnets the opposite sides of magnets where they repel each other I'm always I'm fascinated by this seeming disconnect between the activity inaction on the ground locally and then the\nOther um halt of any kind of ... of action at the federal level\nOh yeah absolutely I think you're right and that's that they repel each other and that's part of that sensation of whiplash is that you're coming from one of those activities like you know the other day I was shadow in some people who were going door to door getting out the vote for the Medicaid expansion initiative in Idaho\nAnd like you know no matter what your political inclination known as rude like they had real conversations and then you come home and you are you look at your phone and you see what's happening rhetorically and in all other forms on the national level\nAnd it does feel like that if those national conversations make this smaller conversations to more meaningful one's more difficult\nBrian you're on the you're on the air every day five days a week and you had been you've been doing your show\nFor a lot a long time so of the three of us on a on the show right now you're the one who's got the most experience with just the the mood of the country in the mood of people um even in what people\nConsider the bubble that is that is New York city do you get a sense that the the drama that is the Trump Administration in Washington that it's not even ... even hear it doesn't have any kind of real impact because people are ignoring it\nNo people aren't ignoring A People's lives are affected by it um I don't want to make this out to seem like you know\nThere's just a nation of spectators who were choosing upsides and ruining like for the Dodgers are the red Sox in the world series people's lives are affected black people's lives are affected immigrants lives are affected women's lives are affected um intensely indirectly by\nThe way that Trump is too much without going into all those ways that everybody knows people feel personally threatened um so I I hear my call is being more inflamed and\nFrankly more afraid I'm Ben and all my years of hosting my show at least you know significant portions of the audience and I think that's very real and can't be ignored\nRyan layer and Helen Petersen we're coming back or ...\nA a longer discussion about a bunch of other things that have happened in the news today you're listening to America on the line we will be back after a break\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nI'm Dr Bob ... president of the lord and owner king from ... ... is a Colorado charitable foundation established by the state of lord ... king\n... mission is to recognize in support organizations that excel in serving the needs of our community we proudly supports CPR efforts to educate in the form or community\nJoined the ... foundation with the leadership partner level gift at CPR dot org Colorado Public\nRadio's daily email newsletter is called the look out it's a different take on CPR niche that's Daniel J Schneider every day he personally puts the lookout together\nAt the same recordings theories together you know solid knowledgeable but it's going to be more than that you were gonna shirt the broader Colorado focus that you don't get with any other newsletter or any single news outlet anywhere in the states\nSign up to get to look out your inbox subscribe at CPR dot org\n\nAnd Jonathan Capehart in this is America on the line from WNYC in public radio stations across the nation\nBack with my panel and we're taking your calls and again our question is what are you personally optimistic about maybe it's\nRelated to the election or something more personal give us a call at eight four four seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five before I even go back to the panel I'm going to put them off to the side because we've got Molly from east blind Connecticut\nOn the line Molly thank you very much for calling into\nAmerica on the line why are you so optimistic\nHey well I'm yeah I'm from ...
