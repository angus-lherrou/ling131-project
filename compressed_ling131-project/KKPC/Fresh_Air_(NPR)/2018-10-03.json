developments there's the progress of the FBI investigation of claims against judge Kavanaugh there's an update on Rod Rosenstein job status\nOh and the New York times is reporting that President Trump appears to have committed tax fraud\nAcclaim denied by Trump's lawyer and also by the White House statement that just hit seconds before we went on air from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders oh and now New York state is investigating so another typical slow news day\nLet's turn now to Washington Post reporter amber Philips amber welcome back to America\nOn the line and they're happy to be I'm\nOkay so let's take the the er the last thing first and that is the the latest response from the White House from Sarah Huckabee Sanders about this bombshell New York times story about the ... they're flat out calling it tax fraud\nOf not just a now President Trump but the entire Trump family\nYeah I'm I'm as you said it's coming out of four around the arson reading it right now it does not look like she Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaking out\nSpecifically denies the allegations are the key line here is many decades ago the IRS ... signed off on those transactions and then she goes on to attack\nIn New York Times or what that suggests to me is that there is not clear denial of the things that the New York times accuses\nPresident Trump of doing that being said New York times that quote Trump lawyer saying a or denying any allegations of actual fraud and ... and\nA new one of the ... one of the instant analysis of this is that it sort of blows a hole into the president's image or that he has perpetuated of himself as\nA self made a self made man who went from queens to Manhattan and made it big and made it bigger than even his own father do you think that\nI'm a vet um there were all of these guys who are many of whom were made a lot of money in self help books and self help pod cast a form in a and they started off talking about sort of weight lifting and things like this Mike ... who was\nThe mastermind behind the the pizza gay marriage ... right yeah that was my sort of itchy now works for him for wars but he is one of the kings of this man was fear them because they it was All right was coming together of that\nThat online presence with the white nationalist and so this aggrieved male identity thing has always been a core part of that and politics and that is Donald Trump's world that is certainly don't Trump juniors world that it's unapologetic we always been where he's gone from health and this has to be expecting\nA Lexus I just you know it's um something I Want to kind of correct in the question the way your post and and I think you're just drawing on the president's own words here is the idea that somebody young men should be afraid of being falsely accused student adjusted to say for being accused of something I I the false pieces is biased and the question I think\nAnd the president's perspective is that cabin eyes an innocent man who's been falsely accused of something which you know really doesn't jive even with the testimony we heard last week in which basically he\nActed like a person who wasn't so much being accused of something falls to somebody who's passed with more catching up with him and he was being held responsible for his actions is that there should be consequences instead of drill down even more specifically I think ... absolutely right pointing to the genesis of the Trump\nConstituency but also the fact that we have this reckoning with what it means to be particularly white and male and privileges in America\nAnd this idea that now maybe there isn't a separate set of rules for those people is coming into focus and that's very scary for everybody who's been in power this whole time\nAnd I loved that Kevin and talked about her to get into Yale with any help it created father is buried at Yale which again you don't just end up being buried at you you get that they they just ... the idea that that would not occur to him to be a privilege is what was so interesting to me in that moment the unseen\nLet's go to coy in Asheville North Carolina coy thank you for calling into America on the line\nThank you for having me I just wanted to say a couple of things number one uh I think President Trump's remarks were totally off color and a toned up of the situation that being said I was accused of sexual assault in college\nI started dating a girl who my friend told me was that news at the mental issues um but you know I thought you straight show of where you were dating and one night we you know and it got drunk and um [noise] the next day she called me and said that I had sexually assaulted her\nAnd my person any reaction was only\n... you still there I mean\nYou're you're you're breaking your brain can you hear me\n\nOkay looked like we we have lost the last coy um who is\nA said that he thought that the president's comments were tone deaf I'm an off color but was relating his uh his experience of being falsely accused of sexual assault\nAnd we didn't get to the the the finish that story let's go to Christine also in North Carolina in Greensboro North Carolina\nChristine welcome to America on the line\nSo thank you good evening so go ahead\nNo your caller is what's on your migrants did\nA couple of things that I Want to talk about like the fact that I think in terms of the President Trump's statement at an early ... and ludicrous that he would think that we don't have the justice system that can weed out\nFalse out on our nation's sexual assault so I suppose they are an educator and the United states and as a victim of sexual assault\nIf I had made a false claim on I Would hope that our justice system is competent enough to\nFind those things just like if you were like you said murder rhymes or I of grand theft auto anything of that nature those things will be without the judicial system and as the president of the free world\nIncreasing your second ... and the second point\nThe second point is that he I'm going on with Alexis at an all access um\nElections Grinnell sat on which which is that his statements should be that it is a scary time for white men in America\nBecause that point of privilege not being accused never be questioned that good old boy and then tally it's finally on crank going at it seems and this has been seen by\nAll other um groups that have been marginalized that this is a problem for that this has nothing to address and finally the curtain on being put out from underneath them and yeah it is a scary time could on but it because the court has finally been polled on\nChris eating right and our odd Christine I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line we've

country that was moving toward being divided and make its just create chasm between us\nAnd I don't know how that gets better I mean I think we're resilient enough of the short term does to deal with it but some of the long term ramifications of water use the word truth is the truth is no alternative facts of the source is truly that was\nWell we're going to say and we're going to keep talking

yeah I think so because they're a pecking\nOrder and men are higher in the pecking order than women are very it\nWas kind of he said kind of both which is was interesting uh it made\nIt it made me very curious to hear more about that because he actually called in very willing to have the conversation in a way that we're not having that conversation nationally and when I referred to the fact that there needs to be sort of spaces and constructive places in which to discuss the stuff we don't have that at an adult and some sort of public discourse right now\nOn a in Beverly New Jersey has

about time that young men no matter what happens with the Kavanaugh situation and everything else the young men in our society start thinking the way young women\nHave been thinking for hundreds of years and I what I Do right now can be kind of facts you\nOn a thank you very much for calling into America on the line I mean that right there guy you you were reacting\nCapsule age than I Am that's that's exactly right you know I mean to the point is that we as a society are we've reached a place\nA where women and people\nOf color in larger and larger numbers are no longer willing to accept that we're the only people who are going to carry the burden of America's problems that we're not whether they'd\nBe cultural economic political that we're not going to be the only people to carry the problems and so we have called the question on a whole lot of stuff you know and prior to this\nIs the dream the dream movement is calling the question on the way we do with immigration black lives matter started calling the question of the way we do with black bodies and in the last years really since Donald Trump's election but certainly in the last year women of all races are calling the question on on on men and their entitlement to women's bodies and so\nYeah that is going to cause some conflict um but but hopefully\nThat conflict in will get us into a different place\nOnly real quickly to bill in rich in New Jersey who's called into America on the line bill\nAre we doing good so ... go ahead\nOh no that's pretty much the government this ad and tired of it is kind of funny

possibly going to change after this election and so you\nGuys have no moral ground to stay and you had an aunt who held the seat open for fourteen months who didn't give Merrick Garland a hearing so to say that\nDemocrats are doing with me that that that is a rural straying I'm saying that you guys are being hypocrite that's all I all I Know is that the\nDemocrats held onto a letter that they had for weeks and weeks and decided not to suddenly I think by the way as senator Coons said let's just do a one week investigation\nAnd it's like okay we'll go along with act as a Democrat senators on the judiciary should do it now we all agree to that and all I'm hearing from the the Democrat just oh my gosh where did this crazy idea of that should only be that's well came through one of you know the differences of all images on\nA bike I mean I just want to jump in I was and I think it's it was this is good this is worth listening to the good debate um were running a little bit out of time I appreciated fashionable side but I Want to talk about the um the New York times\nInvestigation that came out yesterday of course the president a Rand saying that he was a self made billionaire this investigation is claiming that his his fortune came from his\nFather are pretty much exclusively deliver tax questions possible fraud involving his father's money a Trump says it's an old story and boring John your thoughts were did anything about this strike you\nWell first of all again to surprise that the president uses puffer and hyperbole described himself as is certainly nothing noon and we can expect that future but here's the key if our economy was in the tank\nAnd people were making the argument oh my gosh we we we we voted for this guy based upon we thought he was a great business success story he's a failure in that business and now he's ruining the economy\nBut the truth of the matter is the economy is incredible I mean we have the Federal Reserve's sane is firing on all cylinders we see wages going up we see unemployment and Hispanic and African American low\nIn you're going to have us so we're running out of time and I I don't know how why why Israel said it next time [laughter] younger even to the Republican strategist I could change on the other democratic\nStatus that is all we have time for it but there is only the next time so thank you both so much thank you guys thank you didn't get to NAFTA and get to the mid term it's here now\n\nMetro weather churns sunny and warm or today before cooling off again for the end of the week\nThis is CPR news highs

George Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize\nLet's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university uh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test tube explain that\n[noise] so first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates\nThere they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOf the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery and the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\nWell or being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that sell live through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside his ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this work significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a a simple cell as we might think of it and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry and a beaker flask\nWe control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we all Timothy observe\nBut then you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so\nIt's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker\nAnd I'm the real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur in the next generation as opposed to waiting for the slow evolutionary process as it is really what so spectacular here and\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals are what are some of the real world applications of this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but\nTo be able to ask that sell\nAnd apple pod cast\nThis this year and now from NPR and WB you are I'm Peter O'Dowd\nFinally some good news for Tesla the electric carmaker announced this week that it hit a key production goals fifty three thousand new model three vehicles and the third quarter and that's in line with what Tesla had told investors to expect so one promise kept\nIn a much needed break after CEO you on must decision on Saturday to step down as chairman of Tesla and pay a fine for tweeting about his plan to take the company private\nLots to talk about what's bringing Claire Sebastian business correspondent for CNN she joined us now from New York Hi Claire Hi didn't Tesla has struggled a lot to hit production goes over the years we've talked about that here on the show so how big of a deal is this news that it's finally hit that mark\nWell let's get nice you know this is something that they really needed frankly in the recent questions over that credibility particularly when it comes to communications with the market and you know unless I\nWas very bullish about this over the weekend he sent a message we know to to stop an email saying that they just give it one will push and they were very close to profitability in times of whether this means they will it probably been in the ... dam unless they're a bit divided on that\nSome say that that it does show you know that this this is a helpful or\nYou know data point in the past ... at the others are worried about the challenges the company is facing when it comes to deliveries we know that must be in the past and so it was about production hell now he's been talking about delivery logistics hell he called it ... and that did show up and the number the bet they had a backlog of the vehicles listed in transit about twelve thousand of them that's less than that I could\nBut still significant number so I think that's why we see for the second day running now after that initial busted enthusiasm on Monday the stock price is down\nAnd just to note about profitability test was never had a profitable year\nThat that's true and and add there at the silk question hanging over this yeah mosque has promised repeatedly that that in that cool down the fourth quarter they will show a profit and they will be cash flow positive and they said he said the topic of the weekend that was very close to that and they've been cutting costs as well as increasing production they've laid off nine percent of that stuff\nThat we saw recently that they ... some of the color options available for the motor three to cut costs as well but but Castro is still a big issue for this company they put that coming Jupiter in November and some next year so it's they're getting the profitability Seventy from the unless you've covered this that I've been speaking to a is not something that they see as guarantee\nYou listed a lot of the reasons why the headlines about Tesla are often negative so let's talk about this one earlier or the SEC settled a with you on a mosque after he had this tweet the claim to have the funding secure to take Tesla private\nThere are reports that must have threatened to resign at one point if the board decided to settle so some last minute change of heart some drama do you think that to us a Tesla in mosques are ready to put that\nBehind them I mean do you think it will do much long term damage\nI think they were extremely ready to put that behind and we saw how much of an overhang hadn't stuck\nBy the fact that it went up Seventeen percent on Monday or that they said it has come back down again that's not the only overhanging they have this still a department of justice investigation that that is hanging over then that could potentially lead to criminal charges although some experts I spoke to said\nThat the settlement with the SEC potentially makes that less likely I think the ... not ready on the board there have been questions throughout all of this about their independence we know that there are several uh old friends of my not to mention because\nHis brother they now have to pick any ... people are looking at that and hoping that it will be an outside of someone who can re to\nKeep my account of of the story will go on ...
