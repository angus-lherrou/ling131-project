Democrats is dangerous which instead of an interesting in version of twenty sixteen rhetoric and obviously as a pretty full schedule out there right now\n[noise] um one thing that we're we\nHaven't been talking about and in any of the world this would be major news that was the un report that came out yesterday warning that climate change is happening\nMore rapidly and with more serious consequences than anyone had fought I'm the president said he wants to look at and this is what he said who drew it\nThat's what he said in his in his words is this un report do you think something that um the Trump White house and the president particular will take seriously\n\nYeah it should have been amazing combat and it's sort of amazing how much a story like that it's just not making traction over the un over\nUm Nikki Haley over the election um you know climate change is one of the issues that scene perennially the sort of boiling but never really get to the point where it's the main story today and it hasn't really bad and maybe the Paris accord so you know it's hard to see what's going to change\nA and one more a sin to leading issue to talk about speaking of the election going back to the election Taylor Swift\nAnd the power of his rallies ones that you saw on TV in two thousand and sixteen is that you saw them on television I mean it was I'm sure a great high for the people in the room who support him but also he was providing these huge blocks programming to cable news and right were broadcast all over the country to many more people\nFor a number of reasons including that his administration is doing all sorts of things that are that are news if you turn on CNN or not you're not going to see his rally live or you're much less likely to the new were\nTwo years ago [laughter] John where you get a ... year oh your fingers were I was trying to say that you do it I I Hope so I Hope that\nAs I said I I'm not looking yeah you're right we're not we're not looking I mean you know we all I think\nSome of us thought maybe they wouldn't maybe the cable networks and I work for CNN I Love CNN uh but maybe the cable networks wouldn't carry the whole victory lap with Kavanaugh live last night although I Would argue that it was newsworthy in itself\nRight I mean it is the swearing in of a new justice and the White House by the president and an incredible\nExercise in ... white male grievance and year you were found innocent justice cabin on ... I Apologize on behalf of the nation which includes you and me and then John\nYeah which is why I I did a campaign rally as opposed to a a solemn national event I didn't even give out our phone number eight four four seven four or five eight to five five if you want to join in on the conversation but that didn't stop Donna\nIn Everett, Washington from calling in Guyana thank you for coming into America on the line\nThank you for having ...\n... what do you think about all this\nWell I I Would like to say that Trump a tactics to win the election or not a factor as he did not win the popular vote he only won the electoral votes so apparently the electro college is susceptible to his tactics but the population is locked\nAnd I also want to remind you that there are more women in this country then our our ...\nTrue but as as we have seen there's a huge chunk of them who voted for the president's\nYeah that may be changing this election at least for the terms that the judge Kavanaugh saying we really was I think ... I opened our first on women not to trust these are old men on the Senate I think we need a a term limits\nAre I'd done I'm gonna have to leave it there 'cause I Want to thank you very much for calling in to America on the line Donna in Everett, Washington let's go to the middle of the country I'm Claire in Madison, Wisconsin thank you for calling into America on the line\nHi Jonathan thank you I Love your show by the way you\nI'm I Am seeing a trend and you discussed it you touched on it a little while ago [noise] uh it's very disturbing to me if Donald Trump Mitch McConnell and others are going to start it kicking these women who have\nCome out in light of the Brett Kavanaugh issue and if they're going to get picked us as a bunch of hysterical truth which they came very close to saying yesterday I think they're making a huge mistake number one and number two it just proves they don't get it\nNow clear yesterday we had um her name is escaping me but I Believe she was also calling in from Wisconsin Linda\nThat's right Linda from Wisconsin is she called in and she took the complete opposite view I'm from New where she thought that you know what the president's right she is afraid for her for her sons being Ron falsely accused of of sexual assault\nDo not think that that's a actually a a real sentiment out there among women\nUm if you brought your son's up properly to respect other people's wishes and their bodies you shouldn't be too afraid that your son is going to do something as stupid as that and number two Jonathan are\nAbout to perch such a report rates get convicted so the odds are real anyway\nAre right Claire in Madison, Wisconsin thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nSo I Joan I mean it\nGive Linda yesterday and and and clear today I like I'm In in the ... in terms of right thinking right but when you hear someone like Linda who called in and she wasn't that she isn't the first person to call into the show and express that sentiment\nIs are we to discount the windows of the world I don't know we don't discount them we listen to them Johnathan and we also remember\nThat fifty three percent of white women and I'm assuming that window with white from Wisconsin since I went to high school and college their love Wisconsin love y'all don't you know don't yell at me I assume she was white and you know white women went for Trump but you know I'm with Claire I have a daughter\nWho has a fantastic boyfriend I have nephews I'm not worried about them they're they respect women I mean this idea that your boys are at risk\nIs ridiculous and I also want to join into what Claire was saying about the use of the term mob about women who were indeed emotional many of them sexual assault survivors I saw a mob in Charlottesville I saw mobs\nIn the Tea Party I didn't see any mobs in the Senate those men were not afraid of their physical safety unless they're tiny little man baby cowards [laughter] while\nJoan ... we're we're

one word ... from Colorado Public radio get it wherever you get your body [noise]\n\n[noise] Jonathan\nCapehart and you're listening to America on the line we're back with Joan Walsh of the nation in buzzfeed's Ben Smith so for all the talk of a blue wave a takeover of the house and maybe even the Senate there are complaints that the Democrats don't have a unified message and so my message to both or do they need one band\nBasically not I'm In mid term maternal elections are typically\nTo somebody you know they're driven by dislike of of the of the ruling party this case you know Donald Trump the house the Senate and that gives Democrats room to run very different campaigns in different places\nAnd so you see a Democrat in West Virginia run a campaign in which he supported Brett Kavanaugh for instance ... Democrats in Florida and Georgia running kind of a much more progressive campaign you've ever seen there and I think you know you you're going to see a very very wide range and\n... and who wins and who loses in there we'll we'll we'll say it will shape the party going forward drunk\nI mean do do are are Democrats running national races or or to pick up on Ben Ben with her or highly localized races or a combination of the two\nI think they're mostly localized I I just spent two weekends with Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA you know watching her talk about Medicaid expansion which is actually popular among sixty percent of Republicans are watching her barely mentioned even her opponent Brian Kemp\nAnd not mentioned I don't think ... I should be careful I don't remember her mentioning Donald Trump even once seriously she talks about ... cradle to career education she talks about losing eight million dollars a day because the state did not take federal money to expand Medicaid\nOr it it's it's a national race there's a lot of national attention\nThere's national money on both sides but as she goes from you know appearance to appear and she's talking about why Valdosta doesn't get the same tax benefits or flexibility\nI'm such an immense piece of this country politically culturally and racially for that matter it it all off in amounts to a whitewashing when they're talking about the um the working class that I'm a native of in this\nPart of the country so are the problems exist on many levels I think\nAnd and that's what I I Love about your book I I I mean I admit I didn't read the entire thing but I've read big chunks of it and what I came out what I boost appreciated was you'd sort of lifts the veil off of a narrative an American narrative that\nBeing being poor and the situations that\nQuote unquote war get themselves into our situations that are the the sole province of people of color and African Americans in particular and what you do in your book is make it clear\nThat no no no no these are the situations that um the poor ... large\nOur mind them so what are they are living in and um I don't know I guess as someone who writes about politics and writes about race\nUh often that I actually found myself very appreciative then your story is one that takes into account\nUm that what you were living in the living through and what people of color are living through our one in the same it's just your prospect you're coming at it from your perspective as a as white and as a white woman\n[laughter] yeah I mean you know I don't think that I cast as went so far to say one in the same because the um the particular thing about my experience of poverty at a white woman is that um you can as I say in the book simultaneously have racial privilege and economic disadvantage\nTo I Would not put my ... and I don't think this is what you're suggesting but I wanted to be clear that I I Would not put my experience up you know next to a woman of color who was raised in poverty and say we had the same experience However I'm there certainly are more commonalities and and then one would\nHave gleaned from mom and dad\nYes sure um you know political discourse there's often very artfully leverage to divide people on color lines I'm\nA among the poor\nUh is is a incredibly destructive for for our country and\nUm you know it's been very heartening for me the last few weeks on book tour all over the country and having people of all backgrounds and colors and even political persuasion come through signing lines and say um our story is different and yet it's the same subtitle on my book is\nUm a number of working hard and being broke and the richest country on earth and and while there are different strata of disadvantage and privilege with within not experience it is a shame fully a common one in this country\nYou know that gets something this is what I was thinking of when I'm I've struggled to find a word commonalities with you you grew up in Kansas and the Nineteen eighties in the Nineteen nineties when President Reagan was in office and convincing America that government was the problem not the solution and he used terms like welfare queen\nThat have an impact on how your family and other working for Kansas you government social program\nYou know I think it did that a language of course had had and what's\nCode in some ways for a a really um a racist take on the role that government programs uh serve in this country and in fact most people in this country on public assistance are white just Enron numbers\nOn but a lot of that discourse in my during my childhood was ah was really targeted specifically at African American women I didn't have the political savvy\nTo understand that in my largely white rural place and all I understood was as a bunch of single poor moms in my family and I and I understood that we were people who would qualify for such programs and and I also understood therefore that there must be\nSome shame inherent to seeking such assistance and and that was absorbed deeply by by the the women specifically in my family I think\nOf one of the narratives that comes out of the election is the notion that from capitalized on the fear of the other\n... and ... which may be just another word for bigotry and you write a lot about um the other or euros vividly about what it's like to be white and also other than you in the less than two minutes that we have exchange expand on that\nSure where when I was I'm not just the first from my family to go to college but the first from my farm house to to finish high school so when I arrived on at a State University even and I was I sense that I was at the\nUh on a lower rung up some economic pecking order and and I was really um different for being having a rural background and coming from a place where people broke their backs with manual labor and and didn't get a chance at such things like a\nCollege degree so um so that's really when I came into kind of a class awareness um when I was a kid I I never would have used the\nWord poor about my experience because I I had enough to eat and I had a roof over my head but it turns out that what that is what I was and um and so it is of a particular kind of other that can be physically invisible but uh that's a experienced by um by millions of Americans right at this moment\nAnd real quickly in the less than a minute that we have left or do you give a quick uh an update on how Kris Kobach who's doing in his gubernatorial campaign against the Democrat Mark Kelly\nWell I haven't seen any recent polling uh but I Do now\nBut that on his opponent Laura Laura Kelly had a a fierce and

seven four or five\nTalk get Craig and Charlie welcome to America on the line Charlie welcome back thank\nI'm Craig let me start with you I'm clearly Governor Walker's reelection races that the high high profile race in the state and your latest article you report that while Walker has strong support from the conservative base he's struggling\nTo reach voters in the middle why do you think that is and why are swing voters so important in this race\nWell there are important because Wisconsin's a really evenly divided state [noise] they swing by definition Scott Walker is always one independent voters in his victorious campaigns but he's losing them right now so his problems really go to sort of\nWhat we call it sort of true independents people that really don't lean toward either party but he also has a problem with with kind of soft Republicans independent leaning moderate Republicans a lot of these people\nBelong to that minority within the party that have major qualms about Donald Trump and the polling shows that they're supporting Scott Walker but by much smaller margins than the party base and they're also you know not very mobilize there are a lot less enthusiastic about voting so\nHe's got a problem with soft Republicans and he's got a problem with independence is partly has to do with Trump partly also has to do is you know running for a third term being around for eight years having run for president right after winning his second term um he's got a lot going on there well\nAnd they pulled back there on their bow hand [noise]\n\nThe coffee tend to be black white and gray so the only thing the fisherman can see at night or the fishes white blips\nThey will be just swimming around right underneath the water's edge and there'll be opening

the four types of Asian carp graphs black silver and they can\nJust kind of hit them wherever you can once again or whether it's eight pounds or eighty pounds it's a pretty good fight they ran hard and they pull hard and you can wear yourself out and shooting victims\nAsian carp were introduced to the U.S in the Nineteen sixties and seventies to control algae blooms and parasites and fish farms but some carpet escaped and made their way into the Mississippi River delta in the late eighties and early nineties from there they slowly migrated into Tennessee water\nJoe Nichols hosts fishing tournaments like the ... on a regular basis he's seen firsthand the damage Asian carp can do over Eighteen years me doing this I've seen him like\nOf all it's like a plague I hate to say it that way but that's literally how it is\nFor our water systems the Carr Fire I'm rest of growers they eat the plankton nets at the bottom of the food chain from many native species when they move in they pretty much starve out the other fish in the ecosystem there also a threat to voters making way up to sixty pounds and when they jump they can hurt passengers years in damage equipment\nSo tendencies wildlife resources agencies if you've got to you All right just trying to control the Asian carp population vantage of a growing commercial fishing industry there harvest the car to turn into fertilizer\nWas only three four years ago they were\nHarbor some fish and the tens of thousands of pounds of years than it was a hundreds of thousands of pounds a year now they're talking millions you know getting over a million to remove\nThat Frank ... she is a fisheries for the the WRX the agency will spend half a million dollars to develop new markets for the car beyond fertilizer like getting more of them into a restaurant but office would do with the population down the thing it from spreading\nThe different challenge that Tennessee and Kentucky are working with the federal government\nThat's not new technology to keep the carp and think\nThey're bringing in sound barriers to test as far as we began to see if we can keep fish would come and\nIf that successful there's then we have a tool that we can use your teenage boys throughout the whole basin\nThe sound barrier place loud noises and here's the fish away from them up keeping them from moving\nFurther into the river system all of these efforts than your knowledge either are content to end the fishing tournaments will get expensive and because the Asian carp problem is considerably worse than some northern states that's where the federal government has focused most of its attention Mike butler\nIs a CEO of Tennessee Wildlife Federation a nonprofit conservation group you know there needs to be a discussion about how the U.S government distribute aid\nIn terms of federal funding to address the\nIllinois get most of the money to address or Asian carp and they've got a pretty significant challenge trying to keep them out of the great lakes now I think that moving forward [noise] there's gotta be some support given to shout eastern states that are dealing with this challenge like Kentucky and Tennessee and some others\nCongress recently passed a bill with a bat eleven million dollars to manage the car population but it's unclear how much of that goes to stay in the south and even with the funding the problem for states like Tennessee is not going to be solved quickly [noise]\n[laughter]\nBack in the tournament votes and fisherman came back from the lake with our hot but Seventeen thousand pounds of cars\nBut that's just a drop in the bucket not enough to make a dent in the overall population Asian carp in Tennessee at for now all of a state officials and fisherman

campaigns have the opportunity to really show their muscle during the storm\nIt's funny because there's so many other issues that these people have been campaigning on all along and now this storm could really change the dynamics of the race house certainly\nAnd and Governor Scott when he ran for governor and twenty ten when I worked for him his ah\nHe had three priorities that was jobs jobs and jobs and he said that once he said it a thousand times and\nAnd that is what he's been able to provide for the people of Florida and and has a good record on that but also what he is as done speaking of natural disasters the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico a lot of those residents did come into Florida and our\nWhether they're taking up residency or or they're spending time there Governor Scott has done a tremendous job of\nMaking them a welcome providing the resources that they need and that will go a long way to\nTo not just providing for the people there but the Hispanic community that is so critical to that vote in the Senate race so so his ability to to provide for people everyday citizens of Florida but also stepping up to the plate\nNot just with compassion about what the resources necessary in a natural disaster\nGoes to show what kind of The Crossley ID Guide would have been me has one more thing to say which is\nAbout the the path of the storm um probably is more hurtful to the Scott campaign just because those are more Republican parts of the state\nThat are going to be impacted and those people are those citizens are going to be very preoccupied by that I'm also hearing which is very tough the safest campaign loss of negative ads today on the Gillum campaign which just seems to me it would be very toned up to go after your political opponent with new advertising while so many residents\nHave there or have their lives hanging in the balance\nOkay just in the minute that we have left here sorry Alice let me just get to one other thing because it's important to which is a Mitch McConnell is calling the people who have been protesting about Cavanaugh a an angry mob\nAnd it it brings us back to the Tea Party which came to power after doing the same kinds of things at town hall meetings in twenty ten during the debate over Obamacare a ... is it the same thing\nOh I I Do think it is the same thing and not only that McConnell called the attacks on a judge Kavanaugh as coming from a mob when they were just people standing outside you know voicing their opinions and being arrested and peaceful protest\nBut the people inside of a of a political rally shouting lock her up to a political opponent of what the president United States smiled and reaction of that's not a mob\nLet me just say this to tea partiers never went into Iraq private restaurants in case senators out of out of restaurants on their on their private time and what we're seeing these protesters and the Kavanaugh situation chasing out Senator Cruz banging on the doors at the Supreme Court and and chasing Sanders down the hall that is mob mentality okay\nGotta leave it there our student Jamal Simmons thank you\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThere's more rain and light
