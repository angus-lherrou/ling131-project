I I Want to play something that I'm John Brennan said today or one of the people who was targeted for one of these pipe bombs and it gets to what you're talking about and also what Charlie has been saying also Joan\nIt's very important for an individual who is in the oval office today\nTo say exactly about that we need to come together as a country we need to unite you may have differences but this should be no reason whatsoever to resort to these types of acts of intimidation of testing violence I sincerely wish adult from\nThough would have said these things previously and regularly I Wish he would have encouraged people from all different backgrounds and political affiliations to come together\nJoan I ... I wanted to play that because it's sort of sets it it sort of frames nicely with what we've all been talking about here if you want it to jump in before I did that\nI did I mean I just wanted to add since we're we're you know we're all a little bit behind here and we're talking to each other and trying not to look at TV or anything else but I did get the tweet a and apparently the the president added to his warm you know calm words\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and stop endless hostility\nAnd to me that's blaming the victim\nI mean the media did not bring this on CNN did not bring this on itself\nSo that again and he kind of walk it back when I had again he's putting his heart is back on us on ever he is very ... very conscious very consciously it's another both on the side or ism but it is completely immoral and you know we shouldn't expect any better\nBut we've also got a call it out that is just outrageous\nSee I Am I'm I'm One of those people who has or I I've watched the president\nAnd I've ... I've grown accustomed to the rhythm that is President Trump and that is something happens he says the right words and then I click a stopwatch to wait to see how long it takes for him to defy the scripted words and\nSo even Charlotte you don't have the right thing for a while\nAnd so and so here we are and that sort of leads to the question that I was the next question I was going to ask which is what is the ... what is the presses responds to bill I was going to ask that Joan before you read that where you read that sweet I'm the president saying it's\nOur responsibility but is it the presses responsibility here\nAre our responsibilities to tell the truth\nAnd by and large we do and what he could you know considers and demeaned as fake news tends to be accurate news\nHe has gone on a spray of lies in the last week or so I mean we really we I Can't believe it but the old the old Trump or with a little more mellow and now is that we have a neutron who is you know Ninety percent more racist and then ...\nCharlie struggling so I like that or you know he's ready for the midterms and he's bringing in white nationalism and so he keeps escalating and to suggest\nThat perhaps we brought this on ourselves because of our endless hostility is just complete BS\nAnd we've got to look at it so I found one yet Charlie I'm you'd get in and then in April of give you the last words\nAs one of the follow up on this you know I I obviously we we need to focus on Donald Trump but it but I also think we need to focus on what he has done to the political culture and big influence but he's had on his supporters who he has convinced\nTo demonize end to end to single out the political opponents into regard them as enemies I'm looking at pictures out of Florida where people are showing up at a rounded Sanders rally talking about you know fake news fake bombs\nIf you want to get an indication of how we bizarre our politics has become you mentioned this before but the number of right wing website including people like Rush Limbaugh or basically saying this is not real we shouldn't take it seriously and what that means for our ability to confront the threat\nThat we uh ... that we're facing right now it's a it's an extraordinary time and Donald Trump is a symptom of this but but keep an eye on on the ... influence he is having on people out there and April\n[laughter] I just I could just unbelievable and kind of going back with Joan said I'm this credit card and heat up\nOver the last couple of weeks because the elections that are happening a in a in a few\nDays a week ago [noise] um it doesn't you know he's he's momentum now\nFor his Republicans as the Democratic tidal wave or whatever's nominees supposed to happen or some kind of way but the bottom line is we're actually not that he is out of desperation for winning and as collateral damage\nThan we're seeing it and when do we say when when to stop and this president has got to know you know he may not like that because we report things you don't shape at that we get all sides of the story and and how\nWhat's going on he said it's blue and we feel like aren't going to call it on to get it there but he doesn't like silly\nBut we're faking it now where it's hard to ... it's not okay\nIt is not OK that all that my prayer is that things will change the fact that we continue in in the White House for better day I'm hooked I Believe in this country I Believe it I found it got that believe in freedom of press I Believe in freedom that the soldiers or overseas\nRight said wherever else it makes for a variety so I don't get it from Ryan in I Want to thank\nYou for coming on the show tonight Charlie Sykes thank you very much for being on the program junior staying with us when we return\nIt going to

public radio stations across the country we're asking you tonight what you're telling your kids about our politics have you talked about today's news specifically call us and share your thoughts for for seven four or five\nEight to five five uh actually I was going to introduce the next handler next discussion but I I'm going to go in and take a call and take this call from Sarah in union County Ohio Sarah thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nThanks for taking my call\nSo what are you what do you are you what are you telling your kids about politics for kids about politics\nYeah show um I have four kids between the ages of ... eleven and Nineteen [noise] and\nAnd I also pastor to rural church attack here in union county and I find myself kinda preaching some\nThe puppet and to my kids kind of a lot the same thing on a lot of levels is first of all we have to learn to listen to one another that her we have to learn to not\nVillain I as the other with the problem of a single story because we keep hearing these narrative that this person is this or that person is that ... and everyone's story is so much deeper than that and so when we go to the deaths of experience and we've really left in ... in love and deep reflection\nOn one another were able to understand and ... and maybe can act\nIn a way that quite frankly we've kind of lost track were not able to hear one another and we just\nContinue to become increasingly polarized within families within churches within communities so the importance of listening and waiting before we're speaking sometimes being slow to speak and quick to live here and has never been more important\nWithin ones on political community one political tried\nTo speak to their all my mother works is to have a liberal lecture conservative or conservative lecture a liberal and say you got to do this more of this allows law that only to not only doesn't work it actually makes things worse because people dig in their heels are so\nThis has to come from political leadership but finally in fundamentally were self governing country and we we can come out of this but that requires individual people individually wise to say we want to live lives more of a high politics acquire a home and better deals to the better angels rather than the darker\nImpulse he's a lot of Americans\nAnd Karen I Would love your reaction to everything that you just heard but jumping off what Peter just said in terms of the solution can this can that happen can this change in tone and in an atmosphere that we're in can that happen with out leadership from the president of the United states\nYes\nBut it can happen without leadership and I just want to come back to something you asked which I think is that is very important question which is are we at a tipping point we are\nWe're at a tipping point we don't know which way it's going to tip and we're getting closer and closer and closer to that ledge and you feel it every single day whether it's the reaction to ... whether it's their reactions to Kavanaugh\nWe have a I don't want to blame the Democrats that I Want to call and the Democrats that you basically just say there is a leadership gap from either party the political or the Democrat to somebody to come out and be able to articulate\nFor the nation how to cars I'm a non tribal way forward\nAnd and that's where we stand and and so we are at a tipping point not necessarily a tipping point to that I'd like to say that it could be a tipping point for the better it's just kind of leadership and doesn't have the one person it can be a group of people\nLike it but we need it and we're going to get it\nI'm Glad you said that ... it's not it doesn't have to be one person it can be a group of people and I think a lot of times people are always constantly looking for the one to lead them out when quite frankly they and a bunch of people around them could be the collective one to do it I Want to go to Brian here in Manhattan\nUh Brian thank you very much for calling into America on the line [noise]\nA year or with regard to the mass media and the reason why people do not trust the mass media uh there was little wonderful article that want to show your title on America and you could find it at solar general dot com [noise] I'm Sorry solo journal dot org I'm\nAnd basically
