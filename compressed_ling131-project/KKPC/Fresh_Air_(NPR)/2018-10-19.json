radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday we're here with the latest political news analysis and your calls tonight we have the first the new series that will be bringing you on the ... in the closing days of this campaign field reports from the battleground\nWill be in three key states for updates on the races that will shape our next two years Missouri Nevada and New Jersey but first a quick update on the news of the day\nThis afternoon President Trump acknowledge the Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist Jim ... is likely dead he said the evidence seems indicate that the show he was murdered but stopped short of blaming the Saudi crown prince and he made the comments to the New York times\nAnd they quoted him as saying of Saudi Arabia they've been a good ally and they bought massive amounts of various things and investments in this country which I appreciate and meanwhile let them a potent is weighing in on this says the U.S bears a certain responsibility and he wonders why the Saudis\nHaven't been punished as the Russians were for alleged use of chemical weapons were kind of being fooled by Vladimir Putin's\nAnd tonight ABC News reports are crucial but secretary of state Mike Pompeo was played that tape of ... being murdered and was given a transcript of it by Turkish officials State Department denied that he had heard that tape but did not address whether he had read the transcript of the recording\nAnd meanwhile the Dow Jones falling over three hundred punch today after dropping eight hundred points in a single day last week and if there's an October surprise for voters it just might be what's happening to their four one K. is this month and a Republican Party survey by the polling from public opinion strategies which was leaked to Bloomberg Businessweek\nFinds that the upcoming election is mostly not about the economy jobs trade or any other issue the report says research indicates the determining factor in this election is how voters feel about President Trump\nAnd that's our question for you tonight\nIs your vote whoever you're voting for or against it meant to be a referendum on Donald Trump and\nIs it his policies or his tone is personality that you aren't reacting to so when you go to the polls are you voting for or against Donald Trump even though he's not on the ... give us a call aid for for seven four or five park that's a four four seven four or five eighty two fifty five\nAnd you can also send us a tweet using the hash tag eight oh\nTia okay if you're sort of with our battle ground field reports we have three reporters standing by to update us on the campaigns in their states three fascinating states well here from New Jersey\nWhere there are some races the Democrats hope will be the key to flipping the house then we're going to go to Missouri for an update on the Senate race between democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill\nAnd a Republican challenger Josh Hawley and finally to Nevada where there is a tight Senate race between incumbent Republican Dean Heller\nAnd Democrats Jackie rose and we're going to start with Nancy Solomon managing editor of New Jersey public radio who joins me live in the studio right now so thanks for coming in pre should it become so nearly what is the state of the race in the Garden State lots of bugs the Bob Menendez might be in trouble where are we at tonight\nOkay so let's go back to Alison in Missouri because I was just kind of a bizarre story Missouri as well\nUh this story about a sort of a notorious conservative journalist from the group called project very tough when undercover posing as a volunteer to Claire McCaskill campaign and secretly videotaped her staffers and and here's a clip from project bird\nYeah I think it's like a topic that's not too far to try to get to Mars voters\nBut we're still going to support him or her yeah yeah one or more like no not like\nThey go through other means of support and give them they just don't directly getting the money from their lifetime\nOkay so Allison will give us some context of that video and and how it's playing out in the campaign\n[noise] yes so I'm like you said project very tough went in and um recorded senator McCaskill's campaign staffers um so you know in Missouri where you've got a state that that voted for Trump um but you know you've got a vulnerable Democrat running for reelection\nUm you know the the abortion issue is obviously a touchy\nSubject and so the the video kind of um portrays McCaskill is not being up front about her views on abortion and her views on various gun issues so\nUm you know it's something that I think I'm is going to be a big deal in this race is Senator McCaskill\nUm her office has filed a complaint with ... office ... also the attorney general here in the state so she her campaign of filed a complaint with his office under state law I'm against fraud and deception and nonprofit fundraising so I think they you know they see this as a big deal and and something to\nUm to fight off I mean something to know is that I'm mixed high school supports um banning bump stocks and she support universal background checks and she has a high rating with\nUm emily's list and and Planned Parenthood\nShe's a Democrat in the right so this is in an undercover person to get a tape joined she's a Democrat right okay well let's go back to back to the Nevada um you know I've been a lot of Democrats that a lot of high hopes that this was going to be the pick up see we talked about 'em but I've seen a lot of stories and and the ones that you would address this uh making\nThat that the span of voters do not seem as highly motivated as one would expect in the era of of Trump or so let's let's talk about the role of the Hispanic voters for medical does not turn out in big numbers that is pretty bad news for the Democrats pick up chances isn't it\nIt is that it's definitely bad and and not you know one of the things that we saw happen you know just in general with Democrats turning out in twenty fourteen which was sort of a red wave here in Nevada Republican slept all of the constitutional law that says um you know with the ... through and through Republicans had control both houses of the legislature and a lot of that was\nAttributed of the of the failure of folks that Democrats and the Democratic machine to turn out which like you mentioned including Latino and a lot of that has to do people might hear about you know Harry Reid is that the political godfather of the state and his\nFabled ... machine and that's what gets people to turn out in Nevada is Reid machine order the combination of\nThe state Democratic Party you know at different you know activist groups that that work with the Democratic party and then also the colon area union which is all\nI wanted to talk about that because that that's kind of the wild card in Nevada politics isn't at the corner union\nExactly yeah the ... and it's just a massive mobilizing forth I mean when they show up and get their members to turn out and it can have incredible results for for a Democrat\nOn you know as you can imagine they you know work to bring their at their their members to pulling safe you know they'll they'll buy them over on break um they they do rallies actually and\nJoe Biden will be here over the weekend I was thinking a rally for jacking rather than in other Democrats ethical an air unions though you know a big part of how many people turn out and that's actually how many Latino voter turnout\nDoes have a lot to do with ... the corner union and the rest of the ... machine that they can really get that excitement\nThere to get folks out to the pole in in a midterm\nYear and and and they and they did turn out that was there was one of the states that Hillary Clinton a one or two two years ago let's go to the phones because we we did ask the question are you going to be voting when you go turn on boats are you going to be voting for or against Donald Trump penny let's go to a let's go to a penny from Ewing New Jersey penny thanks for calling into America on the line\nYeah hello hello finish\nYes yes ah your opening question ... I made a special trip I walked to my bully place on primary day to vote against Bob Menendez on the Democratic ... on the Democratic side\nAnd since the ... primary I Am going to hold my nose and I'm voting for a Menendez in ... in the midterm uh like I said\nOkay so the question was what are you voting for Trump to voting form and then there's because of of from\nA ... to to maintain the Senate majority I Am voting against Trump's in terms I Am voting for for the earth for environment for peace and justice\nAnd against the Trump click on TALK or see and the um the holes in that and how old's on legislation and the and the judges and if you've seen this Sherry and that's why I Want to keep Bob Menendez\nIn there at least ... one more Democrats on the Democratic side and not lead to conserve and his ... that has it's such a chokehold on the federal government\nAnd the bureaucracy and stronger so I'm I'm a very pragmatic in the Senate I'm voting for I\nThink maybe for the call and then that's that's what you were describing a little bit before Nancy that that was the go to the real politics that you're seeing from a lot a lot of voters of\nThis is a you know thanks to all three of you for being here in America on long we have to go to a break and when we come back how much money to the Saudis released spend them the United states anyway and what does human ... has to do the voter registration students\n[noise]\n\nThank you to leadership partner the ...

joining me right here in New York capital Rampell\nColumnist on politics and economics for the Washington Post also\nMaria Hinojosa executive director producer and host of Public Radio's Latino USA and from Washington DC political columnist and author\nMotive Sharon her most recent book is sex matters and it does doesn't it more [laughter] I think so either [laughter] um so where where should we begin and we we we have so much you know town you don't want I Want to start with something I'm slowly obsessed about\nI'm a little bit obsessed about a story that I don't think he's getting um is getting as much attention as a law to Steve King Republican congressman from Iowa for reasons best known to him so\nJust decided to endorse a candidate for mayor in Toronto who is I was on a show a little bit earlier this today which is described as a white nationalist which does not really captured\nUm faith goldie is really somebody to flirt with neo Nazis she was fired from her very right wing website job because she insisted on going on the Daily Stormer I mean this is somebody who orders the infamous fourteen words\nIn yet for some reason this doesn't seem to be generating the kind of reaction\nThat you would have I think in other news cycles given Steve kings prominence in in in Republican politics and in in in Congress and I'm certainly not seeing and I I maybe I missed it but I don't see\nComments from other Republicans around the country saying I'm this is beyond the pale so\n... we'll start with you on all of this um you Steve King is and we could go through all the things that that faith goldie stands for but I mean here you have a senior Republican member of Congress who is essentially endorsing a neo Nazi\nKind of horrors that there was a reporter earlier in in the New York times that suggested that the jerk Cushing who obviously is is is very central to the relationship with uh with with the crown prince um which is urging you know people saying this will blow over that that look I'm there they've got other things in the past um middle they bombed\nA busload of children are in in in Yemen and ... blue over so this is going to blow over as as well we talked about this a little bit last night I mean it it is deeply cynical but he's the wrong Mona\n[noise] well this one's a little different I think um we have a great capacity most nations do 'em to ignore the suffering people far away a but this is a lot more personal it's particularly personal for journalists who are keeping this front and center\nUm it was an attack on a person who was a at least a under our jurisdiction and writing for one of our major newspapers um so you know of course of the [laughter]\nThe news cycle being what it is these days you know namely Fifteen minutes long I suppose it's it's possible that in a week it won't seem so urgent but um but I don't think that it will blow over quite so is quite so readily as the bus bombing in Yemen\nOkay Mitch McConnell said yesterday that Republicans had the boats the oldest son\nThey'd go after Obamacare again and they're also saying the social safety net programs are going to have to be cut\nTo help pay for this budget deficit which was partly caused by the tax cut\nAnd I want to ask you about this Kevin ... from my point is an extraordinary story you have a Seventeen percent increase in the federal deficit at a time of incredible prosperity and I guess the question is anyone in Washington actually care about deficit spending anymore\nOnly one Democrat is in the office and then the White House I should say\nUm no they they don't they pretend to but they don't\nAnd look if you look at the long term trends are basically since the post war peace in the in the entire post war period when unemployment has gone down deficits have gone down with the exception of the last few years and during times of war in Vietnam warmer example\nUm we are seeing that in major decoupling of the business cycle\nFrom the deficit and that is because of the Trump tax cuts largely I mean there are other things going on too but the reason why the deficit went up Seventeen percent year over year is not because of our long term entitlement problems even though those do exist that's not what caused the deficits go up last year\nIt's because of these Trump tax cuts as well as spending increases and if Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and all of these other people who have been crying who are clock crying bloody murder when Obama was in office about the fact that the deficit was going up because of the great recession if they actually had principals on this matter they would not have passed\nOn these pieces of legislation that that wide and the deficit and increased\nAre located ... you are probably talk and written about this many times over the last Twenty years\nSay how important it is to bring the deficit down how terrible the national debt would be what a debt crisis would be like\nAnd and have talked to a conservatives who explained over and over and over again the tax cuts pay for themselves that the way to get out of this is to grow the economy to a point where it pays for itself and now we're looking at these numbers which calling to doubt a lot of that and so I guess the question\nHow do you get someone like Paul Ryan whose entire career was warning about the deficit and the debt presiding over this really rather dramatic spike in the deficit\n[noise] you know only um high school sophomore is believe this a fairy tale about tax cuts paying for themselves\nOr that everybody who serious understands that that's ridiculous um and um I Would have to say that among um you know I I agree in part and dissent in part from what Katherine said I mean I I Do agree that the uh\nThe combination of a tax cuts and spending increases under Trump certainly is responsible for the boost in the deficit that we saw this past year but um but over time I think there's no question that the the um entitlement state is the cause of our um as a cause of our long term I'm\nDead and deficits and what I saw what happened [laughter] so yeah what happened to our side no no no what what happens\nGoing forward because the prospect that Republicans will actually ever get around to you're cutting these impediment forever to zero\nHats will never do it Republicans will only cabins right about this will only complain about a justice when when there's a Democrat in the White House\nAnd that means that uh we are on course to have a debt crisis or something along those lines sometime in the not too distant future um we're headed off a cliff as far as our our fiscal I'm\nLimited health agree with that there I I just would like to put a dose of data out there because one of the things that we have seen an increase has been spending in terms of ice immigration detention deportation\nJust so we get a sense where people are deciding in terms of if they're backing these immigration policies to build a wall kind of policies\nMore money is spent on immigration detention and deportation and force meant than all federal law enforcement agencies combined some more than the FBI ATF\nA ... the Justice Department police the kind of money that is being spent now in this ice industrial complex I think might be a place where we think okay well how about cuts here I mean that's pie in the sky but I'm just saying if people buy into these policies [noise]\nThis is at great cost to the American economy\nWe don't have the wall but I'm but I'm not sure that that's going to solve the problem and you know having to get a piece of today where you basically showed the fact that you know you with the economy growing in the deficit growing at the same time which is a nightmare scenario and I don't know where we're going here in the foreign fortunately would have to take a break here and we're gonna be back with his panel\n... we promise we'll take more of your calls in just a moment
