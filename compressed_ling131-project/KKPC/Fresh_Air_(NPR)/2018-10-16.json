Emily ... thanks for joining America on the line tonight\nI think I\nAm or we all know how Trump has said putting denies involvement in the twenty sixteen election as ... as a credible source and maybe it was a four hundred pound hacker sitting on his couch and since that's been affected for him I just listened to the similarities\nWith what he said this morning about the evidence that the Saudi Government had killed your colleague ...\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it\nReally know [noise] maybe\nDon't want to get a day's drive but it sounded to me like maybe there's a big\nWe're going to try getting to the bottom of it\nBut it was a flat denial\nFlattened NATO who knows ambush sound familiar\nYeah you're exactly right it parallels what Trump has been saying for years now at this point on whether Russia meddled in the two dozen sixteen election just Sunday he told CBS is likely style you know Russia they met all I think trying to meddle too\nI'm In in much more domestically we've seen the president give\nMan in his or get accused of behaving badly the benefit of the doubt even when others in his party don't want to stand by that I'm thinking in particular Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race that Republicans walk last year and\nYeah absolutely you jumped on the key point women I\nWant to vote and they lean democratic we already knew that from several they're called that women want to vote or more likely to vote Democrat or Republican by many fourteen percentage point where men tend to lean Republican or Democrat but it's by like a\nFive to six percentage points on and so after\nThe cabin on hearing what this poll is really captured\nIs enthusiasm going up a among independents\nAs well as women toward the Democratic party um and not because you have a majority of Americans not approving of cabin are sitting on the court and the mom majority of Americans it's about fifty percent when you break it out a way from registered voters\nI think that they want cap and not to be investigated by a Democratic Congress which\nThey're willing to vote Democrat in the first place and so I was talking to some operative today are trying to help Democrats keep the Senate or take back the Senate which is going to be a struggle a and they were saying they feel like enthusiasm factors leading their way despite conventional political wisdom\nThat the Senate is pretty much in Republican hands they pointed to the pool and said no I I think we're going to get a lot of our people locked about states like North Dakota Indiana Missouri in West Virginia\nEmily you as a Supreme Court watcher honestly followed the covenant hearings closely what do you think it means of these numbers are accurate we're seeing\nKavanaugh still more unpopular than popular but an indication that Republican turnout might be higher next month as a result of the whole thing plus over some of them are just said\nWhen I'm curious though from you is do you think this says anything larger about the American people's feelings about the me too movement generally we're just about this highly partisan standoff\nWhich this is at more evidence of division rights and the reason it's matters politically is that\nThe Senate is not doesn't reflect majority opinion and a lot of it all over on America and so we're looking at results in particular states mostly red states on where Democrats had an uphill battle and so if Kavanaugh helped Republicans\nBecome more enthusiastic and increases turnout then it could have a disproportionate fact on the composition of the Senate and who wins the house races on the other hand if on you know the vote goes up among Democrats and independents it will matter more there because those are\nRaces where on it's closer and there are there I'm more of a possibility for democratic gains I feel like\nThe political implications are sort of confounding when you're trying to understand the effective cabin on on the whole country and yet always in the United states given our electoral system it's not\nThe national referendum on any particular question that matters that's how it plays out in specific election so I find the whole thing\nNot very satisfying as like a referendum on the need to lose ... because if you were just looking at that you would look at Kavanaugh's approval ratings and say they're down and that's what matters but that's not good how it's going to play out in the election\nNumber briefly any idea if the Senate Democrats are second guessing themselves about how they play the covenant blows it forward situation liquid there so bent on trying to push a confirmation vote passed the midterm elections\nThat they turned off more people to those very Senate candidates trying to win their races to stop Trump from putting more conservatives on the court at the Senate level\nYeah my sense are starting to operatives I'm watching senators since tanks were done is that they felt like they were between a rock and a hard place I mean since Trump nominated cap on July\nSenate Democrats are pressured by their base to do everything they could servers that are getting him on the court with ... Merrick Garland at Republican stole our seat and she doesn't sixteen a ringing in their ears and and they tried that and then these legitimate claims from Christine Blasey Ford came back\nAt the last minute but were introduced into the public sphere in a way that allowed Republicans to claim\nOr to argue that the Democrats were paying playing politics with this even though there was no evidence of that of the uh what I mean by that is a them directly using this accusation to try to take cap and are bringing it out at a particular time um\nAnd at the same time all that was happening you have these red state Democrats like Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly of Indiana Heidi Heitkamp North Dakota staying as far away from this as they could because as you point out that's not something they wanted to ... weeks before the election\nLet me throw in one thing in addition real quick that's kind of related before for sprint I'm Hillary Clinton and an interview stuck to her position the President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky back in the nineties was not abuse of power listen\nDo you think bill should've resigned President Clinton should've resigned in the nineties in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal ... not so it wasn't an abuse of power no\nIn thirty seconds amber does it matter this year what Hillary Clinton says and is there a generational split do you think among women or at least democratic women on this\nI think it doesn't matter because the potential twenty twenty eight presidential candidates like here since ... saying that their party's should've been tougher on Bill Clinton and essentially disagreeing with Hillary Clinton and so I sent were re litigating this all over again even with the Clintons out at the political culture\nUm but in a way that's dividing the Democratic party so I think that does matter it's not something they're going to let go\nNumber Phillips politics because funding for the Washington Post thank you so much for joining us tonight thank you\nTamil rebels alone stays with us as Americans on the line continues [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWe're raising funds here at Colorado Public radio and asking you to add your support with the gift of any amount need a little extra push to take care of that right now\nWhen you can join is a member today you're automatically entered to win a trip for two to one\nWith several nights in the city if you when you have plenty of time to go out on the town [noise] taking the sights Ruben ... troops outside of the city\nOf London trip package has ... other than a nonstop British Airways white on the IRA and seven nights at a forced earn money to\nYou also have mode of transportation\nAnd afford hundred dollar credit on a travel sites ... super troopers word you want to make it\nKind of what your membership you choose the donation among [noise]\nI had to do with them to win a trip to the wonderful French complete rules and ... actually P. R. dot org [noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to America on the line on news and call in show about mid term elections from WNYC in public radio stations across the country Brian Lehrer in for Jonathan tonight\nAnd it's not just candidates on the ballot on election day there are more than a hundred fifty different ballot measures around the country these very so widely from state to state like from voters in Florida deciding whether people who have served their time for crimes can get their right to vote back\nLike they do and many other states to voters in four states deciding whether to cover more working class people under Obama medicated which they're Republican governors have declined to do to a proposal to repeal the sanctuary state law for undocumented immigrants in the progressive state of Oregon\nAnd a proposal to repeal transgender rights in the progressive state of Massachusetts to the ... states of Michigan in North Dakota deciding whether to become\nRecreational marijuana states to Colorado's measure that would repeal believe it or not slavery as a legal form of punishment for certain criminal act that was never taken off the books\nIn the centennial state which by the way is Colorado's nickname because it became a state a hundred years after the declaration of independence centennial state\nSo we'll talk about some of the most important and interesting ones now\nBut here's something else to keep in mind some ballot questions or put there because they helped drive voter turnout in one party or another and that helps their candidates\nLike it was widely believed that George W. Bush won reelection and a very close two thousand four presidential election because Republicans put an anti gay marriage question on the ballot in the ultimate swing states that year of Ohio\nThat drove Republican turnout and Bush won by a hair so ballot questions matter times to Emily Bazelon from the New York times magazine wrote last month about the Florida ex felons question and she is still with us Emily by way of background\nAnd the initiate or of the abolish slavery ballot measure in Colorado thank you so much for some time tonight welcome to America on the line thank you for having me what do you mean slavery is legal form of punishment in Colorado and how is that even a thing on paper and twenty Eighteen\nWell um it's also a legal form of slavery in the nation in the\nUnited States constitution of the thirteenth amendment reads almost exactly the same way that article to section twenty six of the Colorado State constitution reads and that is there some never be in this state either slavery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime where the party should have been duty convicted\nThere was a ballot question and of course there's there's a bit of the constitution that a lot of people don't know unless the person has been duly convicted um there was a ballot question to repeal it in Colorado two years ago I see and it failed what happened\nI'm In twenty sixteen similarly to this year and twenty Eighteen we had the Colorado State legislature both the house\nAnd the ... and ... of voted unanimously to put this before voters um what happened is in the process the wording was\nReal confusing there's this odd sort of double negative wherein people who wanted to actually abolish slavery um we're voting to keep it and uh and vice versa perks weren't freaks weren't sure if they were voting for twenty sixteen and so we've made a huge effort to clear up the language of this year um to make it clear that a yes\nOn amendment a is it yes to abolish slavery\nIs this photo about something that's purely symbolic at this point\nWhen we talk about the constitution um whether that's the national constitution or the state constitution um nothing about that is about\nThe constitution isn't a symbolic document it it loses its the foundation um forum for both our moral in our in our in our legal standing in this country so when you when you start changing the constitution it's\nUh you can't talk about it as being a symbolic move\nI'm Emily ... as a scholar of the Supreme Court you're by extension a scholar of the constitution do you think most Americans would be shocked to learn that slavery is a legitimate form of punishment to this day at least on paper in the United States Constitution\nYeah I mean it's just amazing the things that I mean on the books that we kind of never got around to our racing and I think that says a I'm\nA crazy example of that we obviously don't enforce the law but I understand the motivation to um to officially eliminate it because it just is not how we think about punishment today and certainly not how we should think about it\nUm are there other states a junkie in addition to Colorado where this is still on the books at the state level\nOr there are several um in fact there are it's kind of half and half cross country there are several that still have this wording in their state constitutions and there's several that do not um and yet we all find ways to incarcerate [laughter] I'm just about the same\nRight and and beyond that I gather the kind of work assignments that prisoners can be given while not technically slavery and the traditional sense is an issue by implication and that's an issue in a lot of places right\nSo that's a question we've gotten a lot is that if we take this language of the constitution but we still have the ability\nUm to enforce um community service or work programs things that have proven to reduce recidivism on and the answer is is if we take this language out it'll have no effect on those programs um in many ways was programs are voluntary or folks are compensated for those and they're also clarified statue\nUm and again there are many states in this country or that do not have this language in the constitution at all and still have the ability to enforce um work programs and volunteer and volunteer community service\nSo it sounds like you want to reassure people that prison labor programs can continue exactly um and yet Emily there have been protests that prisons around the country over\nThis issue I don't know if you followed the story at all but raising the question of when is prison labor a form of slavery as opposed to a legitimate form of a forest or as McGee says voluntary\nIn many cases contribution back to society by someone who has who has wrong ditch are you aware of that issue\nAnd then I thought it was really interesting that that contributed to the strike I think if I understand it right what's at issue here it's compensation it's not that I'm a lot of people I'm president don't want to work is that they feel like they're effectively working on us for free and that they're actually in in a way that\nThey don't see the money is going back to the general public they see it as sort of going to feed the president ... complex I think that's their complaints here\nUm one clarification from the earlier issue on the Florida sounds our caller from Pennsylvania\nWho got a felony conviction and couldn't vote 'em we think it's not a lifetime ban right in that Pennsylvania so we didn't want to leave that implication especially for listeners in Pennsylvania who may be in that\nA position of having served time for something and leaving this impression that you can't vote for the rest of your life that's not the case as we just heard Emily confirmed and the Keystone State junkiest repeal of legal slavery gonna win this time we have twenty seconds\nI absolutely I certainly hope so\nYou're supposed to take twenty seconds [laughter] thank you very much we'll be watching on election day another thing listeners for you to follow\nUh on November sex will Colorado repeal the right to punish people with slavery in the state constitutions ... director of campaigns for progress now in the initiate or it'll be abolished slavery ballot
