I mean anything just you know refusing to let me borrow the car that night or something I mean you know I um\nYeah I mean I definitely spent a lot of time being really really angry with both my parents you know with everybody I mean part of that I think was it was just a you know another aspect of or another I'm part of denial or or whatever you know not wanting to take responsibility for my actions and things yeah\n[noise] there were times when you went to rehab willingly and times when you went against your will is that correct yes absolutely did it make a difference to the outcome whether you went there willingly or whether you went there against your will\nUm ... no not really I mean you know each rehab that I went to I feel like really helped me a lot and I learned more and more about myself and I learned more and more about you know this disease and and\nYou know what it takes to stay sober and how to sort of learn how to take care of yourself and love yourself and everything I mean each time that I relapsed after going into treatment I don't think that that meant that those treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I just wasn't ready you know\nThis last treatments that I went to I was absolutely did not want to go you know this is to to a little over two years ago and I was basically coerced into treatment and I you know once I got there I didn't want to stay there\nAnd it's not fun you know what I mean you're being told what to do every second of the day and you know you have to sleep and room with three other people and so it's not like I mean if I could do if I could have done it without having to go to rehab I definitely would have preferred to do that as expensive too you know it's it's it's hard you know for sure\nYou know a lot of people say that if you're in ... you're not gonna\nYou're not really going to be ready\nTo stop until your bottom doubt you seem to hit bottom like a whole bunch of times one of which was when you're on guard so badly infected\nFrom shooting up that um when you went to the when you finally went to the emergency room the doctor thought he might need to amputate your arm somebody would need [laughter] surgeon would need to educate your arm yeah um so how how come incidents like that weren't enough to get you to think well I'd better stop I'm killing myself\nUm well I guess I'm a part of it I again is that I think that killing myself was okay with me you know I mean I I sort of knew that that was what I was doing and and I I was sort of resigned\nTo that and also you know I guess there's a point where you feel like you've gone so far\nDown that building your life back after you know having let everyone down again and having\nYou know disappointed people and and you know overdrawn your bank account and lost her cell phone and lost her job and\nYou know lost her car and I mean it just feels like at certain points I should start over and to try to rebuild my whole life to get it it's just too much and so yeah I might as well just ride this out till the end and just you know see it through until yeah until I'd I'd die you know and [noise]\nBut um but there was I mean there was something inside of me that I guess believed that maybe things can get better somehow even against all you know rationale or whatever\nAnd that little bit of hope you know as well as what I was able to to hold onto and and um you know it's gotten me here thank God so\nWe're listening to an interview with Nick chef and his father David Sheff recorded in two thousand

at Denver centered dot org\nThis is fresh air let's get back to tear each interview with David shift and his son Nick chef and they both written memoirs about coping with Nick's addiction to methamphetamines memoirs which are the basis of the new film beautiful boy starring Steve Carell\nI think one of the things that you both had trouble with\nIn the rehab programs was called God top you know in the ... anonymous model\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were or are still are an an atheist and raised in it without ...\nYou um did\nYou are too high to felt guilty when you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for\nThat too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was I don't know if you think would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time of his ... but that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\n[noise] um but I just I I think that that God thing you know in twelve step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of time and they're trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nCertain that the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthy and sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of a rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... ... everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that but I mean you know that's what he says it but those three months were essential\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of it but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experience some of the traumas that I experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know I've tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power [noise]\nI I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is um it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nIs the rear portion which is associated with pleasure sinking seeking an impulsiveness so it's and control we always think about teenagers being impulsive you know they want to experiment they have all kinds of crazy reckless behavior\nA lot of it is because of that their brain hasn't developed to the point where they can moderate these impulses so it's much more likely that kids are going to use drugs and they're more likely to use them excessively\nSo the development is even slower the part of the brain that normally would regulate it would help kids make better decisions isn't in control so they started using more and there's this cycle\nAnd that's where addiction comes from a Ninety percent of the people who become addicted started using when they were teenagers before they were Eighteen [noise]\nA lot of memoirs written by people who had been addict start within hitting bottom\nYou know the the absolutely worst imagine little thing that happened to them because of their addiction and then they hit bottom and then they go into rehab and they seek treatment and then things start to turn around and in the book kind of begins\nAnd so many stories just like addicts stories that are you know are told you know start again with like hitting bottom and\nI think a lot of people assume that if you love somebody who is addicted to a substance\nThat until they hit bottom and until they really realize that their life is at stake that their dignity is at stake that there's there's no way they're going to give up\nYou know the drug or alcohol and you make a point in the book that that's not necessarily true that if you love somebody who is an addict you don't need to wait until they hit bottom you can intervene and perhaps intervene effectively\nIf you love someone who's an addict and their youth is life threatening you don't wait until they hit bottom because that can mean that they're going to die you have to do everything you can to get them in treatment\nAnd now we know that it's too dangerous to wait for a person to hit bottom I mean people were told that they had to let their kids you know their husbands or wives whoever it was they had to stand back not to intervene let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment center and say please help me\nThat idea it's so dangerous that has killed so many people\nThe other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means that as long as it's not being treated it gets worse addiction as a disease like anything else it's like cancer like heart disease like diabetes and we know\nYou know at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment if someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we would bring them to a doctor to figure out what is going on we would not wait until the disease progressed so we want to intervene in the second we get a sense that there is a problem\nBut you know with addiction and this is different from cancer a person has to\nBe willing to change to stop using\nAnd um I mean you can lock them up in an environment where they can't get drugs you or you know whether that's prison or or you know put them in rehab where there's not going to be any drugs but when they get out you know unless there's constant surveillance they still have to make that decision to\nTo not use 'em\nLet let me give me an example of the story that you've told about your son um when he was addicted that he would call you you know from the street and say you have to pick me up I think I'm dying you have to come get me and take me home and you you didn't want to do that 'cause\nYou've been burned before you take them home and he would he'd steal from you he would do things that would be dangerous for your younger children to observe [noise]\nUm so you finally said to him no I'll pick you up and I'll take you to rehab\nAnd your son said no I don't want to go to rehab doesn't work for me you need to take me home and you said\nCall back when you're ready to go to rehab and you hung up so if you had to do that over again would you think that that was the right way of handling it\nNo I tried though so many times to get him into treatment and I would do anything it took I Would drag him off the streets I searched for him when I could find him you know I I\nI just did whatever it took to get him into treatment and it hadn't worked every time he\nWould go into treatment he would do find for a while and then he would relapse so my assumption was that relapse proved that the treatment hadn't worked but I now know is that many times not always but many times relapse as a part of this disease\nSo addicts get sober a it's a chronic illness the craving doesn't go away unless it's being treated and relapses common\nThat means that even though there was resistance going back into treatment\nEvery time I had to do whatever I cook together into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die so many times I I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive\nBut I finally listen to the messages of these rehab programs that talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone and I kept\nWas artist thing I'd ever done and\nHe did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options that I can think of one has to say well if I'm not driving you'd ...\nI'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home in a while and you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nIn retrospect do you think you should have jobs on the other option is which it would have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but if I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose and died\nIf I got him home at least it would have been off the streets\nAnd I may have been able to get him back in treatment and I would have done everything I could to get him back the way I feel now yeah you want to get your kid off the streets it's too dangerous out there\nWere listening to an interview with journalist David Sheff to re grow spoke with him in two thousand Thirteen
