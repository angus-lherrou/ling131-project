{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "As voter fraud is all too common and then they criticize us for saying that\nAnd we have even Republicans oh that's such a terrible thing to say\n[noise]\nWhen was\nThat Trump bite from\nSo that was a rally back in October twenty sixteen in Colorado Springs and I picked it because it just so happens that our Republican secretary of state when Williams who runs our election system he lives in Colorado Springs and so I asked him if his mission to promote the election system is complicated by President Trump's rhetoric\nYes it causes challenges for me do I wish everybody would say things that were correct all the time yeah they'd make life a whole lot easier\nAnd Williams really sees it as his job to be a cheerleader in this respect to boost confidence in the system\nIf people do not believe the legitimacy of the election results than they denied the legitimacy of the government they refused to pull over for the police officer they\nUm refuse to pay taxes they refused to stop but the red light you know what eh for uh the issue may be and that's not the type of chaos that we want in Colorado or the United states\nAnd I don't think we'll get there I think states like Colorado or showing a way out of that morass or out of that possibility\nIs that working does opening up our electoral system to the public explaining it to journalists like us to that build up trust in democracy\nWell I mean we don't have number specific to Colorado like that poll we mentioned earlier about a third of American voters thinking that foreign governments can change votes [laughter] that was national about\nWhat we do know is that Colorado has great voter turnout more than Seventy percent in twenty sixteen nationwide it was more like fifty eight\nPercent and it's also notable that in our highest profile races you don't see a Jared Pulitzer Walker Stapleton actively undermining our electoral system they're not saying the whole system is rigged like President Trump did in twenty sixteen right exactly but let's let's go back to that guy we met earlier Joshua\nAdams he was downtown I gave him a quick recap of power system works so there's there's a lot of things in place to make sure they are valid is counting correctly that does that make you feel any different\nIt does make me feel different it does make me feel a little bit better\nI think even more so what is now more alarming to me even with that new information is the fact that there's so much misinformation that if a person like myself is completely crazily misinformed then how many other people who are like me are now misinformed\nAnd don't really know what to do how to do anything\n\nAnd Adams says his life is just ... like he works a lot of overtime that he doesn't have time to read the newspaper and educate themselves\nThen it's easier to spread misinformation that people who are desperate and we and that's the problem we're all desperate to just live right now [noise]\nAnd that's the challenge here for\nEvery Joshua there are more people who just don't buy into the system\nI mean is that a problem because it's okay to be skeptical wishing it blindly trust that our elections systems are safe we should demand proof that they are they're\nYeah totally like I agree um experts and election officials also agree they say that Colorado has to keep getting better way to Williams says that and the Democrat running for a seat right now ... while she says that too she wants to try to get more money from the feds to make the systems better\nBut where we are right now in October twenty Eighteen I think we have to acknowledge that Colorado has built a system that seems to be working really well and if you don't believe that election officials here are more than happy to show their work you just have to care enough and have the time to get involved\nBut it does seem like there's two parts to the challenge here again it's it's not just that election officials have to stay one step ahead of the hackers and always be wary of weaknesses in their system they asked to convince the public that their vote will in fact accounts and I guess I'm just not totally sure yet that they've managed to do that\nWell let's take it one step further here because what I keep thinking about is this like right now Colorado is in the enviable position where it's elected officials are reassuring people that they're voted safe\nBut what if our systems work compromise like what if our hackers did get in somehow they'd probably catch it and they fix that but it would probably also do a number and voter confidence and officials then would be trying to rebuild trust and I think that'd be a whole lot harder\n[noise] okay ... thanks so much your August [noise]\nDaniel minor and Sam brash ... to ... the political podcast from CPR news and next time he looks into why people don't vote and how to sway

O T L\nJoining me now in the studio is Julian zealous or professor of history at Princeton University and co author of the upcoming book fault lines a history of the United states since Nineteen Seventy four professor sellers are generally and welcome\nTo American America America on the line thanks for having me here I'm\nActually I'm going to ask you about the the ... to quickly talk about what are the fault lines in uh in America since since Seventy four did they lie on on political issues are cultural issues\nAll of them I mean we have big political fishers which we talk about every day between the two parties where the center has disappeared and where their fundamental differences in terms of what the party's stand for and the kind of politics they practice or social divisions are and even though many people are optimistic about what they see at home or in their community\nOn big questions about gender about race about immigration I think we have a kind of pretty big ah areas of separation that had been growing for decades at this point and that's why they're so hard to resolve\nA and then in the economy we have literal division a of economic wealth and economic well being and that's the problem we've inequality that we talk about what the thinning of the middle class\nAnd the growth of of wealthier Americans and lower class Americans and there's many divisions that are circulating that play into moments like these\nSo on on Saturday President Trump said quote you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past\nCan you talk about it and this was in response to um the murders in in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh and and I'm asking this question because I Want you to talk about anti Semitism in the early twentieth century and white terms like nationalist and native is our dog whistles\nWell it's called people talk about false equivalency that often we say both sides are polarized both but if I Want to be crazy now exactly and it it is a mistake people make and there's many reasons for it\nPart of it as Republicans you know they they come of age in some ways in this era that we're talking about since the seventies so they were much better\nAt creating institutions to nurture\nThe conservative movement they they were very good at creating a conservative media or in the law or the federalist society and other organizations were very sophisticated in ways that liberal didn't quite catch up ah so that's part of it\nI'm only going to uh to\nGabriel who's calling in from Dover New Hampshire Gabriel thank you for calling into America on the line\nThe thank you for taking my call and thank you for having your show uh I just want to share what I'm most pessimistic about the lack of attention to climate change and more and more science I mean that's been evident I think since the seventies and eighties and we\nMostly failed to act on it and what's also now are all in South America and\nI was giving up are treated in the Paris climate accord anybody nuclear treated just like we don't care about\nChinese firms or all of humanity all these other devices issue you know Medicare for all isn't going to help anyone go after the whole planet with off and I don't know where the outrageous and I\nDon't know what's going on with the Republicans ... more facts and science thoughts for decades and she didn't get that money and energy corporations that are just like the only thing I see\nI don't know how we're going to change it or what we're going to do\n... ... ... finish your thought\nOkay I don't\nKnow I don't see anything changing it only seems like we're going to be optimistic directs or maybe some private industry noticing how it's going to be a big money or you're going to cost us a lot for the longer we let it go on nope you make money from now\nWhen we START I think people are realizing you can read plenty with solar and wind um shows are going to need it right some still inside\nGabriel thank you very much for for calling in Gabriel is calling in from from Dover New Hampshire and it made me wonder uh\nHave made me wonder Julian ... is\nIs climate change or or or just ... maybe even if the you know ignorant of factors that one of the fault\nLines in in where we are since Nineteen Seventy four\nI think the environment is becoming a more of a fault line in some ways I think it's the the direction was toward acknowledging misses a real problem we we we we've seen a change in public opinion an understanding that we have to deal with environmental damage\nA climate change acid rain all all kinds of different problems that we face but I Do think now it's actually getting worse a part of it is the mobilization of business against some regulations but part of it is a bigger problem of attacking the very notion of climate change which is actually gaining strength\nI and that's a problem because it's an amorphous issue for many people don't see it you don't know exactly what you're talking about\nAnd if ultimately the science is question if people questioned the very concept the divisions in this society are going to be very great not everyone agrees that it even exists let alone what to do ah so it's going to take a lot of political work to move back to where we were\nA comeback to the issue at hand and then is the um\nThe murder of all those people at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and today at the White House press briefing press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders got pretty emotional or in her opening statement when she spoke about\nThe president I'm being the grandfather of Jewish children his daughter is Jewish by marriage his son in law is Jewish whose parents are the survivors of the Holocaust\n... ... ... this is the disconnect that I have what do you make of how\nSarah Huckabee Sanders and at least initially the president responded to these ... to the to the\nTo the murders and yet he still is out there saying all sorts of things that um you know people\nView as anti Semitic view as in inciting violence ... is there any way to explain that disconnect while the sadness\nHas come into moments not scripted but they were the most contain moments both for Sanders and the president his first appearance is first discussion after that he was back on the campaign trail\nUh he was using that exact same rhetoric mob versus jobs going after the press it didn't really sound that difference so I personally not that convinced\nOr about how moved he's been at least publicly and I think the overwhelming weight of the record in the administration is still his willingness\nTo play around with these elements of the electorate I don't know what he thinks personally but I think his records pretty clear he's been criticized for this over and over again about not being tough on neo Nazis about using language that supremacist like\nAnd once you do it you know\nTen Fifteen twenty times and you have been criticized you have to think there's a conscious willingness to go there for whatever reason and so that's when I see what happened the horrendous events that happened I don't think we can wipe that away and and real quickly\nHow damaging is all of this to the presidency\nVery damaging the president doesn't respond with sorrow NASA moral authority the presidency is weaker than where it was a year or two ago\nProfessor Julian Salazar thank you so much for coming on the show being on America on the line thanks for having a we have to go to a break and when we return more of your

board of blew up lit up\nIt's like a Christmas tree here and so I mean to take a couple of calls before we get to our panel let's go to Susan who's calling in from bath Maine's Susan thank you for calling into America on the line\nThank you for taking my call what are you pessimistic about is\nI Am pessimistic that we are not in gays of national mourning because of what happened at ten o'clock yesterday a\nYou know we we are a country\nThat one way or another we have always felt our human connection to each other and that represents\nA fundamental moral breach in my view it's a fundamental breach of human connection a rather what has happened instead of days of national mourning and I'd give Sarah Huckabee credit for breaking down\nA today um we continue to intellectual ISIS this this is more fodder for\nUh the into little intellectual invasion um the human heart what\nThe human eye sees is a very good\nMoral instructor or in the last segment somebody was talking about how do we get how do we get a grip on global um global warming is a wonderful book based on the human heart called rising by Elizabeth Russia's which states very specifically\nAnd a man who's four of these children are the children of immigrants [noise]\nUm there are a couple of things that professor though is are said in the in the last segment I'm utterly I Would love to get your reaction to and especially given what um you both have been saying oh one is that Republicans will always come home\nAnd the second thing is\nIt's not like President Trump created this moment that were in ... actually we are the ones who created this moment we're in the president is the one who is is desperately exploiting it and I guess my question is a\n... a Charlie is what does it say about who we are as a nation\nAnd who the Republican Party is now under Trump that Republicans are coming home based on a message from the leader of the party that is based in in fear and anger and bigotry [noise]\nWill it says something rather appalling doesn't it um but uh no Julian is absolutely right when he says that the the this this dysfunction these divisions\nAre these dark things in our in our culture were pre existing conditions before Donald Trump came along I think he's he's made it worse um I Do think that this is where moral leadership can come in where you know you could have a leader who appeal to the better angels of our nature he has in fact appeal to the exact opposite\nBut he's also absolutely right that that there's a very cynical calculation\nHere the Republicans will swallow anything\nAnd we're watching him radicalized his supporters that people hope people understand that that by becoming more extreme and behaving more radically he really is testing his supporters and making them by in taking them further and further he is radicalizing the Republican Party which I think there's exposing itself\nAs being essentially without stitched principles otherwise why would it be so willing to follow somebody like a Donald Trump so it's an extraordinary moment and unfortunately we've had one moral test after another which are the party of my former party has failed\nA Christina before you both before you also respond and just wanted to say that the\nUh New York daily news is reporting right now that police are responding to the New York times building in mid town after report of a suspicious packages and nine ... nine one one call that came in ah right at eight o'clock right as we were we were going on the air and so I just wanted to get that out there ...\nI mean that's not surprising I we have to remember also that Trump is not a politician he's a salesman and says he knows how to sell these ideas and a lot of these uh elected officials Republican elected officials are infer opinion for a pound and a lot of ways and so they've ... so many things\nThat they've they've started to cherry pick right well I don't really believe in this part is you know how he frames these things that I I Believe in you know the tax cuts or whatever it may be but now we have to recognize that if you're in with the Trump this isn't a line item veto you are with him full stop\nWhen you go to Michelle who's calling in from Honolulu, Hawaii Michelle thank you for calling into America on the line\nThank you for taking my call um [noise]\nI'm
