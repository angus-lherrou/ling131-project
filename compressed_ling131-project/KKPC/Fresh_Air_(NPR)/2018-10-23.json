nine this evening remember you can listen anytime online at CPR dot org\n...\nFrom WNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line alive political news and\nOh and show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night we're here with news analysis and your calls\nWe want to hear your opinions on the issues that matter most to you know coming up we'll be joined by one of the Democrat's biggest funders Tom's dire his best known these days where his me to impeach organization\nIt's not winning him a lot of popularity contests within the Democratic party in fact party leaders seem to be running the other way\nBut let's start though with the political news of the day and for that we're joined by the Washington bureau chief for her post Amanda Terkel Amanda welcome back to America on the line great to be here so ... as we speak actually the president of the United states president Donald Trump is in Texas\nDoing a rally for a man he used to call lion head but now she calls him this\n\nBeautiful Ted Texas Ted Amanda please explain what's happening here\n[laughter] well Tetris needs to win his election against a very charismatic Beto O'Rourke and Trump is still popular in Texas so he is swallowing has pride he is letting Trump campaigned for him and he is or getting the fact that Trump during the campaign\nUh basically accused a Cruz's father of assassinating JFK\nAnd talked about how ugly cruises wife was I mean it's a little gross that Ted Cruz's willing to just move on and overlook all those really awful personal\nSlights and and you know that Trump bluffs it you know Trump is out there campaigning for people like Cruz who doubted him who didn't like him and now they desperately need him in order to win so basically a Trump is more popular than a lot of Republican lawmakers and they are embracing him\nI remember a man or maybe you were also there in Cleveland in the hall when Ted Cruz spoke at the Republican convention and criticized Donald Trump from the podium and was booed off the stage have my how things have changed in the last two years\n[noise] yeah I Do remember that too I mean there was it was an intense Republican primary and I was also there and I remember the bowling and\nNow you know beautiful tad a Trump I think his approval rating in general is up maybe a he has a four ... ah it's his approval rating four percent more favorable unfavorable and\nYou know cruise is not a great campaign or federal rockets out they're racing record amounts of money getting people in Texas excited getting people around the country excited and in the last debate he went on the offensive against crews\nAnd cruise assertive doing whatever he can and we are seeing some of that is just overlooking everything he ever said about Trump and just for getting it happens\nYou know here's the thing they don't work has raised a ton of money a more money than I think one report said the President Obama raised\nA at all\nAt one point during his presidential runs and as you said he's very charismatic there seemed to be a big wave of enthusiasm for him around the country and then a poll came out about a week ago the shows that they don't work\nThat tried to enter our country every day now the president didn't say terrorists he said middle Easterners but it's the blending of the language fear that sort of adds to the ads for the discomfort or about the way the president is is talking about this issue\nShort there's no question about that and it's not an accident I mean he does this specifically because he knows what that imagery will bring up I mean he is the most bigoted racist president I think that we've had\n'em and he is somebody that um is absolutely willing to use all of that kind of imagery because he knows exactly what it will do\nLook he won the Republican primary hands down on this issue of immigration and it was a big reason why he won the presidency and and the way that he did it was not to\nThrow out there and really talk about commonsense bipartisan solutions no in fact completely the opposite he used to fear and he used it to ... to bring up these these images to frankly his base many of which are white nationalistic\nAnd do not like uh the changes that are going on in this country the demographic changes and President Trump knows that and he's using it to the hits his advantage\nYou know Murray at one of the the the storylines that's been picking up steam lately is the fact that Latino voters voters Latino voter enthusiasm is not nearly as high\nAs people had expected is is this rhetoric and the way the president is talking about immigration in general and the caravan in particular is that what is dampening enthusiasm among Latino voters\nNo I think I think it's the contrary and and I I'm not convinced that that is actually true uh what what is out there is that there is a study that ah that my friend I have to do a lot of guys from the national association of Latino elected officials put out there they're having a week to week tracking poll which is very interesting\nBut what it did was measured the percentage of Latinos who had been contacted by a party or a candidate and it was very high meaning that no party or no candidate had contacted about fifty five percent of Latino voters um as of about two weeks ago but it also measured\nThe intention to vote for Latinos and it was in the mid seventies which is pretty high in the mid term election for Latinos\nSo I think that the the the polls that had been talking about measuring Latino enthusiasm I don't think are right on the mark but I Will say Jonathan we should assume as a party as a Democrat\nWe should assume that those are correct so that we do everything that we can and the next two weeks to make sure\nThat Latinos understand the importance of the selection to mobilize them to energize them to get the mountain votes but I think that this rhetoric actually does a lot to mobilize let the nose because they see it as a personal attack against them whether they're here with documents or not\nAnd they see it as a personal attack against their families and the community\nSo sir Christina the president President Trump is out there talking about immigration but the\nFormer president President Obama is out also on the campaign trail out in Nevada are talking about health care here's what do you have to say I'm today in Las\n... let me say something as the person who actually passed the law\nWas interesting condition for millions of women can do\nBut there\nIs no way for things for existing conditions when anything for both of\nThose are just so Christina I'm\nPeople may clamoring for President Obama he's out on the trail people have been saying that the Democrats have no they have no issues yet\nHealthcare we've talked about on on the show for weeks now health care has been the issue that even Republicans are running on ... ... is what the what President Obama is what he's doing is that going to help is that going to\nWork I I think it really does depend on a on a geographic space I think you know local politics matters I think it also depends on what types of races\nDemocrats are in across the country the problem is the Democrats don't have a consistent message\nSo yes we are talking about health care yes we're saying that Trump is doing at the border and how he talks about immigrants is inappropriate races and Senate phobic you name it I'm yes we're sort of talking about climate change yes we are talking about school and we've got a lot of issues on the table but it hasn't come out is like a coherent\nNarrative that says this is what we're clearly for and this is what we are steadfastly against\nWhat is it is not on the nature of geography I mean it couldn't it be that in Nevada healthcare is the issue in another place yeah ... is an issue\nAnd I think that that's specific this is why we've seen Obama in certain places right because Obama doesn't necessarily need to go to certain places in the south nor do a voters necessarily want to see him in the south or particular states this may be a very targeted effort for him to go there\nBut I think that you know part of the larger problem with the Democrats right now is that\nSo many elected officials are focusing on Trump is the Trump is back but they're not necessarily putting forth a vision healthcare has passed in you know we see the Republicans consistently trying to think\nOf we well we've got less than a a less than a minute we're all coming back in the ... in in the back half of the show will pick up all of these things because I also want to ask all of you why is it that President Trump's approval ratings given everything that's happened\nHas ticked up to forty seven percent in the NBC News Wall Street journal poll they talked about that is it still would have enough of them will talk all about that after we come back on the panel will be back later in the show when we return as promised ... one of the Democratic party's biggest donors here to talk about\nThe chances of the blue waves and it's personal project impeachment you're listening to America on the line [noise]\nActive members to network partners help strengthen Colorado Public radio through charitable giving

CPR dot org along with our free voters guy it's a comprehensive resource to help cast your vote with contents find that you're not an Eighteen voters guy CPR dot org\n[noise] I'm trying to be a party and you're listening to America on the line of political news and call in show from WNYC\nAnd public radio stations around the country\nYou've seen my next guest on television or billboards encouraging Americans to join his effort to impeach President Trump\nTom ... is a Democratic Party donor and founder and leader of me to impeach and wild need to impeach has six million signatures in his report it to be the biggest voter list in politics there are plenty of democratic leaders who wish he would just stop talking about impeachment here's Nancy Pelosi\nSo let's focus that on that would not be my plan\nWould not be a plan to charge them and I had enough to go on my back and he's the president and [noise]\nYou know fine and let us that the again with the information that comes forward and went to a demonstration [noise] to temperament said as nontraditional that that will do the right thing\nAnd then there's former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd if Democrats win the how do you believe that they need a new form of articles I Hope they don't\nI don't think there's a base for doing that right now\nI think we should wait until the report comes out\nThere talking about Utah's dire welcome to America on the line Jonathan thank you for having me by the way I knew that [laughter] and a reminder to listeners we want to know how you feel about candidates who talked about impeaching to president either for or against call us at eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five so yeah they're talking about you know they're saying that this is not a good idea we shouldn't be talking about this and yet there you are there you have been for more than a year now\nJust a little over a year we started October twenty twenty Seventeen\nThat is the point I was trying to make the time that this really worked was with Richard Nixon and when it was a similar situation but what happened was we were in a similar situation to right now\nAnd then there was a smoking gun and the smoking gun was the tapes were turned out the president had been lying the whole time\nAnd then the country as a whole including Republicans\nTurned on that President and decided it was absolutely unacceptable to have him stay in office and as a result not because they had a change of heart themselves but because the American people how to change of heart Republican senators shows\nTo throw him out of office and there was a famous story that two Republican senators Barry Goldwater and Howard Baker went to the White House\nAnd Richard Nixon said to them how many votes do I have in the Senate and Barry Goldwater said you have twenty which obviously isn't nearly enough and I'm not one of them and and the Nixon resigned because he could see the handwriting on the wall\nThe handwriting was from the American people and so when we look forward there are going to continue Jonathan to be events that are going to show that this president is not just lawless and breaks the law every single day and breaks the constitution every single day but did he is really dangerous for the American people\nLet's go to New England and John who's calling from Portsmouth New Hampshire John thank you for calling into America on the line\nSet off I Want to say that uh I I like the president I don't believe it should be impeached at all\nAs far as the commenter saying that he is is that while you know the last president he he did a lot of unconstitutional things with the things he was trying to do and I edited by talking about how\nIt came across party if a company a moral party that wants to pass laws specially sodomy laws like the gay people\nOkay John John had plenty to say I'm ... and ...\nQuite frankly Tom there are a lot of people who agree with a lot of if not all of what John from\nNew Hampshire has to say and in fact that made me remember that the\nLatest NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows the president's approval rating has picked up five points to forty seven percent how'd you get the American people to rally around the cause of impeaching the president when the president right now is seeing a boost in his approval\n... we've always felt that we have a lay down hand on the facts and B that events would Barris out and let me give you an example Jonathan but apparently not is not convincing you but to me is an overwhelmingly important point I'd say two weeks ago\nThe United nations came out and said that unless we get our climate crisis under control within twelve years which is twenty thirty that we will be subject to on imaginable suffering\nAnd the president we are the only country in the world that is not part of the Paris accords on climate because President Trump has tried to get us to withdraw it hasn't been completed but he stated officially that we are withdrawing from that were the only country in the world\nAnd when being and when this report was described to the president he said I have a pretty good feel for science I have no idea what that means as far as I'm concerned means absolutely nothing\nAnd he's continued not just not to take steps to move to clean energy not to take steps to reduce pollution that actually has tried as hard as he could to increase pollution\nAnd to therefore not just risk but to go towards on imaginable suffering for the American people so when you say to me you know we can just wait\nWe have two years actually what all the scientific body of the world told us is we have twelve years to solve the problem not to start solving the problem\nNot to give it the good old college try to solve the problem so when someone says to me let's wait two years I Know that we have twelve years\nTo solve a problem or based on a magical suffering and when the commander in chief says I Want the American people to suffer unimaginably my point would be let's get rid of them as fast as we possibly can here we've got less than\nTwo minutes left and I want to go to Donald in Honolulu, Hawaii Donald thank you for calling into America on the line\nThat you so much for having me go ahead or\nA well I mean I I Would say no I mean I think that the Democrats are really the kind of stop the narrative of of uh we're going to impeach Trump\nOne because uh the problem really isn't Trump I mean the problem is the culture and our country that deeply divided about sort of what's acceptable in terms of values and beliefs and I think impeaching jumped really isn't going to solve that kind of decision\nAnd two I think it feeds Trump's narrative of the Democratic mob and the things that the Democrats are trying to do and not only helps to empower\nOther Republican base and get them energized and so and then three probably it works against democratic kind of already difficult a messaging and the fact that they're messaging is already problematic and sense that they don't have a clear and cohesive message center by throwing that out there it's so extreme that have just serves that kind of model everything out\nAll right down to thank you very much for calling in from from Honolulu into lessen the minute that we have left Tom\nI'm ... yeah that's an interesting point the problem isn't Trump it's the culture or is it both [noise]\nObviously Mr Trump is supported by the Republican Party pretty much\nWithout exception so to say the problem isn't Trump that it's true that he represents the entire Republican Party not all of whom agreed with them to begin with they have now fallen into lock steps behind him which actually unfair to say that somehow they're separate because they're one in the same as\nOurs Tom ... thank you so much time flew thank you very much for being on America on the line when we come back to the panels gonna come back we're gonna talk about this

our news they call in show about the mid term elections\nBack with us now is our panel Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham University Republican strategist Doug Hi from Washington and also in Washington democratic strategist Maria ... will be taking your calls also in this segment specifically\nHere's the question well\nWe have a lot of talk about impeachment for the last what were the last twenty minutes I don't want to ask about that question anymore let's whatever is on your mind that is not impeachment related give us a call eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five what I Do want to uh talk about is to actually go back a and Christina I Want to\nGet your um your thoughts on the immigration discussion that we were having at the beginning of the show to Doug Doug gave his thoughts Maria gave her thoughts but you are listening and a shaking your head and not and I want to know what you were thinking or what you think about all of\nThis I mean I I I Do think that this is part of Trump's greatest hits you know when he has not produced the wall which is the main thing that his supporters in his base want but he can sort of whip out the racist rhetoric whenever necessary and I do think that he will use these visuals to his advantage\nSo many of his supporters have forgotten that they to our children and grandchildren of immigrants they may not necessarily being from\nLatin America they may be from Europe but they've forgotten that they came to this country oftentimes not with matching oftentimes with the country that didn't necessarily want them even though they were from Europe\nI'm thinking of people who were coming from Italy and Ireland and rain aries and all these other places we're now in Germany and Poland all of a sudden now it's time to shut the borders and I do think that Trump will use this visual because unfortunately so many of his supporters don't see families", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city":
