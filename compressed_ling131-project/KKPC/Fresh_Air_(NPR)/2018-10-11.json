going\nCongratulations this is a huge national award from the boys and girls clubs of America I'm I'm curious about your relationship with that organization I think it dates back to when you were six I first joined it what what attracted you\nA watt first one of my ... birthday I'm a school that I was going to how to after school program a partnership with the ... so step numbers from the west coast could walk to school and then while kids back to the boys it goes up every day so my friends and going there on the rest of schools on there so I just figured if I go to try to you\nAnd what kept you going\nOh I'd probably say as a young kid just the the opportunities to have fun there I'm try new things where there is playing sports are doing educational games or just getting to meet new friends or was it was a place that I felt welcome there\nI understand that early on your mom came to pick you up and had a hard time even finding you what were you were you doing\nYeah this is my first day there um she came to pick me up and we're actually paying us backwards as kids dodge ballgame and I was a small person that whether it goes up and my ... birthday [noise] um so I was only ... left in the game\nAnd so I happen to hit the last staff member there to win the game for the case now the kids came running onto the basketball court replaying dos ball and I found out what might have been calling me to the ... for about ten Fifteen minutes to see what the too happy with\nThat [laughter] but it must be very nice day for you I fast forward quite a few years and you won this award largely for setting up a reading program for the younger kids in the club or we heard just a little bit about it in the introduction how did it work\nOut well I actually started 'cause I was in the program highschool so we have to do community service project so I figured what better way than do it and my boys and Girls Club some there every day for me when my friends don't know if you get we found five kids\nWho are really reading at least to do was below the crane grade level on which is kind of surprising to me so we just figured that we're going to go in there we're going to be with them for four hours um every Friday they are going to come to the best students and that did not work so we figured that we had to ask\nThe kids but they need it from us to help them out so whether that included pizza or playing football with they were playing basketball there I was just developing those relationships to get them to want to read with us it was a really worked for\nPizza that sounds like you're bribing them to read I suppose there are worse things yeah bribe kids for a this is called double trouble reading program\nYes did you call a double trouble\nAlso at first it wasn't called double trouble but then when we started playing basketball or football with the kids read read it for one hour and then play and they eat pizza for another hour or so we've got the name from that will shovel\nOkay so the national award makes you the use of the year for the boys and girls clubs of America you get a twenty five thousand dollars scholarship the renewable for four years and I I have to think that this award is based partly on the results of the reading program to to make a difference\nUm I Would like to think so just because all those kids were in the reading program came in reading at a second grade reading level there in the fifth grade and then each one of them improved by one at least one where you live what the end of the six week period\nThough and that scholarship that's going to get you through the su I guess I'm\nGoing to see is he right now it's going to give me to college um debt free\nThanks for being with us Malecon from traveling Malik

O T L\nK joining me to explain what Medicare for all really is and what it isn't is Jonathan Cohn senior correspondent for huff post\nJonathan Cohn thank you for being on America on the line thank you for having me on the show\nSo Johnson the Democrats fail today to pass a bill that would have eliminated with being called short term healthcare plans that don't cover pre existing conditions what are the short term plans and why did Democrats wants to eliminate them\nShow short term plans have been around for a long time and they're kind of an artifact of the old you know the old Arab before we had the Affordable CARE Act\nUm and they were designed as basically a stopgap you know you're between jobs you ... you know you you're you're going to be a couple of months you know between this dish employer an employee or your insurance is going to laugh and you could pay out of pocket for these policies\nAnd they weren't very good right I mean they cover some things and you know maybe it's doctor visits or maybe they didn't and some hospitalization up to a point and they wouldn't and and they were sold like the old policies were right you couldn't get them if you had preexisting conditions and\nAh if you got one of these policies and they discovered that you got sick but you'd actually had it before you bought the policy they wouldn't pay for that either or they charge you more you know for your pre existing condition [noise]\nUm you know a four to ... comes along Obamacare comes along and now everybody a can get a you know it's supposed to be able to get comprehensive real insurance right you know the kind that you know would cover any medical service you might need and you know has a limit on you're out of pocket costs\nAnd uh the Obama administration said okay well you know now that we have this we don't need these short term policies anymore you know and they kind of let them linger but they were really\nCareful to say look they can only last for three months and maybe it was basically they didn't want people buying these policies in part because a lot of people would buy them and not realize they were basically buying like a piece of junk coverage or something close to it [noise]\nWell you know the Trump Administration came in and they want it to repeal the Affordable CARE Act they wanted to get rid of all these regulations that made you know car brands of insurance available to everyone regardless of pre existing condition they couldn't do it right I mean we we all remember last year you know John McCain John McCain with a thumbs down and they failed to pass a law so they've been trying to figure out ways to\n... senior national correspondent for her post thank you very much for being on America on the lives sake you rabidly\nAnd joining me now in the studio or Catherine Rampell Washington Post columnist on politics and economics and also with us Brian Lehrer host of WNYC use the prime Lehrer show and remember we're taking your calls and your thoughts about Medicare\nFor all at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five welcome Catherine fit to be here fried as always thank you for being here identifying so I Want to pick up on the last question\nI asked Jonathan and throw it out to the the two of you and I'll start with you Katherine\nWhy aren't the Republicans talking about the economy and about their tax\nCuts and instead focusing on health care where they are um squishy ground aren't they\nAre yes they are on the ground but they are on much squishy or ground on tax cuts arguably the tax cuts are phenomenally unpopular\nUm they have been basically since they were introduced last year this is something that the donors wanted and maybe some of their base but amongst the general population they are not popular this is a giveaway to\nThe very wealthy to corporations uh there's some tax cuts that went to middle income people lower income people but they're so modest that people haven't really noticed that you know lots of things affect your paycheck from week to week for a month to month\nAnd so the fact that you get to keep a little bit more of your money or because you're a tax rate went down you may not even notice\nSo the tax cuts themselves are not a winning political issue\nA repealing Obamacare also they learned not winning political issue precisely because people finally learn what that meant right they were all on board with repealing Obamacare when they didn't when when the public did not know what was in it but now that they know what's in it including these protections for people with preexisting conditions they want it to stick around\nSo brain is what what the Republicans are doing is this sort of like a latter day three card Monte like they're trying to do the arts wishing ground on the tax cuts they're an squishy ... really squishy ground on health care and yet\nI'm as Jonathan Cohn was just saying I'm In Missouri the Republican Josh Hawley he's running ads touting healthcare\nYeah I mean here's my whopper of choice from the president's USA Today op ed and Jonathan called referred to this to Trump says he kept his promise to keep pre existing coverage even while dismantling Obamacare well today\nThe very same day as the op ed Senate Republicans voted with Trump's support to allow low cost health insurance plans and guess what insurance companies may make them lower cost\nBy not covering pre existing conditions so on protecting preexisting conditions what are you going to believe Trump or your lying eyes\nYou know what I mean that seems to be I'm sort of the the the ... of of the Trump Administration but when you are I mean that's the president's saying if you've got a again I keep bringing up Josh Holly in Missouri because really playing his ad in in the next segment but it's\nI Katherine helped me here because I don't understand how Republicans are able with a straight face run ads touting their support for health care when there is demonstrable proof that they are trying to take people's health care away\nBecause they know that this is an issue that Americans care about ... again I I keep coming back to what was what was in Obamacare what is in Obamacare\nAnd is popular for the most part there were a couple of provisions that were not that was the individual mandate in the employer mandate but everything else all the other key provisions in the law\nIncluding and especially the protections for those with preexisting conditions are quite popular people just didn't know that those things were in the law\nSo Republicans ran against it for many years and one elections by running against it now that people realize that those protections for themselves for their loved ones for their neighbors might disappear Republicans have no choice but to claim that their record as something other than what it is\nAnd it's starting to look to me like Trump is running one kind of campaign and the congressional candidates are running another if they're talking about health care and knock the economy Trump is talking about the economy now he chose to jump in or maybe an advisor\nWrote this Medicare op ed today I don't know out of some you know party organizer strategy but Trump is out there touting the lowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine which is now in fact\nUh he talks about you know low black unemployment Latino unemployment female unemployment I mean he is running on the economy as part of his populist message it's interesting to me if there's a disconnect\nBetween what he's doing it as big rallies and what the actual candidates on the ground who he's trying to support or doing to get elected in ...\nAnd real quickly in the in in thirty seconds the the import of the president taking a whack at the Federal Reserve chair because the stock market dropped eight hundred points today Catherine\nAwful awful ... there there's tons and tons of research suggesting that it it it is critically important to have an independent central bank or not only in the United states around the world because if the central bank is not independent or as its independence is questioned even if it is independent people don't believe it\nAnd you run the risk of people thinking that inflation is going to grow and that there will be pressure on the fed to keep rates low just like Trump wants them to do\nUm and that again people will respond to those expectations and and you can't keep inflation under control this isn't a very bad news for Trump to each other and the fat\nOr we we've got to take a break will probably come back to this at another time when we return more with our panel and more of your calls at ... for for seven four five eight to five five you're listening to

considered every afternoon here the bigger picture from NPR News [noise]\nListen each afternoon for national international in Colorado a news here of Colorado Public radio news [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm trying to think Kay part and you're listening to America on the line from WNYC radio and public radio stations across the country this is a show about politics in the mid term elections and\nNow that election day is twenty seven days away we want to check in on key races here what the candidates are talking about and share some of their notable commercials still with me in Studio to do that or Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show and WNYC\nAnd Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell before we jump into calls and commercial Brian you want it in on what we're talking about in the at the very end of the last segment about the fed and the president attacking the fed\nTo things I think that the tension that's going on in the markets right now shows how the interests of workers in the interest of owners are sometimes at odds and raises the question which one\nIs the government including the said I'm going to favor this happened back in the nineties as well unemployment would go down\nThe fed would raise interest rates so that unemployment didn't go down\nTo quickly uh and spark inflation and progressive set that time what how all at the fed for raising rates because it was like the fed Alan Greenspan in those days wanted enough unemployment why does he want workers to be out of jobs that's not progressive\nAnd if we're looking at Trump now putting pressure politically on the fed is hardly unique I pulled out this article from Nineteen Ninety three justice Bill Clinton was taking office\nFrom the New York times and it's as Mr Clinton and the governors of the fed or on a collision course because of the central bank wants economic growth to continue its slow takeoff\nHoping to keep inflation heading down or the Mr Clinton's advisors have a quite different goal for faster economic growth to fulfill his campaign pledge sound familiar\nYeah but I mean I don't know where we did you say that President Clinton did President Clinton directly attack the fed\nThat's not that I'm aware of I mean I think the Republican plan as far as I can tell it for performing healthcare it's just don't ever get sick you know it's like the richer don't get sick um it's not protections for people with preexisting conditions\nI don't know those particular races to be honest but the whole yeah it sounded like he was on the defensive like Claire McCaskill the Democrat was saying\nHoly would take away your coverage for pre existing conditions and he had to put up an ad that said no I wouldn't well somebody in the Missouri press corps I presume is asking holiday would you vote if you were elected to the Senate for the bill that all the Republican senators its ups is in college\nDid vote for today that would end the guarantee for preexisting conditions in insurance policies and so you could hear at least how he was on the defensive there I'm I'm not sure what to enter Rebecca had in\nMind um he he uh he wrote a book or is a part of I'm Sorry hall Holly my apologies Holly is a part of that lawsuit in Texas are trying to do I'd kill the uh for double care I Want to go to this ad from a leaf flocking who's running for Congress in Michigan\nCongressman bishop smiling at the White House after voting gotten protections for pre existing conditions something inside me from\nRunning for Congress and I approve this message because Mr bishop that's dereliction of duty and it's a fireball events\nNow the tone of the tone in her ad is one of ... I mean it's defiance is anger of the three that we've heard that one to me any way it sounds like it has she has her finger on the poles maybe\nNot just of her her congressional district but of the country when it comes to health care no\nYeah again um these are very popular protections\nAmongst both Democrats and Republicans the Kaiser Family foundation has pulled on this multiple times and to my knowledge every time they have found that a large majority of Republicans believe that these protections for people with preexisting conditions should stay on the books\nAnd I think not only because of a sense of fairness but also because I'm most people\nAre either themselves have some sort of condition that could on ... in in the immediate term or longer term uh affect the cost of their care at some day people are going to get old\nAnd and going to have health problems even if they are young and healthy and uh you know seemingly invincible today and or they have family members who do so this is a very personal issue for a lot of\nPeople I think its successes face in the marketplace\nThe libertarian philosophy that the market is going to take care of all the country's problems I don't think there's a country in the world where the market really takes place of health care\nBecause health care economics are such that if you really need serious health care it's unbelievably expensive and it's going to bankrupt\nIndividuals uh but you know if all of us are only temporarily able bodied and stuff's going to happen to all of us if the Republicans believe and savings up front than they believe in more devastation when you're sick\nI Want to go to that paradise in the Pacific Hawaii and and calling in from Honolulu thank you for calling into America on the line sink\nYou I'm Glad to be here see in Nineteen Seventy four the state of Hawaii he says the law that made it mandatory that no insurance company could see\nCharge anyone more if they had a\nPre existing conditions they also made it so any person who were work\nTwenty hours a week or more was\nCovered by their employer with health insurance the amount of money that was allowed to be detected from their paycheck would know more than ten percent of their ... says most people in Hawaii you have to work two jobs so that meant you had the opportunity to have double\nCoverage what that all men was there was an incredible pool of people in the insurance we had a number of different choices you could have PPO you could have an HMO sailor\nUsually two or three insurance as you could choose from with your company based on the size of your company\nSent meant you had really low health insurance ... everybody was covered and we have one of the healthiest states in the nation Obamacare change some of that\nNot necessarily for the better but I Would like everybody to be able to have with the state of Hawaii made real in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd I want to thank you very much for for calling in from from Honolulu calling into America on the line I mean is that is that the solution just the Hawaii model\n[noise] you know to be honest I don't know much about the Hawaii model but one um [noise] point that I Would just make is that if you require insurance companies to charge everybody the same price\nAt for insurance and ... to cover all sorts of conditions I'm as Obamacare did at the very least you know these essential health benefits\nUm and not turn people away\nFor having a healthcare problems that that can end up itself not necessarily solve the problem because if you don't require people to buy insurance only the people who need insurance by it to help the people don't buy it and then the prices just spiral out of control so I I think you need those protections for people but you also need requirements that people buying insurance\nIs Catherine Rampell Brian Lehrer thanks so much for being here tonight I'm we're going to play that Ted Cruz at one of these days is really funny one that people can talk about it\nTake a short break and when we returned foreign policy is a political issue too isn't it you're listening to America on the line
