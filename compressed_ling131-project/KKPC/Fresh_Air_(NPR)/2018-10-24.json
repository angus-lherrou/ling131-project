C.\nTo federal law enforcement officials tell NPR that the package soon to be Obama's was quote similar in nature to separate packages into the New York homes or former secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nAnd billionaire democratic donor George Soros the Trump Administration has come to terms with its calling it'd be attempted attacks vice president Mike Pence tweeted these cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this country President Trump retweeted it saying quote I agree wholeheartedly exclamation point\nBrakkton Booker NPR News Washington\nSources the officers of also intercepted suspicious packages addressed to Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder in California congresswoman Maxine Waters short time ago President Trump condemned political violence\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nThe critics accuse Trump Castle encouraging aggressive actions by his supporter base such as when he drew last from voters at a campaign rally from Montana congressman Gretchen forte who was charged with attacking a journalist Trump said anyone who can do a body slam was his kind of guy\nTrump seizing on an approaching migrant caravan is a campaign called tighten immigration laws in this country thousands of migrants from Central America and making their way north reporter Emily Green has been traveling with a group and says the migrants are more dispersed than in previous day's unlike in\nPrevious days there was nobody lining the roads giving out snacks and bags of water many of the migrants say they're dehydrated there continues to be relatively heavy police presence tracking the caravan and government helicopters are flying overhead but the Mexican authorities have made no effort to stop its passage\nOh no absolutely well I think in response to your question Robert I Believe first of all I've been a little disappointed to that I have not heard Democrats stand up and say this is bunk I mean these are people who are seeking a better life and very few of them are going to make it through the borders they make it to the border\nAnd we haven't we haven't heard that I think the I I'm not speaking for democratic leaders but I think the reason is\nThat Donald Trump is clearly trying to make this the issue in the campaign he said the campaign is all about the caravan and Kavanaugh and common sense\nAnd I think they see that as a trap they don't want to walk into it because he is trying to make them look like they are for open borders and they're trying to keep the focus on the economy and on health care particularly a and on\nWhat Mitch McConnell talked about last week that if you leave for the Republican to leave the Republicans in power they'll go after Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security I think that's where Democrats would they'd rather focus on that and they don't want to be dragged and that would be carrying for\nI think that add it if if I can that ad but those key points to a Democrats for tax hikes open borders socialized medicine that is a a common a issue or common message that has driven up against many\nA Democrat specifically in the Senate races and there's not a lot of pushback because that is a there's a lot of truth to that in in terms of where the Democrats than but let me just say just one quick thing on on the caravan that this administration\nIssue and I could disagree on that right that's finally they cannot [laughter] but I\nCan learn to raise taxes to pay for education for instance I mean we've been hearing that today but go ahead go\nAhead yeah just a ... on on the care of and that the administration has mentioned this and I think it's a valid point\nDemocrats policies of catch and release and the loop holes with regard to those policies are an incentive for people to come into this country granted a lot of people in the caravan are seeking asylum they are fleeing\nAt a danger in their home country but many of them come to this country because they know once they step one show in America\nThey are the chances of them being sent back home if if there's a request is not granted as minimal and that is a large in large part due to the Democrat catch and release policy once they're here\nThey're here if I may just step up with the fact is Donald Trump has been talking about to board or if you look at the end by the administration's own numbers more people have been coming to the word despite Donald Trump's tough talk uh than than we're a year ago and I want to put the ... in perspective\nJust this is calm down everybody this is the second Caribbean this year the one in April Fifteen hundred people made it\nTo the American border two hundred and fifty applied for asylum of whom three\nThree people were given a silent this is not and the salt on our country\nNear the reading of dwell they'd here in America is worried and we're exporting out that if they were to walk the whole time and not sleep it would still get them more than a month to get to the U.S back to drive from the ... we have just a few seconds left and I want to ask each of you for literally five seconds ooh protection built press for the midterms at this point a couple of weeks at\nA I Would

B. U. R. I'm Jeremy Hobson we're following the news today about a number of suspicious packages intercepted by law enforcement around the country\nIncluding packages addressed to former president Brock Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton CNN's offices in New York City\nAnd now us representative Maxine Waters and former Democratic National Committee chair Deborah Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nHad been added to that list NPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now for an update Hi Phil Hi Jeremy so when you count 'em all up at this point and they seem to be coming out by the hour but there have been at least six packages intercepted\nUh including that package on Monday Night or near the home of the billionaire George Soros who who invest a lot in liberal causes what do we know about\nThese attempted attacks well\nA federal authorities are told our network NPR my colleague Ryan Lucas that at least some of these devices appear to be\nSimilar to each other the ones that went to Obama Clinton and the Soros device you talked about it from earlier this week now we don't know if that means they came from the same person or people but uh what the federal authorities are willing to say that they do see a pattern or similarities between these devices that would appear to fit to fit with this political theme of\nDemocrats or the news media are because CNN was one of these targets but we don't know who's responsible for this and right now we don't know why are all these suspicious packages were sent out\nA President Trump addressed the attempted attack this afternoon at a White House event let's listen\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd many of the people and organizations targeted our political adversaries of Trump's he has had harsh words of course for CNN\nFor Hillary Clinton for ... for Maxine Waters just the other day and a rally that he gave in Texas or he also just recently praised Montana a is a Montana representative ... body slamming a journalist\n... is our people drawing a connection between President Trump's rhetoric and what happened today\nWell political figures including the president have called for passivity for calm they've said they don't want American politics to become about violence or the threat of violence\nSo at least the people in power elected officials are trying to address those concerns and say this should not be the way political life has lived in the United states and that's coming both from Democrats including the New York governor Andrew Cuomo today who's a Democrat and also from big important Republicans like the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell they both said that\nIn terms of federal investigators however we haven't gotten any indication about\nWho is responsible as I mentioned earlier so we right now just don't know whether there was a political motive\nFor someone or some people sending all these suspicious devices and these were sent through the mail or did somebody going drop them off in these places do we know we don't know that we know at least one or two of these devices appears to have arrived by the mail\nCNN you know because it's a news organization at a news organization makes it very convenient to cover these types of things that posted a picture of an envelope and this device that arrived at its officers today\nThere were a number of stamps on the outside of the envelope suggesting that it had come you know through the normal US mail but we don't have an official accounting right now about how each one of the other ones\nMay have arrived at their various targets or whether they were even the targets that were intended whether they might have actually wound up someplace that they know what's supposed to go\nA fast developing story and we will keep on top of it
