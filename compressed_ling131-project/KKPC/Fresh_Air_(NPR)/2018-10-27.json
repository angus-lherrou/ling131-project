Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved and the Nineteen fifties as this kind of [noise]\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we are going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWere mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also a lot of girls at that time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nSee anything he was on a like fluid in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes them as inter and [laughter] it's kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends with gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gave\nHis sexuality was something I think you know as you get used to it you saw what you wanted to see you know and I think Louis kind of hoping to go in wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did one guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when I left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI Am have zero price when I rent a exactly yeah\nYou know and and ah I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you never want to spend money we were living in these all of these small places he would never asked his father for Monday and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said what would your father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money you know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what\nLose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the complexity flu dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing and his father's accounting office yes extending transgression is that [laughter] I Try to let it\nI Know he's ... and he always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time and make money and if they were ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nYou know I'm a part of who he was I mean that kind of anger and desire for control manifested itself and that\nYou know obviously despicable way ah and you know yeah Betty certainly felt or you know there was a um\n[noise] you know\nI don't this is not to justify this there's a song called Caroline says two on Berlin and or the lyrics go Caroline says she gets up off the floor you could hit me all you want to but I Love you anymore\nAnd first of all I mean in four lines that's like a little movie\nAnd it gets that the kind of desperation in hitter you know I think that there was\nA an incredible level of fear of abandonment and\nAnd terror and that's what motivated his violence you know it it was you know no way I mean it was I mean it doesn't matter what the motivations were to a certain extent unless you're trying to understand this person um you know it's it's a heinous act\nBut it it's coming out of a kind of desperation I mean it's less about hostility than ah than it is a ... about a kind of self hatred and and fear\nAnd he's out there like me and drinking and using drugs and who knows how how that's affecting him to certainly I mean every much out of that is not that's not helpful if you have a bad temper and if you have a tendency to be out of control\n[laughter] certainly not yeah certainly not and it was a [noise] you know that was very much part of his life um you know in those days I'm\nOne of his partners for about three years was transferred his um\n... Shaffir yeah yep yep she was\nAnd so they were together for three years and um he dedicated his em Coney Island baby to her her name uh west Rachel I'm what can you tell us about race on her relationship with me very well that's a you know that story\nRight it is extremely complicated subject I'll Try to distill it you know it um [noise]\nYou know he met a Rachel in an after hours bar and just really fell in love with her and this was one of the revelations of the book\nTo me you know I knew about Rachel I mean he wrote about her so uh yeah I was aware that she existed but you know in my mind you know in a casual ... founded our Lou he's wild he'll do anything but in fact you have there was a real depth to that relationship and you know they had\nYou know they live together or they entertain together they went out together it was bowl I mean if uh you know if a if a rock star of loose stature did that now it would be you know regarded shocking\nAnd you know certainly in the seventies you know it was you know just kind of unheard of but um you know there was genuine affection there and also\nRitual is kind of also a kind of road manager for the ... very interesting thing I was a contemporary peace where\nA a writer named Caroline Kuhn a British writer was writing about being with Lou and Rachel and they were kind of arguing like Louis saying what's going on here like you're supposed to take care of me like why am I taking care of you and it was sort of playful and it was a fight and that was also a reality to it you know like\nYou're supposed to be arranging the cars to the venue and you're supposed to be talking about what I Need like yeah well you know\nUh why am I looking after you know you and your problems\nBut Rachel how the secret life you know Rachel was out on the street and would um you know she pulled a knife on the girls who was looking at Lew backstage at the bottom line you know just wander off\nA you know people recall seeing a Rachel I'm you know beaten up not as a result of a relationship would lose seemingly but you know just out of the other kind of\nA situation that you would get involved in and it was\nA you know in that kind of thing I think really has an appeal for Lu the idea that I think anybody who\nDidn't fully um submit to him who didn't fully become part of his world who kept something to themselves or I think that that only kind of enticed his interest and uh you know a\nRachel's life as a hustler was who was something I think that had a real appeal from the\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony to Curtis the author of Lou Reed uh life will be right back this is fresh air\n\n\nSupport comes from the U.S Olympic Training center in Colorado Springs home to Atlantic and Paralympic athletes training for gold tourist Monday through Saturday nine AM to four pm sharp and visitor center opens Sundays eleven AM to five PM team usa dot org\nOh\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes in rates are available on mine learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\nNow that's progressive and from tulip pictures presenting ... inspired by events in Mexico's Bermuda Triangle the zone of silence to save her son's life a woman must find a stone that holds the power to turn back time\nIn select theaters today\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony ...
