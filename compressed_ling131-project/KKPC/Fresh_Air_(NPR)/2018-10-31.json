Bush I remember when I was living here in the wake of the attacks of nine eleven and I remember everyone asking when is the president coming to New York\nTo be with us here and I remember immediately after Charleston everyone kept asking where is President Obama when is he going to go to Charleston or to be a part of the healing process and instead with ... with President Trump has been\nIt has than it than the opposite and it sort of brings in high relieve the fact that a President Trump when it comes to being ... solar in chief\nOr just has not been able to to rise to that level I'm going to talk about a story is very bizarre story um that's hit today\nAnd this [noise] um well let me just read the special counsel Robert Mueller's office has asked the FBI to investigate and alleged scheme involving a sexual harassment claim against Robert Mueller\nAnd it's winter is ban on fire about this 'cause the guy who is making the ... the accusation and it's all sort of\nFalling apart and Mad Max and you know anything about this in ... what he does even such an accusation have hold any water had any merit\nThis is the charge about Robert Mueller yes I mean this this seems to be a bizarre attempts by\nSome right wing figures to discredit the special counsel by somehow supporting a woman to a claim sexual misconduct against them which is ludicrous I mean I think anybody knows Robert Mueller will testify on many out that he is\nThe straight as the straight arrows I mean there's nothing to be found in his closet I mean you've lived a life truly above reproach and so and and these seem like really ... so type\nA tight maneuvers on the part of some of Trump's backers I think\nThe real question that race or there's nothing to do with Robert mode of the question that's raised here is a worthy conspirators who were trying so closely to frame the special counsel did they have any contracts with the White House the Republican officials have any connection with this I think that is something that that needs to be investigated because this is certainly\nA a disturbing attempt to obstruct the special counsel's investigation\nAnd as a brand new when his\nHand was just going to pass along a quote from Peter car\nA Justice Department spokesman who is with the special counsel team he said quote when we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money\nTo make false claims about the special counsel we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation so that was first reported by the Atlantic today\nAnd there it is this is not an investigation of Robert Mueller to be extremely clear this is investigating an investigation of somebody who apparently was trying to pay women to make false claims\nAgainst Robert Mueller to discredit him allegedly\nThis is pretty I mean if you're gonna go for Robert phone [laughter] ... as they while while okay I'm ...\nNow I mean this is right up there I mean this was even more bizarre then Trump claiming that Mueller has a conflict of interest because apparently he quit one of Trump's golf clubs and there is some dispute over the fees or something and so\nYou know Trump is trying to see justice will get Robert Miller a reason to frame the president I mean just so bizarre you know trying to help you and has his integrity which is on a teachable\nI'm In one more one more thing to bring up in a less than two minutes that we have apparently secretary of the interior zinc he\nIs being investigated by the department of justice he has been in the um uh under serious investigation for various lapses are just so I had a time when we're talking about there being no checks and balances on on the president or his administration it does seem as though\nI'm corruption does have its limits within the within the Justice Department are within the Trump Administration now\nYeah I'm not familiar with is in the story very much but I think it has something to do with using his office allegedly potentially for personal profit on the side I'm ... and\nThe only thing I could say as a matter of comment about that is that may be the president and once again sets the tone because he manages to promote his golf courses wherever he goes and hotels and\nI Love the Saudis 'cause they buy ally in apartments so you know maybe think he looks around and says well I guess this is okay these days but I don't really know that that's happening\nAnd max is it possible that ... let's say a week from tonight Democrats do take back the house and get and get all sorts of subpoena power that they will use that power to hold more people within the administration accountable in the way that the O.

question for you do Americans value of democracy less than we used to what a lot of us be okay with a leader who wasn't required to work with Congress\nThe answer is yes according to the world values survey which measures attitudes about democracy and with that in mind that's our question for you tonight how do you feel about democracy is our system of government working for you or could you imagine living\nUnder a different system and authoritarian system military leadership\nCall us at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five that's eight four four seven four or five\nTalk our colleagues at radiolab are doing a special episode on democracy time to election day\nReporter a lot of Nasser joins us from Los Angeles to tell us more about how liberal democracy is regarded by its citizens\nWelcome to hang on the line I thank you very much All right so this this is fascinating and so you're you're ... episode starts off with something called as I mentioned before the world values survey and ... um\nThe let me see where is that first question the first question and the survey is this how do you feel about having a strong ruler who doesn't have to bother with Congress or election what did people say in response to that\nYeah well so so the the the person the researcher who who sort of find as far as a as a political scientist Josh a monk at Harvard and and he was comparing weight that people were answering these questions Americans were answering these questions\nAre back in the nineties and then in the latest version of the survey and so the question or would you say that having a strong leader who does not have to bother with Congress in elections is a good way of governing the country I'm\nUh in Nineteen Ninety five about twenty four percent of Americans endorsed this idea of the strongman leader or in the latest survey thirty two percent that ... that would that's incredible go ahead go ahead yeah which is really ... which is really surprising\nYou think that let's go to San jose in touch in New Jersey ... thank you very much for calling into America on the line\nThank you so much for having me I'm should I go straight into why they go right on in\n[noise] on I\nI think the first of all of the out of this is the most of the nation and on the face of the U.S and I'm grateful for having a mock sketch they may not be the thing is\nI think me leaving I Am all courtesy and what I mean by that is\nSo let's see if we can find the school system you know ... when I sit there including the only ... ... it's far from there to fight that you know there is no place for an independent unless you are about ...\nSon Jay thank you very much for for calling into America on the\nLine and he raises that was actually I I'm an interesting point in that he's in San Jay said that we are living under the illusion\nOf democracy or we have this two party system that we have this two party system that is that the exclusion\nOf third of third parties is that um lettuce is is that what could\nBe driving down sort of support for democracy that democracy seems to be democracy not really for everybody\nI mean certainly that's a huge part of that that feeling that you're ... jacket it into this two party system and you when you do ... you know drag yourself out to the polls you have to kind of plug your nose while you while you stop your your ballot in the box\nUm and I think that for us like a you know that that feeling in general that people feel like they're not being\nHeard or represented that they're being forced to uh yeah that the system kind of has a has has narrowed their options and that uh it yet isn't isn't actually representing them um that's that's certainly a part of it and that was yeah one of the things that that we got so fascinated in this up for this episode\nWe're working on a lot of one of the one of the I guess proposed solutions 'em to all of this to sort of break the I'm sort of jaundiced view of democracy is something called the rank choice voting\nAnd I want you to talk about that in in if you could because as I was reading about it I kept thinking for those of us of a certain age you might remember Lani Guinier\nWho was President Clinton's nominee for the civil rights division at the Justice Department and her nomination got Scott all the because she had written in favor of something called cumulative voting rights are they are they the same or they they're they're a little bit different there are a little bit\nDifferent but aren't regulated showed up rank choice yeah but but they're they're somewhat similar but but let me tell you about rank choice oh so rain choice is actually a it it sounds complicated but it's not so complicated it's pretty similar to what we already out so you go into the voting booth you get your ballot has a slate of candidates on it\nYou you pick you know your candidate to vote for as your top choice so so far so normal but and then here's where the rain choice part comes and you can also say if you want you know oh by the way this other person is my second choice and and then yet another person is my third choice and here's my fourth and fifth and you can kind of list as many candidates as you wish or is there are\nUm so basically you're just you're you're drinking a ... as many of the candidates as you want you're saying this is the you know gold silver and bronze medal of my boat\nUm [noise] so that's kind of from the voters for second from from accounting side the way that it works is that in order to win a candidate you know maybe obviously need a majority of the vote so so so you start with all the first choices getting tallied up if one candidate has\nFifty percent plus one a first choice votes here she wins no problem but it's not the bottom vote getter is eliminated\nAnd then that person's votes instead of sort of dying with the candidate that person's votes are sort of born again as their second choice so those go into the column of whoever's the number two on that particular ballot\nAnd and when you do that or you take a look okay does now does anyone have majority of the vote and basically you just keep you know lather in rinsing and repeating until you have someone who\nWho is the winner is this is this actually in operation anywhere here in the country yeah\nThis is happening on a city level in a whole bunch of places like Minneapolis San Francisco Oakland a bunch of places but the really exciting thing is it's about to happen in a in Maine for the first time not on a city level\nBut for um for you know national level candidates for the one Senate seat and the two house seats that are going to be decided next week in Maine\nWas this something that was it implemented by the state legislature and signed into law by the governor was this a ballot initiative\nSo actually it was kind of a it was kind of despite the legislature and governor that the people voted it in a ... they've been fighting the miners had been fighting for for a while and then they approved it in a referendum the state legislature sort of bulk and tried to postpone it\nAnd push it off by five years and then the voters they had this thing called the the people's veto they just voted for it again and so now they're going for it to now they're doing it and it's a it's a really exciting because it's the first time that this\nSystem is being used for for a national level race or so it's kind of a kind of a great experiment and we'll see what happens next week\nWrite in exactly seven days a lot of

incredible person that they are I I\nGet how you could see that the but there and I want to ask you about that at the same time in the context of everything that President Trump is said calling people animals or you know ... making comments that are that are in in my view I mean I don't know about what do you think\nIt's a I think senator dial it was a little tone deaf with his language and he should be admonished for that\nAt the same time the point of his statement was to give credit an honor to the people who are who he was working with the point of Donald Trump's statements when he talks about the the caravan coming up from the south and sending five thousand troops to the border for something that's not even a crisis\nOr to to do that the point is just a fear in the American public and frankly to stoke racial animus and that is the thing that we cannot ignore so I don't get I don't say Donald Trump is responsible for the attack of a synagogue or for the pipe bombs\nBut now he knows what will car in ... when he when he sets the tone that he sets everything he has done since then we'll be his responsibility because he knows what can happen with the words than where

it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them to fall for nine seconds rather than aid in order to help make some of the major themes in the essay work\nJohn changing details about stuff like Tabasco sauce bottles and thermometers is one thing but it seems that Ted unethical to fiddle with details that relate directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical

analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures high ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are and I do not just because one state the ... does not have the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting
