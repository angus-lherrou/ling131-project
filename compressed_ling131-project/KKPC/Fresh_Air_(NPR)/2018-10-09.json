Anderson is a Republican pollster and author of the selfie vote where millennials are leading America and how Republicans can keep up\n[laughter] well [laughter] ah\nStarted so how is this ... let me let me narrow the focus here I'm In the mid term elections and also think about this uh from your vantage point person in this in this midterm election and certainly in twenty twenty easy it's vital for Democrats\nTo go at these races fighting [noise]\nYes and I ... and ... and then you know that I Am a firm believer that you have to do both though I think on the one hand particularly in this cycle and I was communications director of the DNC and the two thousand six cycle which was the last time we\nWe actually had a big victory on the Democratic side and I think you have to have to sort of\nIf you will prosecuted critique about what is happening in the country\nUm that is a ride or a stray from where it should be so in this instance and as we've seen in the past you know it is a culture of corruption the way that the president\nPresident Trump tends to use the administration and the levers of government kind of as his own some would say criminal enterprise I say for you know it's the party of me I think is or it's you know it's about me\nBut just in the I think Colin Powell said a ... somewhat recently instead of being about the country\nUm but then at the same time you have to be able to have a critique because particularly at this moment Republicans controlled everything right so House Senate now the Supreme Court they have a conservative majority as well as the White House\nSo at the same time if you're a democratic if you're a challenger or if your income then you've got to have an argument that says and here's what we would do differently and I and I do think that is something that democratic candidates I've done a good job of\nYou know they ... they were for the people and what they talk about is you know let's let's do things let's get that infrastructure build done and create jobs and talk about raising wages and how do we bring down health care costs\nAre and and instead of having you know ... Republican members of Congress spend their time protecting President Trump from various investigations let's get back to the work of the Congress and the job that we're supposed to do so I really believe you have to have\nBoth so Chris and given ... just said I'm just wondering um you know she argues that Democrats need to say here's what we will do differently will that work\nIn a midterm uh mid term election campaign that is defined by rage as defined by the the president's outspokenness by the Senate majority leader outspokenness\n[noise] I think there are the basis of both parties are quite frustrated and angry right now\nBut I Do think there are voters in the middle who are not necessarily full of rage and anger but instead\nThey feel like things are going okay in terms of the economy but they feel like we can't go on like this in terms of art than national tenor of our discussion so it's not that they themselves feel rage but more concerning and anxiety that\nIt just feels like this can't be right this can't be how our country is going to function from here on out\nSo we don't necessarily know that at least those voters in in the broad middle are looking\nTo sort of have their rage buttons pushed I think what they're looking for is for someone to present a way forward for the country that that seems both ah that that has to be bold um I think you know you have to you have to paint with bold colors not pastels in this case you know but I I think simply being\nYou know trying to out Trump Trump\n... dangerous path for for Democrats to try to take at least maybe one that is quite appealing you know you see for instance I I Believe there is a Twitter exchange between Michael ... and Cory Booker recently the kind of spoke to this debate where I think Michael ... to use the hashtag fight fire with fire is something to that effect\nI mean that may well get a lot of applause lines and a lot of engagement and a lot of you know clips on social media that go viral\nUm but I still not confident that you know when I go to focus groups and talk to swing voters that they're looking to turn up the temperature um I think they're looking for for someone who will be passionate about the country the passionate about what they believe in isn't someone who's going to be making mild\nBut can ring a bell what feels like an end to this moment that swing voters where they sort of say a pox on both your houses to parties\nCan I just add to that John Ritter quickly so because you know I'm seeing the same things in focus groups as well and when I say that people you know you want to make your case about\nYou know what's wrong I'm not suggesting uh actually that it's about rage I think it's about\nMaking an argument that says and here's why we need to a lot more Democrats if you're a Democrat right this is why you need to elect me and I think one of the the most important things that we're seeing from voters as they want to know how will my life be different because I think people are really exhausted\nBy President Trump and that sort of uncertainty that has the tone and tenor has created and so they're still ready to hear more about\nThemselves and how are you going to help make my life better that's what I let you for that's what I send you to Congress for\nAnd I agree absolutely with Christian that people are actually looking not wanting to see the bombastic rhetoric and I and there aren't many candidates that I can think of who are campaigning that way I'm Mr Robin ... maybe you know doing that from the outside but that's different than if you're out there on the trail and\nSay well we're going to be talking about more than ... I use the word rage where do we talk more about that in the next block and was talking to ... and Cory Booker and we're going to be joined by Jill Smith\nA who's going to join us from Miami to talk about Florida politics and more from you on the question was do you want in a candidate someone who fight hard and take the prisoners or someone who was fires and tries to unite us\nOr can you be boats according to Christian and care and you can but what do you think call us at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five you're listening to America on the line\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nSupport for Colorado Public radio comes from Rocky mountain cancer centers offering results driven cancer care using radiation therapy and access to clinical trials more at Rocky Mountain cancer centers dot com\nThe possibility of freezing temperatures overnight for parts of the front range\nThere is a freeze watch in effect through tomorrow morning for Colorado Springs and for Denver this is CPR news tonight lows will be around thirty four Denver and Colorado Springs with a chance of rain or snow showers\nThe chance of rain or snow showers into tomorrow and I will be around forty degrees\nColorado Public radio is exploring more ways to help Heller on from there [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm Daniel ...

I'm Kristin ... into this the the women's raised the anger of women in around the country over what happened\nTo Dr Christine Blasey Ford in this confirmation process the response of now justice\nBrett Kavanaugh if you listen to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or even the president the the rage that is being expressed felt and expressed by women is immaterial if not ignored\nMhm well the thing is you're you have to understand that\nUm to share her story and share her pain and wasn't believe that here's a woman calling in who says that she's tired of the media\nSpeaking for her and she's saying she's saying she's taking the ... the president's line that you know young men are are the victims here Christian is this\n... is this a real a real thing out there um that we should actually pay more attention to take in take seriously as a\nA line of thought that has a lot more a has a lot more adherence to it than we're willing to admit among women\nSure it wasn't just this weekend I was actually looking at as one as you do looking back through all the research studies and one from a earlier this year I tried to understand people's attitudes on\nAn accusations of sexual assault sexual harassment and they asked people how big of a problem do you think you know a variety of things are in in society today and they said how big of a problem do you think it is that women are not believe\nAn eighty percent of Americans said they think the problem that women are not believed um there was a gender gap on how intense of other feeling that list for women that was it was more this is a major problem versus a minor problem but he presented as a problem that women\nAre are are dismissed too often however at the same time Seventy six percent said they think it's a problem\nThat some women may make false claims that the idea that you one hundred percent believe all women may go too far that that you instead you should take all the women seriously and that that may be a safer standard\nOn that takes women's claims very seriously that make sure that makes sure they heard but doesn't completely dismiss\nEven the small possibility of falls planes or miss remembered claims that sort of where the the polling data\nComes down on on where voter sit and one of their number they think it's valuable to point out to Quinnipiac University polling around the cabin case specifically has tended to show you know more opposition than support for Kavanaugh more said they believed Dr Ford than than judge Kavanaugh and their accounts of of what happened\nBut nonetheless about half of the respondents in the polls still said that they felt judge Kavanaugh was treated unfairly in the process and and so you know I think that is that is something that is fairly widespread even if you think on balance\nA Dr Ford you know something horrible happened to her she should've been believe maybe you didn't want to have not to be confirmed this idea that the process we just witness\nWas not one that was well structure to get at the truth and was unfair to everyone involved easy it's fairly a somewhat widespread belief\nSo the question for listeners was I'm back to the original question what do you want in a in a candidate someone who fights hard and take no prisoners with someone who inspires and tries to unite us in the less than five minutes that we have left I Want to go to Donna in Everett, Washington Donald thank you for calling into America on the line [noise]\nDonna\nOkay well I Know there you are\nI worked for very ...
