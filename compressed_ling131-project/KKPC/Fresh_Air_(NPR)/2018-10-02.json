I'm not getting involved in politics you judge a justice Elena Kagan\nSaying quote we should be aware of the environment and not unnecessarily exacerbate the divisions that unfortunately exist now she said this on September twelfth before the cabin on proceedings went into full blown chaos mode but on a personal level\nHow are the justices responding to their branch being at the center of such a painful fight\n[noise] well you know they ah they take I think all of them take very seriously whether they usually the institutional credibility of the court it's it's well ... law schools they all know him very well that the\nThere would seem to be broad consensus on the court in favor of the employees against the uh small a fire department that had fired so a to a fire fighters or the older two oldest firefighters on whether or not they were covered by this federal law so you know that's a reminder that\nYou know a fair number of cases forty percent maybe more are near unanimous or unanimous on the court and there's only a relative minority that divide along this uh for four or five for ideological split just raven Supreme Court correspondent\nFor the wall Street Journal thank you for being on America on the line thanks for having me so when the show started I I I throughout a question\nWhat can we regular every day ... day folks do to calm things down and I wanted to hear how how you're dealing with the situation in your own family the number is eight four four and seven four or five eight to five five and Dennis in union county New Jersey\nIn dentist thank you for calling into America on the line\nClose Jonathan Hi so how are you dealing with it\nBut I I actually don't know if I Am I don't I told the screener that uh I'm a union to destruction worker or younger guy living at home\nAnd my dad was actually a union while there for Thirty years\nAnd as he's gotten older and headed towards retirement I've just seen in sort of fall pretty a propaganda ... this information of the conservative media and it's really confused me I mean\nI told your screener my dad was Woodstock he didn't go to Vietnam but during the twenty sixteen election cycle we had a veterans for Trump signed hanging her garage wow so it's been really difficult especially as I've become more active in my union politically are going to labor marches going zero\nCanvassing events where were you know putting out democratic candidates who have been pro labor\nRight I think it's really difficult right now is so what does your dad said how when you ask how do you go from Woodstock to Trump [noise]\nA lot of it seems like he's fallen for the phobia fear mongering that's the biggest one ... um he it seems like the dog whistles and\nRacial divide there are there's a fear that spin implants it hit in him that I don't see on a person to person basis when you know he's interacting with someone with a different race I can tell you\nMy best friend in the world is half white half black and he's done things for my best friend's family I'm On both sides you know fixing cars driving his eighty five year old African American grandfather to go get his medicine at the pharmacy\nBut at the same time he'll talk about ... New Jersey is ... ... and it it really confuses me when I see his\nPersonal ... system but yet this still exist in fear of the other and we had a lot of big conversations that sometimes turn it into screaming matches and sometimes\nYou know resolved with a ... but it's it's really difficult because our views are\nGrowing further apart Dennis I Want to thank you very much for for calling in the most important thing you said in in your response was that your you and your dad are still talking so keep that conversation going thank you very much Dennis\n... I Want to go to Ian ... we've got a little time in in Honolulu thank you for calling into America on the line\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call sort of one thing I learned from the last several years has that trying you know\nConvince people who\nAlready are sort of think differently than you is a sort of ignore fake news or ignore\nThat potentially you know bogus information or the airlines or hate mongering information is not very useful because they already suspect that your\nPart of the group that they disliked but what I have found is that at the regrets of that there's a lot of people in my own you know sort of ideological circles why we're becoming sort of more of a mirror image of\nWhat we don't like what we said we don't like on the right until I found it more useful actually took call out people with in my own grew up for when they have badly I think that is maybe one of the most important thing we can\nDo is to not let our our own fans are our own circle of of of folks you know get a so tribal I'm so focused on a destroying the other side that we we start perpetuating our own fake news our own\nInformation on how does how does that go over when you call loud yeah when you call out your\nProgress in friends for some of the things that they said that go over the line ...\n... ... it it it usually goes pretty well and and the reason I I think it does is because um when you when you\nFirst of all when you speak with someone with whom we share a goal you know whether on the election or policy or something like that\nThen they're much less likely to view you ... and they know you they're much less likely to view as as a as a you know a an enemy or a threat though I think they take the criticism or so for instance in the cabinet nomination you know there was a lot of\nDiscussion up I'm basically pointing out that all the Republican you know a rich old white guys they're all\n... country caught background people just like Kavanaugh they all just while that give them a path and I just think from the top of my head that you know Ben south I think as the son of a public school teacher and general lake he went on a mission trip to Africa and working with Chris Coons flake and crews are the ones we remove we all have\nThe right and the idea that the al ... and ... out in\n... I got a I have to cut you off because we're going to have to go to a break but yes Chris ... senators Coons and flake had been doing the buddy tour and they were on sixty minutes over the weekend\nOr when we come back you know the panel that's been\nWaiting was supposed to bring them in in a block but we took the calls are going to bring them back in the ... going to continue this conversation about the Supreme Court and how the quest\nWe're going to be talking about it has the Supreme Court ever seen this kind of political divide or are we in uncharted waters\n\n\n\n\nThere is a chance of

most of us can probably agree on is that last Thursday the Senate Judiciary committee hearing and which Dr Christine Blasey Ford and judge Brett Kavanaugh testified\nWas an emotional deeply disturbing display and judge Kavanaugh's tone was a far cry from his last appearance before the committee this statement in particular gave many people pause\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hair\nFuels with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that it's been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nCompare that to how judge Kavanaugh described the correct judicial temperament in twenty Fifteen at Catholic university\nTo be a good judge in a good umpire it's important to have the proper demeanor really important I said to walk and the others choose whether it be the other litigants eye of the lead against in the case the other judges to understand them to keep our emotions in check\nTo be calm admits the storm on the bench to to put it in the vernacular don't be a jerk I think that's important\n[noise] so I wanted to play those two clips because I just want to know if if\nIf this is a new normal for the for the Supreme Court and have we ever seen the Supreme Court so politicized before and I'm gonna bring in a in a presidential historian U.S Supreme court historian a little bit later in this segment but I wanted to bring in my panel now\nTo talk this through and joining me in the studio is WNYC is Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show in Los Angeles Rolling Stone senior writer Tamil Smith\nTo what happened on Thursday of this past week um but but even Judge Thomas at the time while he was angry and better and you could hear the emotion in his voice he didn't burst into tears and he he didn't\nMake the kinds of of just overt political and partisan statements or the judge Kavanaugh did on Thursday so much the way I'm describing it as a judge Kavanaugh went down the Trump being road he added the kinds of emotions\nThat Trump brings to the political stains and he added the partisanship and the kinds of divisions that Trump has made the new normal in American politics and now in Supreme Court nomination politic\nUniverse for and I'm Glad you brought that up because as I was listening to judge Kavanaugh's forty five minute I'm opening statement there last Thursday I kept thinking that this was not for the American people this was not really committed this was for and the\nThis was an audience of one reach an audience of one opening statements\n... ... ... what impact do you think that will have going forward whether he is confirmed or not\nOn judicial record nominees would also on the court\nI think it was as you say an audience of one for certainly the president tried to maintain his support for himself judge Kavanaugh that is but also the audience of Trump supporters the concert referrals to beer and and liking beer a seemed to be going for that Trump being base\nSo to your point what happens if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate and put on the Supreme Court I think it's going to be hard for people to see him in that neutral arbiter role that I thought that now chief justice John Roberts described so eloquently\nPeople can disagree if they wish about the analogy of a Supreme Court justice being the umpire and calling the balls and the strikes but that is the uh the height of that sort of the platonic guardian view that we have a Supreme Court justices they're supposed to be again above the\nFray and they're only human but I once interviewed a Justice O'Connor and I asked her about being a woman and how that had an impact on certainly her appointment and maybe after and she said you know we're all the sum total of our experiences but when I Walk through the door of this court every day I Try to leave that behind\nAnd I think she really did try to do that and I think most of the justices have done that and that's why the court\nHas these very high approval rating certainly compared to the other two branches over the last fifty years\nProfessor I I'm just wondering Kim people given the the overtly person statement statements made by judge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed to to the Supreme Court um\nSee if you do it becomes the ninth justice and you'll litigants go before the court and he's there can people demand that he recused himself from there and demand it but it's\nUp to the judges and justices themselves to to recuse so it wouldn't it wouldn't help for someone to make that argument they can make it but if he doesn't choose to do so he doesn't choose to do so you might recall some of the controversy about\nA Justice Scalia in his friendship with vice president Cheney and whether or not he should recused so\nIt's up it's left up to the judges and justices at the\nFederal level to do that but I think that's where it will be hard for people to give Kavanaugh fair shake in the sense of looking back at what happened on Thursday and saying can he really step back now and be that the objective arbiter calling the balls and strikes without any partisanship or favor\nIn a little bit of time we have left I Want to ask you a process question here because we were longest time you needed a Supreme Court nominee needed to have a super majority of the Senate sixty votes\nTo be confirmed and now all the attention is now focused on depending on the Sims is calling Murkowski mentioned in West Virginia now you only need a simple majority of the Senate to confirm Supreme Court justice how did that happen\nRight well you might recall that that's been a tussle between the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate and the filibuster went away I'm under the Democrats for the lower federal courts the district courts in the courts of appeals\nAnd the Republicans got The Revenge by saying okay we're staying at a four Supreme Court nominees\nI'm sure now the Democrats are rude that day um that they went down this road\nBut recall that back in Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine and justice for his was nominated and promoted up to achieve for attempted to do so by Lyndon Johnson he was filibustered to death he did not get through and get that promotion to chief because he was filibustered by conservative Democrats in the south and\nAnd conservative Republican so back in the day filibusters could prevent someone from going on the court\nA real quickly you I'm recently quoted you recorded and peace in the uh about Trump's re election strategy but might hinge on the Democrats taking either the house and Senate or both if Democrats do have their blue wave how would that set up a Trump presidency in twenty twenty\nRight so my point there was presuming there is not in a successful at ... impeachment if if the Democrats would take back both houses present and there's not an impeachment and a successful conviction and the Senate right that would be awfully hard because it's hard to\nSay that the Democrats would get the super majority still needed by the way for the impeachment to to come to a conviction um my my point was actually to go back to Harry Truman looking at history and and say you know give them hell Donny Truman last uh in the midterms he lost the Senate\nToo and the house Republicans buddy gave him hell and he came back and had that improbable when a Nineteen forty eight\nSo if history is any kind of predict or could be the case for Trump should he run in and twenty twenty ...\nPerry director for the presidential studies at the Miller center at the University of Virginia thank you very much for being on America on the line ...
