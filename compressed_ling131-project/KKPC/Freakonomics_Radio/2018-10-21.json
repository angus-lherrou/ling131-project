Rated movie theater and now it's the front page of a newspaper\nAnd all those things the same time it's all those things at the same time in in what we hear the users are demanding of them is that the creator set of policies that are just\nIn the reality is justice means a very different thing in each one of these settings\nJustice would mean that the person in Mexico gets told the truth in Mexico by Facebook and the little boy in England and doesn't have to look at something gory and horrible in England but you can't put them together because they clash exactly so how do you solve that\nI don't know I I think it's important to keep in mind that even if you have\nThe perfect set of policies that that somehow managed to be just in different settings and that can be consistently enforced\nThe people at the end of the day making these decisions they're still\nAh there's still people they're still human being is this working or no they can hear you yeah\nI spoke to one woman who did this work for Facebook I wanted to be\nA non you must will\nCall her Marie she's from the Philippines where she grew up on a coffee farm\nYeah that's my father is a girl\nShe said many afternoons well she was growing up she and her mother would sit together like outside tuning into their short wave radio\nThey're listening to the voice of America\nOngoing drive by the press\nMeaning agree him one of the great invention is\nOften we find the job [noise] but then [noise]\nSat forward fifty years to twenty ten and Marie is consuming a very different sort of American media\nThere were times when I felt really bad that I Am a Christian and then I looked into this things\nShe became a content moderator back in twenty ten and she and the other moderators on her team who lived throughout the Philippines they were trained on the guidelines on this rule book\nBut based on my concern about the background there are things that that I can ... objectively I so\nI usually check many of the things that I think are not\nAcceptable she said whether something was outside the rules are not just forgot told her to she just took it down\nBecause if it's going to disturb the young OB GYNs and he should not be there so like if there's a new person\nWhether it was the breast feeding photo or an anatomy video or a piece of art\nThat was going to say there is an ass pornography\nSo yeah I have to\nProtect kids from those\nA site of humankind [noise]\nWe leave you feeling they'd be doing it this is just to be and this is just I'm\nA new um [noise] I I I think they will inevitably fail but they have to try and and and I think we should all be rooting for the [noise]\n\nYou're listening to Casey of ...

I separated from Morocco by razor wire double fences and militarized border control migrants usually attempt to jump in large numbers to heightened air probability of making it across\nBut I'm curious because like to be able to do this entire Martin I mean that the north of England is not has like the the greatest farmland in the world right\nWhere snakes now is is very much you know it's it's absolutely amount you know but we just talk about the need to get people talking you know because actually I there'll be decreasing amount of land in many parts of the world that we can go to our food down but we still need defeat us out\nSo we need to think about coming around race top so let's close it can come and go up besides the buildings when of course the cat\nAnd well I think it's that happened over the last nine years if people are suddenly on their eyes to space\nAnd seeing their environments in a completely different way and sought hey could grow food on that and it's time testing so even in the north of England we can change the way we led by thinking about why we grow things how do we grow things in ...\nI'm totally moving to time more than in the summer [laughter] yeah or it's great\n[noise] [noise] that more Hearst that movement she started entire Martin and now in towns all around the world [noise] it's called incredible edible you can learn more about it in Tamms full Ted talking to Ted Ted dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay so fruits and vegetables in every corner and ... that's real food right but the problem is that in most modern supermarkets especially in America that is not what we eat\nYou know it's it's sort of the parents have to find things but I Would say a minimum of forty percent of the of the stuff in American food markets wouldn't really qualify as food by the\nDictionary definitions ... percent wouldn't qualify sued well if you think of food food than the definition of food is something that's his things and nurses and yeah and the definition of nourishment is something that um increases your health\nSo if something is not increasing your health but make you ill it doesn't really need the dictionary definition and food\nIs is food writer and cookbook author Mark Bittman his most famous cookbook actually one of the best selling of all time is simply called how to cook everything to people how un airports\n[laughter] it's happened had about not often but yeah it's happened\nAnyway as much as that most of what we eat today isn't real food but it wasn't always like that has marked good men on the head stage\nA hundred years ago just what everyone was a local for every family how to cook usually your mom and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of Europe [noise]\nThere was no snack food and until the twenties adult Clarence birds I came along there was no frozen food [noise]\nMargarine didn't exist\nIn fact when margarine was invented several states pass laws declaring that have had to be died tank so we all know that it was a fake there were no restaurant chains eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic [noise]\nIn those days there was no philosophy of food you're just eight you didn't claim to be anything\nFats cards proteins they weren't bad or good there were food you a ... hardly anything can pay more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient corn flakes hadn't been invented the pop charts the parental cheese whiz none of that stuff goldfish slap\nAnd again every one aide local in New York and orange was a common Christmas presents because they came all the way from Florida from the thirties on road systems expand the trucks took the place of railroads fresh fruit began to travel more are just became common in New York\nThe south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over former\nDefensive if you're well known there everywhere and the deficit family farms as part of this puzzle as there's almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato or even in summer\nEventually California produced too much food to shift fresh so it became critical to market Camden frozen foods loss arrived\nJust in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans once you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now do you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here\nSo I can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nThere are some people who are consuming thirty forty fifty teaspoons of added sugar per day so we've been sort of thing our sugar anti for many many years and of course that's why type two diabetes first became a huge problem in the Nineteen twenties and heart disease in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd then something happened in the Nineteen eighties high fructose corn syrup happened but so is is corn syrup half richest contract worse than can sugar it's cheaper but they're both equally bad yeah they're both equally bad but if it's cheaper it's that it's worse and what that does is also makes sugar cheaper because of the competition\nPlus that was exactly at the same time the low fat directive came out of the U. S. D. A. and the FDA Nineteen Seventy seven the first dietary goals for Americans said eat less fat\nWell if you eat less fat the food tastes like cardboard the food industry knew that so what they do they pumped into sugar and now high fructose corn syrup was cheaper so they could do it ... miles let me give you an example of how this works I think my favorite product of all time lucky\nYeah they're magically delicious and they are right why are there marshmallows in the box cutter delicious secondary by other marshmallows in the box\nBecause they're fun to eat 'cause marshmallows or sheep and goats are expensive to take up more room in the box and they can sell them for more wow great\nAnd the strategy [noise]\nSo everyone says education educate the public as you get published tell what's going on except for one thing education hasn't worked for any other substance abuse the Nancy Reagan just say no work really so\nWhere does that leave us everyone says wait a second don't tell me what to eat well you know what you've already been told what to eat\nWhere were you for the last forty years as your food supplies was being changed under your nose where you're protesting then everyone says get government out of my kitchen you know I don't want to have in my kitchen either unless there's somebody\nMore dangerous already there okay so the real question is who the hell do you want in your kitchen the government who will take your freedom and your wallet\nOr the food industry who's already ticking your freedom your wallet and your health\nThat's your only choice [noise]\n\nSome given that choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food\nAnd the answers can absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states\nOf that four hundred and fifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent\nIs chronic metabolic disease of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry is mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer is real food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable\nFor everyone at that weight I'm assuming the sugar industry really hate you sure yeah they\nIntend words or less yeah they they love me yeah that's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public to make its own informed decision and then but\nNot many people are saying what you're saying I mean you know look\nThere's a lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interest other than taking care of children and seeing children\nGet to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's vested interest [noise]\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you in college yeah just just a little bit of course now and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert for dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal with orange juice and take capri sun and\nA granola bar and that's all before three o'clock you know then you've got a problem\n[noise]\nEver less steak is a
