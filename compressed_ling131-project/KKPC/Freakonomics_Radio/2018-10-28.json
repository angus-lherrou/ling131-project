[noise] NPR [noise]\nGuy Ross coming up I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his Derek all what comedy gave me was this tangible sense of hope\nComedy is like the best tool for that it just opens people up\nWhen we love a loud maybe it encourages us to keep going and not sufficient to them and say I'm not coming out till this over\nThis episode painfully funny for this news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Luis given a\nForty six year old Robert Bowers faces twenty nine federal criminal counts he is scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate judge in Pittsburgh tomorrow among the charges eleven counts of using a firearm to commit murder and hate crimes NPR's Sarah McCammon has more\nSeveral of the twenty nine federal charges against the alleged shooter could carry the death penalty authorities say the shooter made anti Semitic remarks during the attack that killed ... eleven people and injured six others just Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh spoke at a press conference announcing the names of the victims\nThis is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who've been affected [noise] and it's real when once you hear the names the victims\nWere all from the Pittsburgh area they range in age from fifty four to Ninety seven and include a married couple and a pair of brothers Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\nPresident Trump closely followed Pittsburgh developments and offered expressions of deep sympathy and distress for all of this affected the attack preceded a day of to campaign stops the president has said he intends to visit Pittsburgh\nBut as NPR's Mara Liasson reports with general elections less than two weeks away this case and the case of Caesar say oc\nAccused of mailing pipe bombs to key Democrats will inevitably be on the minds of voters\nFor the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nNPR's Mara Liasson reporting from Washington in Germany questions are being asked about whether uncle of Merkel's federal government will survive after\nMajor election losses in the state of has to ask me Nicholson has more\nPut him in the result indicates that both ongoing medical policy the conservative Christian Democrats on tech coalition partner the center left Social Democrats have lost at least ten points each which commentators believes down to widespread disenchantment with the federal government\nKnows ... general sex treats with social Democrat says this is a clear warning signals about it in a\n[noise] that's why women Spock when they will [noise]\n\nHow are you able to react that way like how are you able to to joke about things that other people might just pulled her hair out and get really angry they already you know explode with anger but when I\nWas I think I think that the way to get people to pay attention is to not do that and to not appear like some raging person who wants to been around with that because actually I'm not like that I perfectly normal sensible human being who wants to try and make the best place\nAnd I'm very interested in like keep an eye hair and then you have a big increase in ratings that seems to be a late night shows that are using humor as a weapon in the current political situation\nI I think that is the way forward and nothing is more disarming to protect the new finding them funny yeah why do you call it a punching whose aim is to get a cold day for women the women's equality project blinded should pretend and pull that either the ... budget is wrong with you [laughter]\nIf yeah and also a life is full of things that we believe to be ... which are not true no woman ever been to ... in the sixties it was made up by a journalist\nI even looked it up on the Internet and I could not find anything about\nWhat happened was a whole during my ... young as anything but uh there was a time when a Vietnam the people who didn't want to get him seven the Vietnam War but in the ... and that idea was conflated with the protests that were held at the Miss America contest\nAt the deed crown a sheep Miss America which is funny but nobody seems to remember that so that I Would have liked him seem\nTo me this is this the thing like I suspect that you don't sit around and consciously think I Am going to use humor to advance my ideas but it just sort of your temperament is that\nThe rest of his absolutely and and I have to keep the money that's a bad things happen in the wild about things that make up every day I think really that is happening now which is so hot breaking pulling that the only thing I think you can do is you have to start combining it ah that activism but\nAlso with remembering that by human beings and we have a sense of humor I don't see any other way forward frankly because if you just start before about those things you would just so they\nKnow we're in the world for example the women have equal representation in positions of power they looked like a very quick look at the top one hundred companies in the London stock exchange in twenty sixty one hundred companies uh how many women running\nSeven or I I suppose I realize that seven\nI'll run by men will cooled Joan [noise]\n\nJohn running two hundred company [noise]\nThere Jane run by men who have\n[noise]\nI'm sure David ... job okay [noise] why\nDoes it matter and well it's that pesky business of the gender pay gap or guy not in the wilds do women on the same as men and that is never going to change\nUnless we have more women at the ... in ... with the law or the equal pay act in Britain was posted in Nineteen Seventy five\nNevertheless there are still many many women who from early November until the end of the year by comparison to them male colleagues are effectively working for free I in fact\nThe world Economic Forum estimates that women will get equal pay\nI mean all the examples that you give in your talk like more companies are run by Dave's or John are women who run companies I mean it ... it would be funnier if it wasn't so depressing\nI Know I'm ... I'm just trying to pointed out ah you know life is to is is has many amusing sides to it ah I have to say Mr Trump bless him has been a boon to frankly a boon to ...\nOthers you duress and I didn't get it because my parents were first cousins which they are [noise]\n\nIt only happens from accidents like what happened to me on my birthday\nNow I must warrant it I'm not an inspirational\nI don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me because at some point in your life you have dreamt of being disabled come on a journey with me it's Christmas Eve\nHere at the mall you're driving around in circles looking for parking\nAnd what do you say [noise]\nSixteen and the handicapped face it [noise]\nAnd you're like God can I just feel little disabled [noise]\n\nAlso I got to tell you I got Ninety nine problems than hold Li is just one [noise] if if there was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like Shaquille and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nAgain [laughter] so I think the human capacity you\nKnow the way I'm humans get through these really terrible times is by flipping the script on themselves yeah it kind of let you take a love story back into your own hands\nBegins owned turn flipping the script happened when she was in college right after September eleventh and the start of a wave of Islamophobia\nAnd it started becoming clearer and clearer that Islamophobia is one of those things it's not\nGoing away I kept thinking like oh will be will hate Muslims for like a few months and then we'll stop [laughter] like I just thought that was going to be some reasonable to her doctor [laughter]\nUm and then it never never stopped you know and um and I felt like I could you know I had a voice in that my voice doesn't Iranian American Muslim was\nNot something that the average American has already heard and so they decided that the best way to disarm the haters was to make them laugh and that's been the goal is just um\nYou know if you have never had a Muslim friend um maybe my stupid they can be or my friend\nAnd again does this through what she calls social justice comedy and how it works well here's the gains explanation\nFrom the stage\nCan be broken up into three main categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and Florida traveling category here are the haters\nComedian it's my goal to convert these hairs because they have a lot of things which leads the negative outcomes like a racism violence and Ted Nugent on a plane\nWe have to reckon with the haters but there's various within this group and it's not they should go after all of that right so what is I've created a highly scientific taxonomy of haters I basically took all of haters I put them in a petri dish like a scientist and this is what I found that\nWe have the trolls they're the people who have quit their jobs so that they can post on Youtube videos all day long\nOn their haters now these people will be at a stoplight they'll wait for them to turn green and why they don't treat\nMost interested in is the swing hate or they just because they don't have enough information in the group I liked the target was social justice comedy because\nIt makes you laugh right I don't think you enter into a state of openness and a moment of open it's a good social justice comedian can get a whole bunch of information and if they're really skilled erectile exam [noise]\nFor social justice for us it's not partisan okay this isn't political comedy is about justice and no one is against justice in a warm it makes me feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito it's\nLike you're going to be hearing a real like an interesting treaties on income inequality that change that are really sophisticated poo joke\nOkay so she wanted to do something about Islamophobia and what to look for swing haters\nYeah so me and another ... decided to round up like a bunch of Muslim American comedians I'm mad as per usual\nAnd take him around the country you know what I mean to places like Alabama and Tennessee and missing an era that uh you know what I mean just\nLike places where you are accustomed to seeing like a bunch of friendly Muslims and so we would duty street action we would set up like an act of Muslim biz in the middle of town square really questions\nAbout this long lots of joy just about us we're all trying to join\nWe ply them with pastries so that they can feel like hey someone who's going to give me pastries doesn't have it out for me what would people get tough oh my gosh they could ask literally anything\nWhy do some Muslim women look like you are right\nYou can't tell who they are Rob a bank and you can identify doesn't\nReally go to class you know so we got a question like that all over the country um you know because I don't know where that job and I don't you know cover so you know so like people could ask those questions I don't\nI'm another question that was frequent was why don't Muslim denounce\nTerrorism kill me why I haven't seen Muslim or not for the size of the Muslim or\nWe got that everywhere and I continue to get that and my travels all over the country why don't Muslims denounced terrorism and so there's like a huge PR missteps that happened and where American thing that must have to tell us about terrorism I don't know\nHow this happened because literally every Muslim I Know John I'm like did we not tweet I don't like it did happen\nWhen we come back ... explains why it's important in social justice comedy\nTo keep it delightful show today painfully

Catherine T MacArthur Foundation a Mac found dot org\nIt's a tad radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rush and on the show too painfully funny ideas\nAbout humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life so we're just hearing from comedian begin first thought and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times\nRequired to little patience [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint\nIt's a shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and the gay and took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie\nCalled the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came out something happened back in New York police were and again it usually felt welcomed them accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use about are fine but [noise]\nOh why not macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about my lungs so my fellow comedian dino be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money work for over five months down the road and then we\nWere supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters one I'm not Muslim Muslims\n[noise] let's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe for us are considered political by the NCAA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters can't try fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign\n[noise]\nBasically what I have a couple of comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians want [noise]", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "28"}
