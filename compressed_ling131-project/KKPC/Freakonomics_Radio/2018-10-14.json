I mean music it's like it's like it's like putting salt in the tomato\nYou hit it you got your weight and it and it it's even better than Saturday a terrible analogy is if it's\nBut it just awakens things ... it'll wake and the experience in a way that can actually lead to a consequential outcome the ... it can make people do things and change things and and build things yeah\nNo question about it's the great bring us together with music and it's one thing to hear it in your ear phones all learn\nIt's quite another thing to hear it in concert hall with two thousand other people who are all experiencing it together and you have the sense that people come out to those concerts with the different feeling about life with the different prospect\nYou are news thing about being the person right now that it's going to continue to support Colorado Public radio and programming like this you can do that at CPR dot org or you can call one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen to thirty\nAnd if you do decide to give right now there's an extra benefit you're automatically entered into a sweepstakes to win a trip for two to London\nThis is a seven night trip to Britain you'll be given a fully loaded ... to ... to explore the city some money to planned or some of what you're going to be doing when you're out there this is a huge opportunity and it comes thanks\nTo a CPR sponsors that put it together to encourage your participation in CPR its membership drive um supporters like the IRA and British Airways they want you to give because they know this\nService really matters for Colorado it really matters for people like you\nAnd they want you to join us so you can do that at CPR dot org or call us one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nAnd the London so he thinks it's a great reason to give right now is maybe you've never given to Colorado Public radio before again any amount is going to get you automatically entered to win that trip for two and eighty five hundred dollar value trip or to to London you can do ten dollars a month you can do Fifteen dollars a month\nAnd again if you do ten dollars a month we have a new gift it's a pair of funky CPR socks it's a brand new get for this drive so if you don't eat now you'll be one of the first people\nTo get a pair of socks that had the CPR logo on them be a lot of fun to wear around and again you're gifted any amount is an automatic entry into the London sweepstakes CPR dot org is a place to give or you can call us a one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nSometimes it just sort of relieves that pressure then it just becomes about hearing someone's perspective\nSo you wouldn't responded to his argument you just listen to to what he said I might I might but I start\nBy just listening and asking questions\nBut because he likes being respects me usually he leaves an opening for me to express my feelings and I do I'm honestly without condemnation but you don't it's it's hard for people to open up\nYeah yeah it it's hard that makes you vulnerable yeah it's interesting 'cause it's\nVery true and yet he creates a conflict because you think well the act of listening suggest that those\nViews can be aired public like like you know there's some things that you could say\nPeople should just keep it inside their heads because\nIt's not acceptable to say them or hear them out okay but how well has that worked\nBecause that's been our strategy so far yeah and we're still fighting the civil war\nLook I I\nYou're right about that I I I think that makes sense but at the same\nI Am a wonder whether it's a one way street because by being willing to listen to somebody else you're essentially sending a message that you aren't open minded person and that other person may not be open minded\n[noise] yeah but how do we as a society change that you know one of the things that struck me after the march in Charlottesville they went and interviewed the mother of the man who murdered the anti fascist protester yeah\nAnd she was stunned at what he was involved in and they said did you not know she said no no no no no we never we never talked about that stuff we don't talk about politics\nAnd I thought to myself I Wonder what would have changed in some of these minds if people actually\nDidn't avoid these conversations and allowed human compassion to eventually work because I think when you get isolated into an ideological bubble and you're only hearing people that I agree with you it pushes you further and further toward the fringes\nAnd the dangerous situation we find ourselves\nIn [noise] is that\nMost Americans are now in an ideological bubble [noise] whether they're on the right or the left yeah so it's no longer going to be the fringes unless we begin to pop up the bubble and hear opinions that we find repugnant\nAnd so until we start listening to these opinions we don't like it's going to get worse\nCeleste Headley her book is called we need to talk had to have conversations that matter you can find her entire talk at ... dot com [noise]\nAnd where it left about this conversation Celeste is that it's actually something that we can do to kind of make the world around us a little bit better and that's kind of our goal on the radio hour we want to share ideas with you that give us hope and ideas that hopefully can make the world a little bit better and\nI think you know where I'm going with this because in order to bring those ideas to your radio we need public radio stations like the one you're listening to right now to get that message out so if this show is meaningful to you in any way please consider helping out\nBy giving to the station here's how\nCan you can do it at CPR that orgy or call us at one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen

for you but for the people around you so that when you go to work or\nTo a bar or wherever you have something that maybe you can talk about maybe something that all of you have heard and and can

sweepstakes\nYou can give up CPR dot org colors one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nAnd you are giving right now it's so important especially if you've never given to Colorado Public radio
