Harry\nLimousine traveled across the intersection into a parking lot I'm struck it two thousand Fifteen Toyota highland her that was an occupied and parked to pedestrians standing nearby were also struck and killed\nA wide ranging investigation is now underway to determine what factors lead to the crash the U.S war in Afghanistan began Seventeen years ago today more than twenty four hundred American troops have been killed in that time including a combat death last week NPR's Quil Lawrence reports\nAirstrikes on October seventh two thousand one destroyed in al ... training camp and several Taliban government targets alongside Afghan rebels Americans ousted the Taliban within weeks but at the top objective Osama bin Laden wasn't found it to a decade later hiding in neighboring Pakistan\nIn the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast nine to human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that costs cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets and companies have already raised almost a billion dollars to apply CRISPR cast nine as a therapy and patience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple of decades\nBut five years ago when I started my PHD with Jennifer Doudna CRISPR wasn't a technology at all [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo you're saying this technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how fast has become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's lab that was to any ten\nYou wouldn't find a single mention of Christopher\nIn you know the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable CRISPR ... a but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out\nWe now or at a point today where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't do about Chris ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR to how to study whatever biological question they go after and their laboratories because\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works\nAnd if we know that DNA encodes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what the effects are\nOkay the technical details of how CRISPR cast nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly inter spaced short\n... repeats and cash nine is the key protein that makes it all work that what you need to know if that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy relatively inexpensive to any genes in precise waste any ... any living thing from bacteria to people\nYou know coming back to the four letters of DNA sick about those eight hundred dictionaries filled with the same for letters and now I imagine that you have to search for a single page and not just single page for the single letter on that page and mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an age which is not an agency\nOr an aide to see [noise] so for decades this was the kind\nOf pie in the sky science fiction idea that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter\nAbsolutely that's exactly what it does and I'll just add one copy out it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so if you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of\nGetting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patience\nThe next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health can re achieve the ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine the future you stem cell technology together as CRISPR cast nine to remove disease cells from patients repair them in the lab and the transplant those corrected cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience and I expect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with Christopher entering the pipeline to the next few years\nWhat really got folks speaking this past year was the report in may but for the first time ever scientists use CRISPR cast line to edit the DNA in human embryos\nAnd unlike therapy and adult patients this would introduce heritable changes that can be passed on to subsequent generations you can imagine the controversy that this has provoked and many fear that this technology can be abused\nAll those things right I think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child's even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity we might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with Avi A. F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against this thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nSome of them flush the toilet before using it as well as after and both of them like to I surprised people by sneezing and crowded elevators to watch them junk [laughter]\nStory my seemed too good to be true\nBut ah when you would administer a battery of psychological\nTests or you get the same results namely identical twin separated at birth show are quite astonishing similarity\nThat's just unbelievable so then like even things like like habits or or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and gels and the first couple of years of life ah\nThere are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know\nYeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you undergo a trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars but I think there are certainly a um their statistical forces there's there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah I mean when when you think about like who you are I think ... do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself as basically the same kind of person I like the same music I like same foods\nThe St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests are and then and research on personality shows that there was a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character or as they go through life\nBut ah there are certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred in most people as they as they get older we get less an erotic we get nicer\nOr get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty or he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nSo I mean if we are more or less the same right at at twenty or at Seventy isn't even possible to make big changes to who we are\nI think we have the capacity to change our behavior which is really what counts I I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in a sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and I have easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are proven effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry so intricate re complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social ah mechanisms of of interacted to language to facial expression the body language that there are ways of of changing our\nFeelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation an example and I am and art and of evidence based psychotherapy\nSo there is the scope for for a range of behavior within the ... of a given personality type and we can probe the outside of the on hope that the genes make available to us\n[noise] do you when you think about what what animated person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because the interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are a are tend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion synopsis and no one can keep track of all of them even in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together and not not the exotic cases of the twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins that all of us know\nIf you notice a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar than two people plucked off the street at random but they're unique individuals yeah there you are you don't confuse them when once you\nKnow and sometimes they're not friends\nAnd sometimes they're not friends are indeed a now how do you account for those differences is not there are genes we not the ones they inherited from their parents there could be some uh a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic required\nA it's not there by large their environments because they grew up in the same parents the same school the same house the same older suburbs than younger sibs\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a for a chance for the role of the dice in a who we become because ah to people who have everything in common both the genes and the environmental level nonetheless don't turn out to be a distinguishable\nHarvard psychologist Steven Pinker has given several TED Talks including this one about the blank slate you can find all of them at ... dot com\nOr
