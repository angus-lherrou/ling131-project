I just told you good morning in so he um [laughter] but I forgot how to say good evening so oh okay\nSo great I mean we were just a [laughter] anyhow [laughter] we call Greg out because he had written this article for this great website called trance dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about uh the failure to communicate I can tell you that story that you are yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it as a translator but it's the words furious\nAnd when you get a job or you're in a serious like how can you help us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this where it's serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern it actually almost never has something to do with your mood\nFor serious tends to me is are you just talking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bribe oh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um but the story that I Want to tell you as\nGood afternoon everybody I'm I'm really pleased to be a doctor in Africa Secretary Kerry visited Ethiopia and city of a norm is energy and just a few\nDays before carry visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism if the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and Secretary Kerry was giving his press conference I shared my concerns about a young age opium blogger that I met last year or ... who ah\nWith eight of his peers I've been in prison and I firmly believe that the work of journalists weather as print journalists are in the Internet or\nMedia but other times it makes societies stronger\nYou know you've got all the things you do you expect him to say that um we believe that free speech and open dialogues important to the economic development of country buffet blah but\nWe remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia\nWith this comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise of Ethiopia and\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took them vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carries\nCredit or give us Joan I Want to give them a shot I Know he was very impatient I'm sort of four he left the party and he was like you know what we're just going to try something different we are going to like\nCall an Ethiopian journalist I Want to make sure you had a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed this one guy in the second row a young guy in his twenties boyish face wearing a moustache I've only to Christians flu set\nI may have invited artist question of the day that but one question Sarah okay\nSo let me she was\nA love raised double ... or not to name a liquor\nWho was at Logan in these friends that are in much then this guy's like well every time a journalist is arrested the U.S gives a statement about this by these things out of this keep happening repeats of repeating\nVery much so then he asked the question is you leap set of east or audio seriously\nBecause that or a double it's ... it's just lip service or are you serious\nAt this point everybody is just not looking Teri they're all looking at these journalists who obviously had to take\nConsiderable personal rest in place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV station she's this guy's on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrested journalist really ... it ...\n... and Teri and looks at him like well\n[noise] you've got to be kidding where I stand up in public and I and I and I say something um I I tried to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments\nToday I carry sense to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nIs the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much is are you doing something preferably I'm In my natural transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is when are you just talking about this or are you doing something\nMay be threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or with strong support in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy\nThank you all very very much for it\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me not being serious\nWe put it in a number of requests to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response do you think he was aware of the misunderstanding to carry on this uh this film oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is on any actually he's a young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you listen what happened there and I must sound like some kind of cultural a guide ...\nAmericans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African spacey serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could not just speak are you going to\nDo yeah this is as us exactly my point is are you going to take sanctions maybe going the other person's yeah do you feel that that question for you at risk maybe who knows is that does the job description doing good journalism in Egypt you\nMake so much think you think do you mean from my numbers on there\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did you know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether did he suffer for this question in any way nobody had his phone number so I can give them a call in and sign up\n\nAnd I and many exits Gregory Gregory Warner oh legally audience I enjoyed I good I\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nYeah I got to lighten up we are going on together to them in the Arctic shipping and that the\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah\nThese messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism task force will wage social media tax by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\nBelieve in on the theater and he's in the Gulf ... out of the ones that are saying these kind of when they say\nAnd were they threatening yeah\nSome of it where you know in some skiing in the ... the French Quarter during the wintertime comes and it might come one day\nThe newspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nSick like safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother and I been ding us Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry yeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that ... what is your mom say\nSo you you do you do for a little boy I'm\nNot going to do and I mean you do\nYou do a little bit of God is going on and then I'll go through Yankee Doodle\nLesson number four imagine a lot of Coca Cola like bubble for your tone for ... for the deaf people you'd be overcrowded now your truck [noise]\n\nPretty good [noise] this is Emily my name's Emily ... artist\n[noise]\nSome of you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily where she'd been hit by a truck\nGoing into a coma and her boyfriend at the time Alan or had brought her back my writing on her hands\n[noise]\nAll the stories we've ever done this one has gotten the most response and when we left that story Emily had emerged from the Komen begun to recover\nBut she was blind totally blind right\nYeah and like no light any nothing coming in now okay needless to say it was a very big adjustment\nI just know I just had to develop my own ways to\nNavigate throughout the world and chest myself and\nAnd being a visual artist she had to develop new ways\nTo draw I had ... and if you ... it's hard enough you can feel the wax on that paper um yeah\nBut then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call from the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah is that school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology\nI think they were doing this study for the FDA\nVery experimental among thunder a long story short a Emily shows up the lighthouse school one day and walks into this room and a guy named ed gives her this thing he get his device can you describe it I mean is it a big moment no it's\nNot it's just say and regular pair of sunglasses\nThough they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says because of right on the front like on the bridge in the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attached to the sun glasses was a little wire\nThat ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing has made a titanium and it's just like the size of a postage stamp or a little bit thicker though\nThat explained or is it a little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square plays it on your town put it right on the center of your tongue\nAnd cause your mouth so I put it on and they\nTurned it on 'em and it was like is there is to take all imagine a lot of cars they call a like a lot of levels on your town and always like frankly regularly and feeling\nThe idea behind this thing called a science writer Sam Kean author of detail of duly neurosurgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing in our ears and during the hearing and our fingers in ... and the teasing attaching\nBut that's actually not her words each of our sensors send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves and it is the brains then converts of little blips into what you perceive as a site or sound or smell no obviously\nSomeone who was blind to the retina is not sending those signals anymore but what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brains\nIn all of our brains there are lots and lots of pathways going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist like there's a road there but it's shut down in traffic can be on it\nBut what if you could open up some of those ...\nHe just let me as I say with an eye for an hour into our\nEmily says at first she had no idea what was happening she would just as with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change and\nEvery time I looked around he said oh that's a chair that door that's me\nYour mom and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square applies to nana and nothing's really high\nFor except for the prickly feelings on her tongue but then there was this moment\nAdd had this really long Styrofoam rod and the last day in front of me he moved at I sit down and find the right thing [noise] and ... oh my God it was a [noise] suddenly she says she just thought it was like oh my God [laughter] it just happened\nLast oh what did it look like in some of The Mind's eye it\nLooks like a long white skinny stick\nYou see the texture of the sticker um no\nI couldn't see texture I couldn't see in three dimensions it was very\nFlat and it's kind of like that kid's toy light right yeah they're alleging like a black screen and little tiny white dots\nAll arranged in a way\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the light right resolution of it did get better as her brain learn to speak to him it was awesome\nWhen I saw people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it sent me showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street told me they usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown where the streets are lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI hardly ever notice either people walking around me it feels like\nI can I hear the ... and it sounds a tactic ...\nWhich he says we split the device on and put a sensor on her tongue the sidewalk\nWhen [noise] came alive [laughter] I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people around the street at the same time as me and now they're um [noise] they're all there again which you describe doing away with it sounded\nAlmost like a painting like\nReally soft a chance in everything that sounds nice soft watches as he\nCan move\nThere is why can't I can see their life living and I can see them their gate but I can see them clear you know like I can see ... or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt address has a just like see their shadows\nAnd every now and and I see the light pass it on them really yeah\nI've mentioned somehow like underwater creatures uh-huh squishy jelly fish like yeah\nYeah like lady yeah\nYeah like that [laughter]\n\n\nAnd that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is a hazy sea of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine\n[laughter]\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain port and you can check that out by going to radio abducted poured\nNo oh
