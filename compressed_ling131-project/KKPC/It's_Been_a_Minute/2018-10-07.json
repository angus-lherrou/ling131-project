I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come out and\nMan when children they oppose them on a daily basis\nFor like two days you see them on television that big bad dude was my twin brother\nThat big fat and do [noise] was a time\nThen they kind of recede\nThey're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then [noise] you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happened is they get like folded\nUp into this network\nThe ... the little ...\nAnd so at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big brown dining tables\nResources once upon a sign of all there were ...\nThere was no winners symptoms and who wants to do was ...\nOr ... hot dogs you know\nWe're ... for low for the summer\nAnd so after the prayer Christel House in back in the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nBy just totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic table\nIn his mind just uh I mean I'm not going to make no one like oh no no no no comment which is where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was wondering for early don't you just described for me what we got on the table because I'm just ah what not to have you had to work on it I mean this the cable writer so I think you have to have you have to have on you\nGod what about you got to ask you get your Britain and you've got to bake it you've got your sausage you got everything you want to have to get nice good full day\nI got to get your name show in Geneva Greenville I'm the mother Sandra Bland and keeps you don't remember [noise]\nTrials holders for something that you didn't\nSenior plan is pulled over in a small town in Texas the cop runs or information comes back to the car\nIn front of your cigarettes please\nAre low right now out of the car and not have the right to do that I Do have the right now I Will remove get her long for us out for our movie I'm giving you a lawful order\nDuck will\nTell us\nYou meant to be seen her teeth out of the car but you know you don't often get it over\n\nMuch\nSandra was eventually taken in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found dead hang with the plastic garbage bag the death is real the suicide and sinners family disputed that ruling\nYou've got everything you want to have to get nice good full day [laughter] I\nI got to get him a show in Geneva Greenville I'm the mother Sandra Bland\nRain coming from I gotta I Want to let you ah eat your food I one thing I Would have to have you come to come to an event like this before Oh yes sir quite a few of us in Missouri last week [noise] um we go all around we try to avoid it many mothers that\nWe can because it's important that exactly like that what it is is it really just like a force Yes sir it's a good point because that mother who have lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else who looks like them in the same situation that they are as opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something better than I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talk to you when you get the sense that their their experiences is really unique sort of law\nIt's up to lose somebody a cancer of lost friend the cancer recently Amtrak\nIs a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his first wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves they they\nTell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults greater right as long as I'm having\nTo get into ... brown somebody\nThen something happened in you know here in Florida\nAnd then we're going to begin with and it looks a club that nobody really wants to be\nSay family more than just\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or no no just wanted to address their nose in Missouri and has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but thinking this must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping ... right right we all just simply trying to find our way is the first of all gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the large stage a certain point because it was talking to these two women and she's had this big bundle of stage in her hand\nOkay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go on to my house she says his age comes around you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then I then went from the gym shop over the crystal\n[noise]\nMidsize one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen cooking chicken\n[noise]\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd [noise] now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we starting to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe sleep in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other a ... or the vice chose results like therapy for\nVicki is let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add I'm Marlon promise to\nAnd it was when crystal let some of us over\nTo the site where uh her ex husband Marlin was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nWe usually the video that just came out a video\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call execution a vegetable garden 'cause the guardian was here in\nAnd I think in a you know I've read a lot about implicit bias and now it seems like I'm just like feels like a kinder way to say here like a fear of a black person in that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop when\nYou look at some of the shootings you record on video and I and I think of the poorer\nSchool janitor who lost his life in Minnesota oh the clinic steel city there's a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms I'm a good guy I have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo when the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason\nThat officers threat level with a baby in the car\nAnd I got a guy in his ... his kid his girlfriend according to almost gone from an older this is this is an easy car stuff for some reason and and the reason is because of the color of the main skin all those things never registered black guy receivers black his pocket and I should and and I would like to tell you in all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be not even tell you\nThat we don't cheat on more people and the twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation cop\nI'm appalled at what I see on those videos I cannot believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control some of them I understand what's going on I mean wrestling and run for your life and you and and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me and you're looking at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already operating at this level of heightened fear or the perceived\nThreat in my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using it real life scenarios that take that extra split second before you fired your weapon and I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people\nAt a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved ... jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had to reach reach trained on how to keep your finger on the site plate the weapon not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you might have thought it was Armageddon oh my God they're gonna get killed on reality what it did was each slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second to make a difference that blood given I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your knock shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been\nThat the color of my glass coming out and my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again is this idea of time in certain situations slow down\nWhen you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down like whatever you can do he was covered just creates in space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you're saving your life in somebody else's life\nAnother interesting thing was in Ben Ben found is that also through some of the reporting with other police cheese\nIs the idea that some ... cheese they only hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because everything that there was this text allowed\nUs only know how to communicate it's like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and and I'm Serious about whether the drive to a McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that he talked to different police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which the problem because when they get into a fight their hearts stretch the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and they're way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons to uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on your nose so that then says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bounces or for chip what he said\nFrom just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they are my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the policy\nBasically know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff but we they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day you\nHave to get to know people yeah for sure and so to make this point it would get up walking down the hall to another office of a semi down on the computer the sounds of us when he says okay\nShowed me this video to video starts in highland center the body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car and he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as you said is a partner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people he's off his meds I think he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly\nThey park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away from this\nShirtless black guy and you show up there that's the kind of talking to them cop were in the body cam and this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I gets closer and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body can pulls out the ... the other officers out it was added a frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nI put it down is approaching\nApproaching approaching a protein and now he gets within like ten feet of the cops and then\n[noise]\nThe guy was buddy team fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto its back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\nYou're gonna get hit again are you going to get it\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he was over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over and then she\nChanged central four\nCups and then\nThere may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot out the other side of your best shot I say if you want to die if you want a guy you can die\nHe told the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of our parents really want to\nBe to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what it does warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that whenever they are now you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner who is holding the gun have you heard that you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching the video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood I miss it on the front step waves of hatred what are you doing man Derek doesn't stupid set up a bit you don't have close came to be in bed wouldn't be back with his medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again uh almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say ... primary election among the big winners Daytona they just ... he is now ... county sheriff Mike Schmidt would was elected the sheriff of Linn county [noise]\nI Am\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition of police chief and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life\nNow just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Pueblo", "day":
