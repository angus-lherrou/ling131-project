I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab and just before the break we were about to hear Robert Guerra the man accused of murdering a teenager [noise] Cho his attorney what really happened\nYet and we're going to jump right back into that but uh if you're just tuning in now you should be warned that there have what comes next is uh probably not suitable for the years have young kids are sensitive listeners so be warned that will go back\nTo report urban affairs at this point it was just ... in the room and he told him yes he had killed them play ski and he also killed other people\nToo and the episodes when Darrow killed people seemed to have followed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches and you know become psychotic and\nDo horrible things when it came to the details he tended not remember but then Gary mentioned two particular girls who were then missing\nAnd whose parents had no idea where they were\nTwenty one year old Susan pads and another girl sixteen year old ... [noise]\nSusan pets was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned earlier cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information\nEarlier that summer her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them that they'd camping and Susan had been gone ever since\n... she was a high school girls from Syracuse she'd gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run away but\nGuerra told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their bodies one odd thing about arrows description of the incidents he doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine night\nShe touch with my night like it wasn't even in doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself is this true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be a dreamy had it could be a delusion\nYou're going to go and um you know crafting argument and and present a strategy you need to know\nUh what actually happened W walked out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go so they they slip outside they get in the car and we take off to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mind is up in mind ... about an hour south of the hospital ...\nFederal runners and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you're you're up high it's high but you're scared you're concerned yes fear your food if you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police so eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving the lady friends a car to try to lose the trails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis measure as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father says it's on a road that goes to the minded or what is fair to them on it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nBecause I'm very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly feet there were no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Serious skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here\nSoon right up there so here we are in our son do shoots every goes trudging choose for is looking for the\n[noise]\nSpent hours looking [noise]\nNone [noise]\nWe found this for ...\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this is getting any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's\nGot a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down and there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this which does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of here\nWho made backup that\nEventually the algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when ... founder\nSo what ensued was a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about\nThe bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we\nTook you know to keep your confidences over wire\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nYou you are you're questioning yourself very\nYou're hurting people so you begin to wonder um are you in the right profession you know you're looking for and you're looking for a way to give the information you know you know will make you know most coal\nSure why didn't you\nKnow [laughter] if I'm gonna do it and we're doing openly\nNo ah I don't know\nDid he ever did you ever break\nKnow according to him now you know in my mind was doing what I thought was the proper ethical and legal Morrow moral thing\nTo do and then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girls disappear their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other students bodies discovered by two kids were playing up in the mines Alicia um I guess it's I think a student from Syracuse University which is right next door to the\nCemetery is walking through and and stumbled upon her and so she has discovered than to and then six months later in the summer of Nineteen Seventy four\nOpening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though\nRobert ... trial for the murder of el ... ski begins\nRobin ... primary line of defense or apparently being not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decided to do is is to put Darryl on the stand and you just get the facts and Guerra would tell his whole life story to a shock the jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes to see as you look at the time he was nuts Sharon Smith Jemma flicks news in pleasant\nSo the trial opens um the courtroom\nIs jam packed prosecutions starts they have a really good case they've got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County\nAnd then it's time for the defense to start their case so Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand Garrett gets on the stand and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible [noise]\nSevere beatings and abused by parents very little education basically gets\nSent off to a farm to work like as an indentured servants when he's seven slaughtering bowls and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he starts like drinking blood I'm having sex with the animals and then he starts admitting to a series of rapes\nThroughout his adult life and he admits the killing Alicia and Susan and what happens next nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when ... was talking about Susan pets bell gee says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found ... so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian Armani will the press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nFor bars without Robert does the ... because they had the duty to protect our clients secret for reading or the broader world here but\nEveryone is disgusted those columns written editorials written letters to the editor\nOr just no way in the world you're going to convince your average non lawyer if everybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby ... justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that our money in Belgium actually tried to use these dead girls at ...\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of la ...\nOur money was getting death threats in the mail and I'd just as for the phone call people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself to kill you really have to at one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard you started to carry a pistol my bag he kept shock on in the car he kept one in the house so\nWe could sleep it was that was the worst moment to or [noise] or some horrible for\nHis marbles it's\nJune twenty seventh rubber Guerra who was convicted for the murder of Philip bump whiskey he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how ... how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nBut then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they should bring against ...\nSoon after the verdict our money and do you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but\nBe something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or state public health law and the provision that says the body must be given a quick indecent burial and on top of that\nWe're looking for the worms murder career or for workers\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarmament an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nWell gee started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice moved to Florida or body tough it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or loosely well what else can do\nTo make the movie he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the parade oh will destroy Russian pressure to to to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that what Belgian or money did\nWas write what they did was good exactly\nAccording to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to do this job\nAnd I was a good lawyer ...\nArt everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and build you did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham\nWhy don't just stand up and I agree um his duties to his client she represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can see in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nThe from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta patch and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI\n'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things and an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me", "year": "2018",
