lucky the house didn't explode yeah\nWhere are you afraid that you'd be using ... mother did and because she a grant grandparents drank a lot like how did that affect you and when you got old enough to consider alcohol or drugs yeah I\nI you know I always feared that I Would fall into that those those same stuff so I was always very prudish about having a drink or anything like that and I knew addiction was in the family and it was hereditary\nAnd I and I knew that it was dangerous territory to to dabbling thing so uh you know come college remember my freshman year of college and I I was at University of Hartford I wasn't it rode on school and design just yet I remember that you suddenly given this freedom when you're drinking all the time and I remember sort of hitting a wall\nOf like whoa like I'm drinking almost every single day this is unhealthy this isn't good I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps\nOf the uh my my both my parents had stuff and addictions and their addictions on both sides so ah so I was always very wary and very careful of that and um\nMy mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated or we she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would drop say she would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the pink panther someone I withdraw her the pink panther and and I would write back and request Garfield\nAnd I remember as a very young person seeing how talented she was\nBut she had such squandered that talent or because of the drugs and that really was my driving force to to want to get published you know I was I was submitting book proposals to publishers when I was a junior in college\nYou know when you're writing from the point of view as a child and your graphic memoir he can't tell you can find your mother and said to her you chose drugs over me mhm how do you see it now as an adult\n... having seen the fact that she couldn't help herself to the very and\nYou know that the the the mindset has shifted someone that she did choose for whatever reason to use drugs and she used at such an early age so it's hard to you know how to judge who started when she was Thirteen Thirteen Years old I'm\nYou know my grandparents got her own place when she was Fifteen thinking that would solve the problem what can we give a Fifteen year old their own place or whatever was going to happen\nUm she wasn't able to help herself at the very throughout her life she just kept going back to it the one thing that I Do still have a heavy heart for is she still was never able to take ownership so yes she had a disease and yes she suffered from addiction\nBut she was never able to say I had sorry about that [laughter] you know she's still even as an adult she'd say you had everything you needed like when are you just kind of get over it I'm sure I had Nintendo when I had all of these GI Joes and thunder cat action figures\nBut I didn't have her and that's I and I and the tough part really is knowing who she was and who what her heart was that she would have been such a good mother and such a great grandmother if if she had to worry about to do that\n[noise] it's been such a pleasure to talk with you thank you so much and good luck at the national book or thank\nYou you know I got to say I listen to the show so much this feels like it was a choose your own adventure pot [laughter]\nLike I couldn't just say and I draw and listen to you

I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter]\nSo we must we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may wanna might wanna yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning or that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] I was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nWhat do you have a\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want and Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say I'm just like ... what we\nAnd then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for every oh can we go through some sort of the ridiculous examples we let's over here today so Gore Gore you mean violence kind of Gore yes the Gore standard was\nHeadlined we don't allow graphic violence and Gore and then the shorthand definition they used was no insides on the outside\nNo guts no blood pouring out of something led was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule to come up with rules about bodily fluids\n... for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does a clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked people that were paintings or sculptures come up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in is can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal made out of stone really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like\nIs this what you can see with your eyeballs and so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly get updated constant amended yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule\nIn fact at this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month wow really take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed\nThe attachment clots so the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nipple of the woman no end in fact\nA one nipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that both nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nFood is what happens in American walk all the time it's very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law [noise] so common law is\nThe system dating back to early England where individual judges would make ruling which would sort of\nBe a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges the the body of law was sort of constantly flashed out in the seventies facts [noise]\nLiterally every time this team that Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight ... some things I don't think we're just show up and said that they weren't prepared for that and that's a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about this\nFor example sometime around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue or things\nThat are jak [noise] ... [noise] kept\nAnd she comes upon this image in\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressed in skin breastfeeding goats of baby goats and the moderator throws her hands up and says what gives this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was the thing it turns out it's a survival practice\nAccording to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought a known way to help your herd get through the drought is to ah if you if you have a woman whose life dating\nTo have her nurse the kid the baby goat along with her human get ...\nAnd so there's nothing sexual about it's good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant it it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue that but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple but but obviously\nBreastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment an ass strict under the rules stating animals are not babies we add to that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they removed that they they did was I was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo yet that outraged individuals or editor CERN wheeler\nWhy why did we make an exception because because when a problem grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't this was not one of those cases the juice wasn't worth the squeeze\nAnd like if they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay\nThis is a utilitarian document it's not about being right a hundred percent of the time it's about being able to execute effectively\n\nIn other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be one hundred percent just or fair would just try to make something that works\nOne two three four five six seven eight and when you step back and look at what Facebook has become like for two thousand eight to now in just ten years'\nTime in that chair tower came in LA and I know that is one of the idea of it\nSingle set of rules that works that can be applied fairly has just a crazy crazy concepts\nBecause they've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to the ...\nCampaign would say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone from twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere is a floor in the building where states such as sources content moderators itself\nAround twenty ten they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter or a home in drawl as well as\nI mean I Would die for their building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stuck seem or the other two suspects to treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people who for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow ... ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like [noise] well\nI thought I'm going to ask you some questions that we\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nSo there's a lot of renting leaving me happening\nAnd not certain about the good work [laughter] so now I Am I thirty is you know sorry she worked in\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's the is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that is totally fine you know I was going to an victory I don't want to take up here\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract are headed I talked to about ... watch\nOne several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want yeah\nI I knew I signed up to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ...\nJust like just a case forty five thousand test every day I was just at lunch at a fishing village decision\nWhich fight five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like they all the ... ah it's too at age ... X rated\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people cages injure our cherry like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over I although I like over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and that is you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be a good\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat there were no specific like it is but I couldn't watch it was why I like ... ... S C I was like okay I got I like ... like I have to walk away\nAnd I just have to I I chose to real [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nJust means literally nothing [laughter] give us an example of this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers cab driver would be the non\nProtected modify or because employment is not a protected category and so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion\nWe would allow it because we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected category of black mhm and so children Trump's black\nTheir child ... Trump's their blackness you can say whatever you want about black children whereas in the case of white men uh you've got a you've got gender and race both protected you can attack them\nThat's just a bizarre rule I Would think you'd go the other direction to eat the protected class would outweigh the\nModify well they they made this decision as they explained to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition\nAnd so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend or the valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we'd say this is so bad we're going to take it down and in this case their concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected category like we all have gender we all have sexual\nOrientation and if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech\nWhat you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone on Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right\nNo matter where we draw the line there are going to be south some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle that they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they consider the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration but despite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic effort to eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech makes sense well\nYeah because in sort of hate speech or are thinking about hate speech\nThere's this idea of of privilege or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection or because of being historically disadvantaged ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nYou Japanese reinforced in the Nineteen forties off the side\nYou had Japanese soldiers tens of thousands of Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two at the same time you had Japanese American citizens than a hundred\nThousand persons of Japanese ancestry all for\nBeing put into internment camps and so we had to ask ourselves a question like\nAre the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story and this happened at the exact same moment if they've got to different places to different cultural stories\nIn ... when you have a website like Facebook this trans National Community they realized what they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond that there is no way to have actually way way and consider\nWho is privileged above who undecided therefore that we're not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all Mm Mm Mm\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here and in American these moderators only have like four or five seconds Republican become ... to make a decision\nAnd limited and even in those\nFour seconds is there enough time to to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given I'd be addressed as can easily be ... go back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person ethnicity white children are better on black children ... ... on top of that we often do\nAnd individuals rate strange people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of cat and we saw some times that it was just too hard for our reviewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nIn converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe in when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses\nThat that um that's the tension here\n[noise]\nAnd I just want to make sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't treat everybody that's working on the policy team at face but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently\nThat it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white or but\nWhen we come back those rules they get toppled so\nThis is Kenny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation in Hampton public understanding of science and technology
