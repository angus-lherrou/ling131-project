George started ... ready to wait a campaign by women who believe that the decision to allow in old women is wrong and she joins us now on Charlie welcome to the program as a woman why you against allowing old women into the temple give us a quick round off of your position\nOn Arab that's that's the thing is that this\nAbout demonstration all the age ... age of the woman but they did about that diet do in the ...\n... each time but it has its own dynasty and each diabetes different in each character and it's a wants and desires\nSo that at this particular timber shop but he ... a year but in but the idea of them but it is that oh it's only in this them but so that did this ... is an ethic and young a teenage boy who can do up to the heat and these in deep meditation and he is following\nA nice to go but much idea which is a mind do they eat up all a wolf celibacy which he needs\nTo be going right into his okay right right certainly in your point is that it's particularly about the safety who was was shipped in this temple\nCost about the principal because I Know that the country's Supreme Court has made similar decisions in other temples do you think that they were rights to do that in the case of the other temples\nHere in this particular a judgment of the Supreme Court accepts they blindly off a blanket blanket they gave a blanket us I don't do that all kind of\n... who's had relations related to\nWomen in everybody temple and get this particular state of the law which is if it's not just this one time but so they didn't completely analyze the uh the the the scheme do side of Hindu point of view point of view and the\nUh the rails things that you know they they didn't look at ... ... ... people\nRight now I understand that no one thing that has been reported news agencies is that some women are being stopped from traveling now do you support that kind of action people being pulled off these people are being demonstration against I mean I Know that you've started a hash tag\nAt maybe ... is from our BBC um hard service in Nairobi and I spoke to her earlier\nOr the prime minister downsized the ministry of his from twenty to twenty or enrich ministry such as governmental a communication I face a office dissolved\nA and the reason he gave it as close to minimization\nTo an institution ... and also to get the rest of the people when it comes to government institutions but I don't think the shuffling the carbonate and downsizing the ministry of his is a is not a new thing\nAnd then you send them in a is a half of the minister said women including a the key positions so but it's such a ... on that a plane to the minister of defense and she's the first woman to hold such position and the country's history\nAnd ... who served as the speaker of the parliament for the past like much as ... piece it's then you pour a portfolio\nAnd recharge your portfolio while I understand that cheese in the hierarchy in the grand scheme of things she's right after the prime minister\nYeah yeah ah so shouldn't be overseeing the countries and not on the east\nShe's not only the pits minister bet she'll be overseeing the country's intelligence and ... and also including the benefits when police commission so it's it's it's very powerful and yeah like you said it's a within the country is not ... the prime minister\nAnd the prime minister made really interesting comments about well how about why he chose and half of his cabinet and to be women what did he say\nSo basically what she said is a women are less corrupt and they respect their jobs\nAh yeah and also to break a conspiracy politics which donated the county that in the past and I did capes or so when he that's why he actually are both women into\nHigher it's interesting though ... it's an interesting generalization ... because he's trying to say I'm bringing along because they work hard and the and they're not corrupt and while some women might find that flattering others might say well actually you know men and women can can be corrupt what's been the reaction to this comment\nSo I was actually a money thing social media and the discussion among feminist seconds\nOr saying are being cut not putting a gender or somebody criticizing his speech or using a stereotype and ... I mean that's the ... the notion that women are let's go now to stick their jobs\nBut they also parts of the system I think it's a mischaracterization of um a that's a what ... saying but also a an addition to that some men who are saying yeah\nLet's see also a winning holding disposition is\nEh eh yeah [laughter] oh maybe things might be different\nI mentioned it to know what the reaction has been to the women holding these key positions as you say the ministry of defense minister piece basically responsible for an intelligence and police what has been the reaction to their employment ... people generally been positive were questioning their qualifications for these positions\nI mean so far people are delighted about this intimate met with the uh with the ministry of defense especially people that are raising the question of a ... performance\nI think this is sort of a double standard because this get to the question when not raised with the former minister of defense or see that's where the guy who did not have any ... a background\n... Selassie take out all their from our BBC America service on the reef shuffle and half of the minister ministers in Ethiopia cabinet now are winning [noise]\nI was very important meeting of the world Health Organization it's experts today are going to the side of the committee responsible\nIs going to decide something that might sound a bit technical but bear with us we will try to explain whether or not the ... outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo constitutes\nA public health emergency of international concern now in W I show language basically that means it is an extraordinary event and uh the suspicion is that there is a danger that the disease may spread across borders and Rick was a vigorous international response\nNow the center of the government's response to the current outbreak is the ... health minister ... who joins us now minister first off\nOn the conditions on the ground can you tell us or what is the latest that you are hearing in terms of casualties on whether you feel it is a situation which is still escalating\nSay good morning and thank you very much for Russia's arrogance says so far we have\nA two hundred and fiction cases a hundred and ... and that's and the fifty seven fifty seven survivors so far so far as um I think that the situation is a is it started in August and ah we\nAre working or rented relatives tool to ... or so far as I think that there is a nice quiet under control\nOkay in that case can I ask when it comes to the W. H. O. deciding whether they should call it as a public health emergency do you would you recommend that they should do that and what difference would it make on the ground\nSo from my point of view on at the international level it might lead to tread and frustration but however in the field my discouraged genes we have been working on the trip because\nSince August you're working out great as quickly as possible and in spite of all the challenges\nAre going to make a good job and you can you imagine the outbreak as a ... on that they've been able to manage to contend with virus in\nIt or this and grown in Lebanon for weeks and that despite all the risk of the the virus hasn't spread in neighboring countries or never encourage us so far right well I think that\nThe people are already doing it rich despite all the challenges ahead of him and this is a bunch of rich attrition venue is particularly because we had to face at the beginning of restructuring of resistance but even on that front much ...\nWell the space community resistance and also the armed groups operating in the area as well um but we'll neighbors be happy to hear you say that as far as you're concerned it's under control because they will be extremely worried about it crossing borders are they satisfied with with your uh your assurances\n[noise] no I I think that from the beginning the the risk of spreading of the disease to record your country is up in your risk for the risk is there since August every able to come in\nAnd the and we have throughout Europe ... working at the point of entries so I think people are really doing a lot of things to talk on\nMy I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure a great deal is being done ... I I just need to to ask you pure and simple do you want the W. H. O. to college and public health emergency will not\n[noise] not we don't want because since the beginning it's a risk and you already are managing it as a as a big risk and from our point of view it wouldn't change anything from\nResponse we're governor trees original good for you all up to the beginning of the country is just not going to respond it's international response under good either she poker governance\nWell I Want to thank you for coming on and giving us the latest one house minister\nOf deal can go a little ... about the situation I'm In the Democratic Republic of Congo as regards it ...\nAh he was trying to do to close to the many people who are fighting it both from the government NGO sides but are you saying there of course they're still cultural difficulties that many people are alarmed by people coming in hazmat suits the kind of advice that they'd given on burials and\nAlso the author and do it to be armed groups that some of whom have attacked the uh ...\nYou're listening to it and you stay on the b._b._c.

involved\nUm you know to express our general dismay with the direction that our national conversation seemed to be taking 'em and I having worked abroad always traveled to eat and learn about different cultures through their foods for me\nAnd my lining myself with a refugee costs about like a very natural set 'em and I knew that there were a lot of things going on you know worldwide but also in New York City I'm Around refugees and food which I mean just made all the sense in the world because\n[noise] you know because of the way it brings us together and emphasizes our commonality\n[noise] um and so I just felt like it was a place where my skills that could really be of value um and so I started hosting at first just fundraising dinners for various um Syrian refugee related causes in my home um and I\nStarted discussing the project with the various resettlement agencies around the city and telling them what sort of women I was looking for and I'm over the course of the spring and summer of two thousand Seventeen we built our team\nAnd how does your team where would you do you've you put on meals maybe as you mentioned it begins with meals in your home how's it expanded kind of things you ...\nOh sure so um we continue to do our potluck dinners but we also there was a refugee food in arts festival put on during the U.N General assembly week last year\nAnd

talented home cooks you know when I went around to the agencies and kind of decide what I was looking for I said you know it's it's the woman whose eyes light up when she talks about food you know not just them you'd put dinner on the table because\nIt's part of her responsibility to do that for a family that women were really excited about food you know and immediately the by contact the agencies would smile you know oh yeah I Know exactly what you should talk to you there's always someone who's bringing food into the office who who just can't stop herself from you know putting putting putting something delicious and you're not\nA book on a couple of songs do have I mean is there a language barrier still a an does food get around that\nYeah absolutely um you know it depends some of the

mentioned choice but what sure I think is also talking about is the culture is the information as well is that getting through\nThis is exactly the point that the decision about when to have a baby is one of the most intimate decisions and many people are making this decision without preparation without access there are over two hundred million women who would like to have the ability to plan their family as shower decided to do but\nDo they have access in the clinic or they welcomed a is the young girl in particular protected\nFrom having a baby too soon all of this implies that choice could

the control over their bodies they don't have the control over when to marry one to have a child\nThere there's still a great deal of gender discrimination of depriving many women have the power of

I'll Ross\nWith the ... now to the world of video games and you may have heard of one called Fortnite\nIt's a big global hit with online gamers with tens of millions of players across the world for the initiated Fortnite is a collaborative shoot 'em ups survival game essentially\nIt's also a big money generator and now the creators ... are you assuming one player Brandon Lucas who was posted videos online on how to cheat while playing the game [noise]\nOh how big of a problem is that when the online video get within the online video game industry let speech Eli Gibson video games journalist who joins us in the studio great to have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game Fortnite I don't play but I've heard of it how was it a global in a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game moved down to the game I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy include a season policy which about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to sort of cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy things and pause and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted online there and why the company at the games is suing that player\nBrandon Lucas so you find a new cars is accused of making these tax to the game and sending them\nAnd these are ... to cheat basic cake so he's maybe ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been sending these ... to the game online\nAnd but I'll put the two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yeah and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people who have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software afford night\nThat's when they basically accusing the paper of copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that for all you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one though surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nSo this is in fact New Jersey's argument is that he's being singled out he believed in fact he says knots and knots of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they were ... they they are trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to start somewhere and perhaps they're trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know there's not even a fast food night rainy they vote yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think in um uh this is a different game actually paranoid and bustle grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hiking the game um yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating in games\nAnd like many things he gets in their video games journalist joining us life\nHas been shooting and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit mono a twenty two minutes possibly out now Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana for consumption and so you regard was pushed the protests began a few hours ago it was mid march struck\nFirst Newfoundland from the eastern most parts of the country it's been moving across to great celebrations Chris O'Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation balls that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was selling the first batch\nIt's a company called

locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street by the candidate but for for now for the most part you'll be ordering it online it's controlled by the same corporation of government that control the sale of liquor\nHow those composing for film and TV compared with composing for more violent games\nAnd what goes into bringing ditch to world to life using signed\nOver

expecting the space age mixing days can futuristic audio systems but I wasn't expecting to see so many analog instruments\nI totally ... which is already quite intriguing several on a low key boards of beautiful we can find the roads or lets her [laughter]\nAfter getting settled with the cheating on the electric piano I asked Johan ... career began\nWell I actually started missing in Los Angeles Ninety to Ninety three and then I really focus on fuck this guy called cat gray with my teacher and mentor\nAnd he turned and play with prince and stuff like that and then I went to Berkeley in in Boston and I continue with the funk and so in a a lot of gospel as well\nBut before Johan move to America for studies he started a bond with these friends back home and Sweden cold the family tree\nWhile I was in Boston we've got a record deal so I ... at the you know just what I Want to do so I went out and we went on tour here in Sweden in India and your end when mark now just like Sweden Denmark or and then I got fed up\nOn tour in and started thinking ... how can I make a living being a musician\nBeing in a studio which is my favorite place on earth and a happy accident this guy and knew he reached out of the blue hey do you want to do some use it for computer game yeah [laughter] a\nLittle bit Johan knew that this introduction to the work of composing for computer games would lead to his music being heritage all over the world Candy Crush\nSaga is obviously a huge\nMassive yeah in fact I've got written down year one point seven billion downloads so far that's a lot of people that's a lot of people yeah so you're probably the most played composer from the world at the moment could be\nNot by choice though [laughter] I just happen to be there [laughter]

people the potential audience for ... work is many times thought a staggering number of people can access these music at the top of a screen and I\nCouldn't wait to hear more about his creative\nProcess but first I Want you to understand more about how Johan worked alongside the rest of the developing king king\nThe game has sometimes more than one producer that you know their main focus is to make sure it's a great game yeah\nWhen we talk about me recording in the city or whatever I'm the\nExecutive producer regarding the music the music itself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah who who all Timothy decides this is the music we're going to use well the one of the producers is my main contact that's the same procedure for every game and as soon as we establish some sort of\nHappiness if if I can you know if they're concerned with the material they're getting from me I always want to have the final say I always want to feel free so I say you're going to get something like this right but it's going to be better\nSo you basically they they all okay I'd direction and then you're free to yeah to go with it yeah I mean not very uh that's the law freedom\nIt is and I'm not sure that's like normal procedure but that's how I've done it and I haven't asked questions music such a difficult thing to talk about it or if\nYou're not a musician a year earlier juice or or the right to her and you meet some days\nThat you can create a language that they can both understand uh buy music yeah than your rocket really and that's what that's like really\nReally tough yes some producers game producers know some about music some have a big interest and are very interested in no you know they might even play guitar or something and no the vocabulary\nBut some have no clue whatsoever and I said send me a Spotify each linked to something similar your you know you're imagining my products going to sound like\nI joined us on a few days after you've received he's three for jelly saga and he was a ... to start in the first time he'd spoken to the game producer\nAnd he was looking for inspiration\nFor me starting off every job is a bit of a nightmare that blank sheets a blank page with nothing on I live in ... yeah surely you must at times\nSpend a day writing and never come up with anything I always hear the music in my head and I follow that thing that I hear\nSit back and you know listen to it\nAnd know that wasn't it ... reaching kind of get into not not not moved\nA lot can sometimes need to take a break just go out for a walk\nSo we just dont you on that I wouldn't for strolls\nSolar I quite a few people here I've noticed carrying I put some headphones and listening to things do you ever see that\nI listen to a lot you know at at home a lot when I turn on Syria [noise]\nTo to music uh normally in the car and on walks and that's a bicycle I normally indifferent to spoken word somehow right but I Am do or listen to certain composers or musicians to you know get inspiration I guess\nNot trying to steal anything or so but I like movies about this\nOne of my favorites yeah regarding the audience ration and yeah and stuff you find you go through phases of going listening to different people and getting going yeah yeah yeah I I get like yeah\nI get stuck with one person for a band or something and then I just listen to that matter person for three four months and then I'm sick of it and then I Move on yeah thanks yeah but then it goes in cycles so one of my you know the biggest [noise]\nIdol it's prince yeah he was a hard time Mozart sort of the biggest ...\nPrince had come up a few times in our conversation which wasn't a surprise considering ... study from the university and playing the genre with these ... to her and as I walked in the park continued it became clear important this background wars for finding inspiration\nThings pop up my head can be hit it on a on a wall could just be that there was something I just get my phone\nPush record on ah and normally I said some like a comment like come out that the the vows to San Diego to put a display that if that will do some shopping\nTough them more meaning adds some math oh Bowen and clarinet for something of foods that in the play something with interest is in in three what he called tough three or or\nThoughts thirds yeah yeah so yeah and I ... ... when I hear the music I hear more than I have like for how many ... and stuff so I but I can just saying one [laughter] I think the middle east and I you know make memos of what I hear\nSo you build up a catalog of these and then the ah the when you go to the studio in the morning you kind of listen back to the mall how'd you I always remind yourself ... of these things are come they have folders Google Drive\nLet's see if I can find I tend to raise a lot of stuff [noise] um [noise] has enough where this could be\nA mess of but it's not a British ... and the classmates theme string parts of the [noise]\nYou hunt was ready to start doing these dental and that's a ... next to him in the studio I noticed something that was very strange to me\nWhen I can pose I watched the moving image I get to field a performance and understand or the producers of the film or tea program when the audience to react you on was composing ... looking at any images he played a quick damage game when he's ... and I just started his work\nYeah [noise] um [noise] the [noise] one expert [laughter] [noise] I was\nA rare a I Would take the money [noise] [noise]\nRight [noise] so we're still getting together where you get more than three like some of the Bowery [noise] does he get\nThat yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nFinally there was one thing I'd be wanting to ask you one since I had to write something that I've been playing on my mind since I first found out I was heading into the studio with a minute ... music for some of the biggest ... games in the world if you press the mute button on the Internet would be I don't think you would enjoy it as much\nBut I music dialogue are starting to facts you'd struggle to understand the drama but you can ... Boston or new ones work I'm Still understand and enjoy the game\nSo having just played the game myself I we noticed that uh\nThat there's actually a mute button for the sign for the whole game but there's also a mute button just for the music so you get out of the the side effects I D I Do you feel about that do you feel about was\nNecessary for them to Putin was your idea no not at all [laughter] and I don't know how it came to be but I'm I understand if you're on a bus or something you don't want to know about other people so it's it's inevitably alone process\nFor all you know from conception to birth so to speak a\nGave hides a brief you ended up going to be the past you've recorded a orchestra you've recorded on Oprah choir so Lewis ... you'd makes several different versions of it you've done a hundred and fifty signed effects\nOn yet after all a lot people might still totally musicals how do you feel\n[noise] yeah I mean I'm I Can't do anything about it I'm fine with it but hearing you mean when you put it that way it feels like a ...\nTotally out of the music on and but I Would\nThink that anyway but ah yeah that's that's I put down some effort to it I guess and uh yeah I Would hope they appreciate the music [noise]\nDoesn't upset you that people will occasionally\nNo I mean it's their decision has their own\nLoss that experience as a whole is\nDeal and audio and they have the whole show that um\nBut I don't get upset I\nGet it presumably I mean people switch you off no not necessarily because you don't like music\nYeah ISIS within which they're playing the game yeah I think if\nI tell myself it it's sad but I\nSay I you know you have to be honest I mean if you play the game and I've I've\nGot so much nights you know nice comments from\nPeople from all over the world loving the missing and then that that really warms my heart but you got to be honest and if you have the same three minute three thirty whatever it is music and you play that game for let's say hundred throughout throughout three hundred hours or so\nYou will end up getting better at other there's no way avoiding it yet but you you know I I Try my best to\nMake you feel good as long as possible [noise]\nHappy to have the tools to deal with [noise]\nYou know I have to you know ... sometimes I entered this real this is my office [noise]\nAnd it's [noise]\nI like being here are still I like the freedom this job crates I mean I it's it's a ... as you know the very next and\nSometimes yeah I go out get creativity from nature or whatever\nAnd I feel I've you know I've got the opportunity to do that here or no one bothers me or complaints as long as I deliver\n'em some quite content I Hope that will stay here I could say for the rest of my life but as long as I work I Would love to be here\nI Can't imagine\nSomething better than this it's so creative and I get to do what I Love which is work with music [noise]\nBeen listening to you in the studio with Johan homes from\nI'm John London and this has been an audio always production by Chelsea Dickinson ...

Arab uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power veterans\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or soon as possible and then to upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is\nThere describe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in Airbus Boeing that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly look\nKnow providing aircraft some of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or Paris\nIf you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric powered trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types that grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model that's\nCorrect you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic check cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on there you you might have been also they have passed laws regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like

basically learning how to survive in the jungle we learned how to shoot there was only one way of getting me and that was killing animals and we were taught about fruits and plants we could eat\nThat

because we'd been mourned by a neighbor a group of around twelve men wearing civilian clothes arrived at his house asking for us pretending to be a friend\nThat neighbor became suspicious they had boots new clothes and were armed so he invited them to leave their will avoid spending the night in the jungle and he sent his son early next morning to buy coffee that boy came to us hit describe
