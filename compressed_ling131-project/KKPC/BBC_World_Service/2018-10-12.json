at times\nBut um you know just as much as we've gone down so far the turn it on can be quite quick also government should do and I think that they should be given an opportunity to actually show what they can do\nIn the meantime I've joined the cue of cars about a mile long waiting just cast pets are all here in Harare the news\nDo you remember the last time there was high fashion food shortages

what questions are being asked about out American run charge you set up to provide education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them wants to be abused instead\nThe more than me educational chance she was founded by an American living Katie ... who raise millions of dollars and was even renting a building by the then president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf like twenty four seeing how that number of golf had come forward and edging they had been raped by the organizations may coordinate kept Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison than little died of aids but the fact that the charge you will still able to operate to raise more funds despite do scandal ... people in Liberia\nOne man who took up distorting the year long investigation is really young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by ... ProPublica on time because it\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier\nIt was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and he was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often managing scholarship\nProgram last time went on the organization was\nThrough the the marketing ability of the founder kicked him either\nWas able to win the million dollars in a competition through Facebook which then meant that they could open up a bit on school but sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization student according to their statements that police\nHad been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as youngest ten when the rapes began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge you talk\nTo you know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh Johnson\nHow did the investigation and food\nBasically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it\nAnd it was known in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape\nBut a really no one has ever gone deep and to really find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened there was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls around it scare\nOr so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement that this was a community issue according to our investigation to minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... who doesn't intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had the power to him by giving him the power\nThrough the educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school\nAnd then when it came to light that you had been ripping these girls essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations owned and operated and cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access to abused young girl\nThe mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died of aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped locked infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the ten girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is it to students who are named lessons that can spot them by that tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate you know there'll be many changes of told to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually there it's been reported in which time two girls were it for the first time according to their statements to the police\nSo definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rapes came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in the six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time on the organizations founder and the organization overall\nWe're courted very strongly about international press subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months since these rapes in our organization coming to like a\nJournalist Finley young ... how's this treatment in June of ...\nGoals named John some of the abuse of both of the kinds of me under the community as soon as the fossil fuels reported off the new

planet we're trying to preserve the lives in chances of among the most vulnerable people as well because the most vulnerable populations those who are already poor\nOr or elderly or have more difficult circumstances will be the most affected the first affected so I think that that has to be your absolute priority and from that perspective economic cost is necessary it's not that it's it's just in an absolutely necessary investment\nNow of course they're all going to have to be very very big changes and we're hopefully going to talk about this quite a bit\nUm including the fact that we're talking about energy rejections so not just energy efficiency that reduction in total levels of energy demand\nEspecially in the interim because we've really lost his problem to too late we've really been delayed by all kinds of problems um such as a climate denial is and influences a big fuss allow these [noise]\nSo but we usually have reduction\nOf ... of of energy use you're talking about people getting out by causing walking all cycling or using public transport for\nAn absolutely absolutely and so especially in the interim we are talking about reducing our energy use considerably um however uh the research shows in my research and particularly I'm as well as others that energy consumption does not necessarily mean living standards so it is possible to have a perfectly good quality of life\nAnd have lower energy use but the infrastructure has to be there at the infrastructure has to be in place such as public transit ... cities that are safe to cycle and walk in there that are\nLower ideas on her don't do you think that people living in cities as they do now especially in the developed world are going to see it quite as positively is a\nWell in fact what we know that people in cities have\nGenerally lower carbon footprint when compared to people who don't even see the if I think just in my experience coming from Cambridge this morning I was biking behind Abbas and there was black smoke coming out of the bus I think that in you know it's easy to see particularly on these area called benefits from changing most of transportation what\nSome of the state today benefits are from reducing things like oil consumption\nBut in terms of the ordinary people and you say to them if someone who drive to work every day holiday going to feel about getting out of that call and trying to use public transport it's a tough off\nCertainly I think ah even though we have a short period of time um\nI Would argue that we need a combination of\nTop down leadership in terms of what leaders that they see the level that the regional level and at the national level do and we also need lots of my campaign send movements that try to convey some of these cold benefits of changing the way in which we work but I think that you're right that the notion that\nFrom one day to the other we're going to get people in London to completely change the way they go to work for example or in other places\nAnd enough instance London's about example because actually they release in ... the public transport infrastructure in place there are many other cities where it simply doesn't exist\nIndeed so we have these long timescales that are required to putting the infrastructure as you are yeah and uh and Julia mentioned um but we need to get started today so I think the fact that this is hard ah precisely me is that we need to get started today with these both top down and bought them up\n... says so far we've had from people who are thinking about this in an academic way if you like you've got to try and sell this to the public isn't it like ... to the Christmas\nBut I really don't agree I mean I think of getting people to get a Cohen still sitting in a traffic jam is that she couldn't appealing us going if lots of people go to the cause and we're on the bus that wouldn't be the traffic down so everybody get to it folks to suit you know the private ... not the answer to freedom all happiness and if you sit on the bus then you go look for people to ... way struggle\nBecause that's the reason that there are plenty of people who do see that individual is being in the car or something they value very highly\nOf I think a lot of people actually enjoy public transport when it was well if we think about young people know lifted the ma choosing not to drive particularly if they live in cities where the public children's books good so it's I think the others have said it's more important that you have good public ...\nSo you give people a real choice to make I didn't think anybody really enjoys the moon and commute switching for two hours in a lot of traffic and he said the same about having to commute to work you know why do people\nLive so far from where they what we can change systems have mobile home working people working full day week so they have moved on relationships the kinds of things that make them happy because the way the economy's working at the moment is actually creating a mental health crisis as well as an energy crisis so you know we can rethink those systems and people will be actually much happier\nFootball this is a very particular view of of the world and how we might want to live in it but let's take another example think of an aviation people love flying the gig on holidays the traveling for all kinds of reasons howling us would something like aviation fish in to a much greener well\nWell the um new climate economy which is a reporter was published in September and lays out a way of a restructuring the global economy in the way that allows us great for freedom and greater opportunity for a a more sustainable growth model\nBut we have at the moment about there are going to be in many of these places like the power system we know more or less how to do it there are going to be some different more difficult problems\nSo cool part to it by sectors including things like shipping aviation\nSome forms of manufacturing for to steal but there's great technological development going on the\nThe crossing our fingers and it said ...\n... people were working on this all across the world and moved development going on there's a report you out of the end of November Barbie energy transition commission which will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development ... technology is not happening so quickly\nThere is a prospect of short flights being possible using ... from Port same wave law a long distance trucking you won't\nBe easy not slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to and you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is ... it's going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine no everybody but people do\nI think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging TV is one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the same fall we just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable lives how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards and the likes of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better call legalize they don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's both lowering our missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand\nFive to seven and ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term clause doesn't equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra ... prices seem that you cannot another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people are larger share of their\nIncome is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no Lewis says what we can say that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training with a emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think\nThere's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you about it for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC as an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nEverybody will have to move the money out of fossil fuels and tools a sustainable future instead so there's a lot of power we have politically over the economy and we need to use that to shift probably just investments\nGiven given the kind of levels of of votes that policies like you'll get do you think there is public awareness public support for those kinds of policies\nWith in terms of sustainable fun I'm Sorry what Jonah report here in the parliament and it was supposed to cross you know really took us to the right wing\nOf the people who were elected but I didn't think this is an issue that's not exclusively the the ownership of one policy will politicians are focused on this and that's how I managed to build a strong position really to support an important and powerful position on sustainable finance\nSo let's try and understand the practicalities for a moment before we returned to the politics when we look at renewables are we working towards having enough renewable to power our ... our needs by themselves billboard\nWell in the u._k. friends since we've been making a very big switch\nTo a low carbon forms of power generation particularly drive in coal off the system\nSo what's happened since Ninety nine to use or do you have managed to reduce its annual emissions of greenhouse gases by moving forty percent of its economy is growing by more than Seventy percent third has demonstrated that tackling climate change does not mean you have to sacrifice economic growth\nIt ... with a relatively modest\nCarbon price and wise investments in the development of renewables managed to drive coal almost completely out of its power generation system others said itself I conservatives talk give I think of getting cold down to zero by twenty twenty five\nOr does mean investments out front but in many places the price of renewables per unit just bring coming down far quicker even but most economists hold on to ... and then in many parts of the world it is now cheaper\nTo gain electricity off from renewables even in places like Texas they have discovered the wind and solar is far cheaper than relying on coal or gas or\nThe other forces Judy assigned beg lots of good news that say renewables are going up but all they reliable enough and is there a place that nuclear power and all of this\nBefore we talk about nuclear I think that we need to talk to you need to talk about two different things one issue is that renewables happened growing and the cost has been coming down and this is good news however they've not been driving fossil fuel is off the grid\nAnd and the case of the u._k. maybe we're not using coal as much but just this week the government has given the go ahead to drill for fracking at the press to new roadside which is very close to Manchester why live the local community has been up in arms against it\nAnd the local authority trying to not allow the planting site and the central government forced them to accept the fracking on their location so very anti democratic decision\nAnd three protesters were recently sentenced to jail time we do have a mixed picture and I think that we know we we need to focus our efforts not just\nOn developing renewables and driving their price down and incentivizing renewable production but we actually do need to shut down fossil fuel extraction and development\nAnd the other two separate efforts I don't think that we can count on cheap renewables it's too much to ask of cheap renewables to drive fossil fuels off the grid that's something that's a political decision that has to be taking little lord another another level and Laura de\nAs an adult we were in Norway last week where they openly admitted that they may have a great sort of hydro electricity system themselves one of the reasons they were able to do all of this was off the back of the sales of the oil and increasing the gas\nWell I think as Julie saying we need action across all areas and they see the one thing I report talks about energy talks about land use talks about CDs and talks about industry\nAnd it's true that renewables like themselves cannot do everything it's of course easier to make these investments if there's a surplus however I must say that Norway is actually more some some um an outlier in the sense that it has been wise enough to sink\nIn a long term way about all these revenues not all countries\nThat have um I'm a raw materials and other resources um have been doing it um I think um\nWe need to you know you you mentioned um retail at the beginning um that the summary or if our previous conversation was that the one point five he's perfectly do uh well I Would like to kind of\nReal easy to just the the optimism that they ...\nThey should not be miserable but I think is really important to note that he's extremely hard that we need all the options that we need action from all sectors we need to find those community would need a policy community at all levels are ... and we need um they they National Community so we really need everything and I think\nThat is an enormous challenges in it and I were going to talk about politics in the moment but if you talk about the north south divide within the world if you talk about the divisions between America and China I mean there were so many stumbling blocks to achieve what you're describing\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that he is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or a four different policies\nMoly I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power not ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now\nDo offshore wind about forty five dollars and make it ... and make it was ... I think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little town and that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrifying of energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new those\nSo uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them want things from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they being instructed to serve the can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's as in David ... they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this the last\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've used a science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that the warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide your date and of course that's true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from power if there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I wanted to say\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states the ... the United states is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and which is the odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nSome of these challenges with us and I think ah well this is because democracies are very good benefits today costs in the future and in fact here we have a lot of class today and kind of more future benefits but I think we can highlight in particular policy actions that the local level that the region level at the national level\nFrom the perspective of these benefits that we will have today or in the short term and we talked about some of these health benefits\nThere is some of the call benefits that we can talk about some of them might be health so much that it might be jobs\nAnd let me bring joy that back in ... we talking about benefits in the future\nIn developed countries people don't like having stuff taken away from them they don't want to know that they don't want to hear that they can't buy more clothes all and you call in a country like India where people are aspiring to those things are aspiring to the refrigerator they moved to bike and perhaps the call how honesty persuade them to say you know will you didn't want that stuff\nBasically people want to have a good life\nBut they don't necessarily want to have throwaways things that you throw away every day so if you just take the case of plastics\nThem onto plastics me throw we consume huge amounts of fossil fuels as well as energy\nSo the question is how do they use\nThe existing culture in different countries in the world to try to focus more on quality rather than quantity so it's not as if you want to really say that you should buy less\nBut why can't you buy better quality very poor person in the air is that even really an option no but to put up a lot less than he has the right of course to improve his life all her life\nAnd I think the question is much more about the rich the question of inequality was brought up we know that you know one percent of the world's population seems to have as much as the remaining Ninety nine percent and that's also true for India do you need much more equality within the Indian society as well and more sharing of\nThe wealth I went to a feature view a final question all begin with you you're in ten years time if we're going to follow those recommendations and the reports the findings the report we would need to be well on our way to reduce ... emissions so do you believe given what we know now about a\nPops will stay on the United states global attitudes that globally we will have achieved that that we will be on our way\nThrough just reports was reading off for by the governments and mobile feeding to political pro says at the end of year and over the coming years governments who have all these scientific evidence and sit around a table so I really do hope that governments\nTake into account the scientific evidence and put the rope on the tractor worth reducing global emissions Laura in ten years time\nI think if we have countries that put in place you know the politically viable second best policies to create coalitions of winners that reduce the costs to search that invest in innovation at that emphasize nickel benefits maybe [laughter]\nI was\nI don't think we have any choice but to believe retirement because we will tons of it is we just gave up and then it's all do so on\nOne doesn't want to be overly optimistic about it more people have to engage with politicians and say to them we want to choose the future we have because the future not to for the people here and now\nIt's a kind of well we want to leave talk children or grandchildren I think most people won't the well to be a better place for the children grandchildren they currently have\nJoined the group the court cases in India and in the U.S by young children are asking that governments there doing enough\nSo I think that when you see a whole sees all four cases where people who've tried to put pressure on that governments need much more leadership policy entrepreneurs in social movements to get this going to be desperately need the help of the gym and his\nJudith ... I\nWould agree to that and I think we can't wait for ten years I think that every decision we make and every anybody who's listening to this trying to think about how you can form a neighborhood group to talk to your friends your neighbors making meeting with your local and he\nWe need to get moving every single decision we make every single hour we spend every single piece of information we can bring into schools and bring up for debate this is something that's going to take all of us and it's going to take all the effort we have\nTo keep the number of to be honest dead people as low as possible\nAnd ...\nWhen I think I Am bringing good news really from Brussels because we need to do more we've made very strong progress in terms of industry and an energy systems when I was working on

that these nerves do have other issues over in Asia for instance ten cent was planning on having an IP oh an initial public offering of its music division was looking to raise two billion dollars

you\nUsed it from the BBC olive 'cause you just kind of show would you let's go to live there now but questions are being asked about how an American Ron Charles you set up to provide education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused as Ted\nYeah than more than me educational charity was founded by an American ... who raised millions of dollars and it was even gone to a building or by the then president and John ... says leaf my twenty fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and edging they had been raped mighty organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charity will still able to operate unreasonable funds despite the scandal on good people in Liberia now one month took up the story you know you long investigation on Tuesday was really\nYoung he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by pro public uh and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often and managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements the police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the rapes began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care or so when the rates came to light\nThe organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... station had an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating\nCultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access to abuse young girl\nThey mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named lessons victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate just generally there'll be an any changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place it's definitely true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time to Charles where it for the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely the organization type the policies but\nWhether it's western black woman or whether it's nature and black women there is little to no visibility of eating disorders and black women are facing um sources and challenges that\nPerhaps either white women are not facing or that they've already overcome just because the history of them having eating disorders is so much older [noise]\nI received an email this week which brings high and why all this rain a masters\nIn our last episode we talked about the rise of eating disorders in China\nAnd to listen to in the U.S he's nice died from Bolivia right if I can be bold your program featured people he survived that reaching disorders that the lucky ones the ones who don't survive leave behind families who are heartbreaking and confused [noise]\nEating disorders which includes ... anorexia nervosa and binge eating disorder and mental illnesses which severely to stab to pass and eating behaviors\nAnorexia has the highest mortality rates the old defined psychological illnesses\nAnd while teaching disorders will once thought to be a problem experienced I only by women and high income countries after the ... studies have shown they affect women and men who is of the world and they rise with economic development\nHere's the thing the women were about to hear from will say the stereotype that eating disorders or rich white west and women's problem still widely prevails\nDealt all say tell me that when eating disorders in that community is already known etched the plane is often placed on westernized nation in particular as if the seeds of West and beauty ideals and that to them doesn't always mean trade [noise]\n\n... is twenty six year old writes a book that base in Japan is back in South Africa histories thoughts five years ago but not with a desire to be thin\n[noise]\nUm [noise] so I mean there was some traumas but um I had been\nThrough um\nUh just violations um you know again my buddy as a woman um that was a very confusing time [noise] um I\nDidn't speak out about it that's the point in my life and so you know I guess as a result of that I\nJust went into this depression it was a lot that I did not understand or even know about depression or even an eating disorder those were foreign I'm fern subjects something that you know a stereotypically why people went through\n... can you explain your feelings about food at that time\nThe word I use is it ... me\nI'm\nThe smell of food would make me very sick it would make me anxious actually you know you're taught that it's a if you're a visiting someone's house and uh you did not finish your food you're being groomed\nSo that was something that was super super hot for me to deal with because of the harsh criticism or\nTeasing that I Would get it because I haven't touched my food so I guess it's abnormal for a black person to not wants to eat well it's not like food um it was a very strange thing for people to see\nWas any of this about your boss the weight with any of this about wanting to be thin\nThere was never a point where I wanted to be a you know skinny or an ideal body type there was never a point where um you know flipping through a magazine and saying oh I Want to be\nThat size or I Want that buddy I've always been comfortable with my buddy I'm my buddy issues a self image issues only came about after I lost all the way it's because I felt that I looked horrible couldn't\nQuite handle the comments 'em and body shaming comments that were being paused about how skinny I was or how unhealthy I was looking I didn't see my family for very long time you know there's just a grand sense of shame that comes with that as well\nYou know my mum would ask me what is wrong and I could never explain it as a result I just felt to keep to myself\nHow did you ever met anyone with an eating disorder\n[noise] no I never\nHad you ever had of about South Africa with an eating disorder\nHow different she think things would have been for you if that was more awareness about eating disorders in South Africa and particularly about black women having eating disorders\nIf I had known you know the eating disorder existed then I Would have been able to get help\nIt wasn't until ... went to see a therapist that she realized ... illness was an eating disorder she told me having a name for it gave her a huge sense of relief and with the support a family and friends she began to recover\nBut she says she didn't continue to see a therapist an older white women\nThere's a lot of complexity to being black and of course a lot of complexity to being watched as well but the experiences because of the history of this country of segregation of about the age\nOf separate developments it means that the reality is distinctly different so a problem that I might suppose to an older white women from another generation she is not open to all the possibilities little mother the reality of\nMine lived experience they will give me watch solutions for my block problems\nWhat which good treatment of looked like what did you need to do you think\nUm I definitely think if I had spoken to a black female therapists she would have been more helpful to my um situation continues found a black female therapist or I think they do exist yes but they ought to come by\nI did find that kind of a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders but cycle just feeling it might be hard to find many more [noise]\nYou know if there are many black psychologists specialize in eating disorders across South Africa\n[noise] unless they are not really I don't I don't I don't have a good sense of how many they would be out there and there's quite a few moments where we've having us less anyone else\nWell India in [laughter] new one Indian psychologist have you ever met any other psychologists he specializing in eating disorders and so I'm going to\nKnow do you think it's important that black South Africans with eating disorders can speak to black psychologist\n[noise] what do we know about

therapist\nAnd then they hold on a cosign a wax into public psychiatric hospital in Johannesburg which has the only state funded inpatient eating disorder unit in South Africa\nShe told me that well the fast cases of eating disorders amongst black South African women with documented in the Nineteen nineties that hasn't seen enough for such since then ... on the scale of the problem will die\nThat is definitely a sense um that it it is increasing the exposure to western culture is something that seems to influence the likelihood of one developing an eating disorder\nWe seeing especially in the younger population who live in the ... it's an area is going to make schools that the name to associated eating disorders thinking so a lot of concern around rate in shape losing weight\nIs visiting the pro anorexic would believe me quit sides so that waste and culture influence is seeming to to be one of the biggest contributors and the prevalence of eating disorders and blood in the black population\nThe teaching disorders on just about being saying all by some of the people respect and to on this program has been really came to emphasize that that is not what tree and let me sing to soda\nYeah so it's not just about being send those different elements a lot of patients will talk about different things around trying to control what feels extending like a very chaotic outside world being able to live independently without other relationships because people disappoint you and hurt you\nSo there's different sort of narratives behind what away the eating disorder might have stemmed from but I think Disney pie the pro sin pro\nUm fitness kind of message that's communicated can tend to exist debate those already existing problems so I think that's one factor that has been researched unfortunately there's not a lot of research into Africa around eating disorders [noise]\nFull in LA westernized nation is a major factor in the rye for these disorders amongst the population [noise]\nShe can front of me and rather than talk about my eating disorder I started talking about my childhood rape\nLike that was less provocative and upsetting and and\nUnless I was that made me feel less vulnerable than talking about my eating disorder you know I always I always heard things like well you know black women don't have eating disorders black women are incredibly comfortable with with being large black women or\nYou know so I just felt like I was failing all the way around failing at ... at being the archetype strong black woman [noise]\nSay Stephanie suffered

I thought\nAnd it said it if you have an eating disorder we can help you and I just remember clutching onto this magazine and thinking this has to be the answer [noise]\nAnd so I went to this guinea pig program it was at one of the hot larger hospitals and I felt like a freak people were just staring at me and [noise]\nYou know because what I've since learned is that women of color don't tend to come forward and\nYou know it just didn't work I felt it was another experience where I just felt isolated I felt like the only black woman in the world who didn't know how to eat\nEventually Stephanie fan to support program which ... but she says accepting help didn't come easily\nI come from a very proud very proud community who like to keep our secrets and our issues to ourselves\nIt's it's like you don't share what's happening in your household with the outside world and and you certainly don't share it with white people you know that's kind of a betrayal and so you learn how to cope on your own\nI always say why are we went to the only communities that have to struggle in silence that have to\nYou know suffer as if it's some badge of courage\nWet does this add to cheat to mental health come from do you think it's\nJust like a holdover from slavery it's like you're going to go out into the world and trust white people you know when you look at these these people of color who have trusted the system and and been burned I think it's well deserved this lack of trust she thinks\nThe eastern suited still seen as a white women's problem what do you think that things have changed eating\nDisorders are seen as a white women's problem they're seen as a gateway to wanting to be white they're seen as black women who want to be mainstream or who want to be skinny they're not seen as a mental health issue they're not seen\nAs a coping mechanism and I thought if I wrote a book and helped one person understand all people men and women who deal with stress may develop an unhealthy relationship with food so I wrote my book\nThe response was not what I expected what I found an initially was it was\nA lesbian women why poor women all kinds of ethnic women but it took a while for the black community to kind of embrace me in the same way I'm One of those that do you think\nYou know it's it's a shameful thing we don't want to talk about the molester uncle we don't want to talk about\nThings in our community that don't bring us pride like we still have one or two or three black women speaking for the entire community and that is problematical except somebody has to speak why they're so few women speaking\nI I mean it's certainly not sexy right like like like yeah I'm going to talk about throwing up like ... you know you kinda lose all your oh you're black girl magic when that's where your your conversation it's just less people are less interested\n[noise] [noise]\nShould be listening to the piano ...\nStephanie it's clear that to see eating disorders as a problem and the time the facts whites winning and western countries can prevent the women and men who suffer from\nThese potentially fatal illnesses from finding the support they need [noise]\nIf you've seen affected by she's in this program did he tell website WWW dot BBC don't see I thought you pay for what's fashion the chain and you'll find some links to information and support [noise] and that's just not what you think about a six pack on on social media using the hash tag BBC\nThe chain for now for me anytime is an editor ... thanks and his name and join us again for the fate chain next week\n\nThis is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for Mohammed insolvent\nIn a moment we'll speak to the reporter who spent Eighteen months researching the story a story President Trump's lawyer has cooled folks and defamatory\nBut first in another age an investigation like this had the power to bring down a politician even a whole government on Twitter President Trump himself but he gave it to the tension that was just a single tweet and what she called it\nQuote boring but what about American voters\nHis view from a town in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump San Antonio in Texas\nThe New York times is regularly putting out I think incorrect information so my first inclination is to just not believe anything I say\nAnd do you think that's like an opinion that a lot of friends neighbors amateur yesterday what if the allegations straight up and then\nI Would want to look into it and I'd reconsider and you know maybe changed my mind but so far the New York times has been zero for zero I already had a very\nLow opinion of Trump and I still have a low opinion of Trump bend the article I I feel like he he is just like he can do\nWhatever he wants an article don't matter it wouldn't change my opinion of him if someone's on the fence about Trump at this point I'm not sure that this investigation of change and I mean there's probably enough information up there for you to make up your mind a one way or the other\nSo nah nope all that crazy\nIt is one of the New York times journalist who spent the last year and a half of their lives delving into the details of President Trump and his family's tax if as to how much would she put into it\nWhen was it now was march of two thousand and Seventeen Eighteen months ago and Rachel Maddow who has a talk show in the United states\nShe had three pages of Donald Trump's two thousand and five tax returns and what was striking to us was that he had actually made a hundred and thirty odd million dollars in two thousand five\nWe were just shocked and so the next morning started this odyssey of digging into his finances\nThat ended up with the story that we ran\nAnd it's an incredibly detailed story fourteen thousand would article was it difficult to take that deep I mean how would they know to get the feuds get the documents you needed\nIt was like having a million puzzle pieces thrown into the middle of the times square and being asked to put them back together we started out trying to figure out that really simple question and it led us to Fred Trump Donald Trump's father who died in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd four or five years later the Trump children's sold Fred Trump's empire and it was a massive sale that went through very quietly to another real estate developer in New York\nAnd not let us to just think wow like Fred Trump had a lot more money\nThan we've been thinking through public documents\nWe were able to piece together how Fred Trump starting when Donald Trump was just three started establishing trust for his children so he'd made them his landlords he sort of putting land and to trust that Donald Trump bone and then he would be paying Donald in his siblings rent\nAnd then we started making calls and we were just incredibly fortunate where we had sources who\nGave us access to ... and thousands of pages of confidential financial data including two hundred separate tax returns\nAnd the results you know that you've written is really forensic is there a reason why you went into that amount of detail\nWe felt given the allegation that we're accusing sitting president of tax fraud that we owed it to our readers to document that as well as we could\nGo out and she said that the accusation is so serious you have to be forensic and what you're saying\nYeah the New York times to accuse the sitting president of multiple kids was a tax fraud has never happened and it's incredibly serious what all the legal consequences you think now for the president\nI Know that the city in the state or looking at now various taxes that could be owed both on a city and state level\nSome of it for criminal liability has passed the statute of limitations but there could still be civil fines coming the Internal Revenue service could also open it you have to remember now that the person ultimately in charge of the IRS as Donald Trump that I'm sure as a challenge\nThere should be a right and wrong and all of this and if they did something wrong I Hope somebody is able to show it in a way that results in at least ... taxes being paid on the money that they do\nDo you think that Iraq school will change anyone's opinion about Trump in terms of his support base\nI don't know I mean I [noise]\nI sort of try not to write into a political ends or think that way I think what it does is it sets the record straight the Donald Trump got a lot more from his father than you knew you said so many times you know what I'm self made billionaire and my father mainly gave me moral support\nThat line was repeated so often that it has just been repeated as fact\nBut we were able to pin down that it was at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars that was transferred\nBut at the New York times you quote used to say that because the White House is so antagonistic when it comes to the New York times that that that sort of a U.S default response is to be well they hate the president that they will write this kind of stuff yeah I don't want to be\n... wouldn't say that it's not political because we're we're writing into a political world but it's just not what we do Washington is going to say what they're going to say and and\nThat's their job so I just sort of try to figure out on our and how we can ... get stories to publication that we're proud of them that are right now\nHe's on Craig narrow the New York times for some the absence of a political fool out to the New York times story underlines just how much the will to finance media and politics have changed in the past decade\nJohn Otis has just started a new job as senior editor at the financial news that his Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about financing markets for the Financial Times newspaper\nHe wrote a swan song off school for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media immune response to the New York times story ... is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the media in the most important institutions that go up the economy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that cleanly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was brought on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind in those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have ... basic sense that everybody's in it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that\nNobody is behaving well anyway [noise]\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an on preparedness to believe actual empirical facts lots of ... possibly does come from the rise of social means yet but there is\nA sense now that there's no particular reason to believe\nThe established means you're over ... that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation mall to be trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't he wasn't even brothers collapsed is actually that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about and you'll swan song for the F T\nYes\nI had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the humans had office it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in my city park a car because I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left him uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me wondering the same thing that they were losing money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible protected by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people in\nSmall suits trying to shuffle their money around to protect it\nNow that looked like a bank run technically wasn't they weren't actually taking them on the outs with them but it looks like a bank run and if we hit strides publicizing this it would've been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was\nIf we publicize an image like this then we're going to get in trouble because this is going to look irresponsible it's going to look for so we're in fighting panic\nA banker on basically inciting a bank run\nYes exactly which is one of the things you grow up to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can you get into trouble if there's a lot of confidence in that you've got to be really really sure of what you're doing before you see that there's a bank run\nSaid just because you didn't report it at the time\nI Do not report that the climate didn't particularly the recipients me to say\nOn ten years on because we have the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting I'm excited to talk about an ... by the sheer level of invective and the anger vis a rose opinion against the ... you know at least false one five to one against\nI

these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal infect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for palm that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapt the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense or vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics and\nThis is happening this protest is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... ... loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever

development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria these sub lethal effects on bacteria\nPresently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into possibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufactured chemicals\nOr those sorts of ... he he's a correspondent for the independent newspaper covering the middle east from Houston Bowl I asked both do first of all of the story of ...
