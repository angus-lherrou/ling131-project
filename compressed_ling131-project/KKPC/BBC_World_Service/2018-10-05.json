correspondent ... et cetera thank you for speaking to us I'm just remind us if you would have some of the allegations\nWhile the allegations are coming from three sides against Russia has said from the Netherlands for the u._k.\nAnd for the U.S and what they amount to say a huge a case against Russia that it's been involved in cyber attacks on many fronts\nOr in particular in the Hague and it was a huge wealth of evidence presented all staff and attempt to attack the ah to hack the wife ... system of the organization\nOr for the prevention of chemical weapons and that was a an and and this is an attack for which for a Russian agent so that agents of military intelligence were expelled from the country because they were traveling\nOn diplomatic passport south as you said Russia's response has been to dismiss all the claims and that's been a pretty brown dismissal on all sides sites or the foreign ministry here for example is accusing the west of a stage manage propaganda campaign against Moscow\nAnd it saying that the west is paranoid it fit Keesing Russia is accusing the west of buying mania and saying that anyone with\nA mobile phone is now being accused of being a spy already playing down or the the case against Russia and and playing down particularly the evidence so that we know for a fact that some of the evidence for example presented in the Hague about these Russian a man accused of attempted attack\nA we know that to to if the men with ... and then I'll sit in the links to a military sites here in Moscow and also the taxi receipt that was presented as evidence one of them and took a taxi from a military facility to the apple a couple of days ahead of the attack\nI've called the taxi company they've told me that is a genuine receipts it was one of the drivers who made the trip ... and there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of not receive so suggests a quite a quite extraordinary a seal the level of work by these Russian and that's fine\nAnd the idea of the slump the uh the fluffy were from the spies I mean will it to the Russians are generally fairly proud of their intelligence services are they getting a sense is there a feeling that maybe a that go I haven't been up to the their usual standards\nWell not if you want to state media nuts if you were if you read the pro Kremlin per se what really up playing on the evidence and very very heavily into saying in all of this is still on a few photos in a taxi receipts and sort of there's a lot of bluster and the state media\nAre until campuses I say paranoia and or anti Russian Campaign to know the like but if you read social media yes that's being\nUm but that's one of the questions that everyone is asking a but again as you rightly say we've seen the

we're facing now these are they a lot of a a must see about refugees about them moving from the youngest one regions to you the um Franklin Franco from the regents which is a French speaking region\nA

there is a huge divide between the the opposition parties became self ...\nOn the cause I'm younger from crisis as well has been one of the key factors which has a pool they might look it's a ... uh the the the the um for for example someone like occurring when that comes up and say some he's going to resolve the problem a immediately if he becomes president but that is the view of\nYou know of many of the ... a political parties so I think there is a huge a crusade by come in to believe that um if anyone has to you you know I'll I'll play you remove the president from power through the through the ... they they have to form a coalition but\nYou know the president already has a coalition and I I don't see 'em he lose any of these elections\nThat that's the that's the politics of it what about the election itself do you believe it will be free and fair\nOf course not so they'll actually stuff he's one of the key areas where a lot of people who have raised concerns um ... which is supposed to be\nOn an independent bow they said that he actually yeah of course the ... election ... was set up in two thousand and six\nI'm supposed to organize money ... unsupervised election\nA bit

well because it's right now I think it's important that we have to realize that we're not on track towards reaching that that targets\nAnd also that we don't have any significant plan that's Abed his hair mentioned it to how to reduce our climate gas emissions in Norway it's important to understand that the climate policy in Norway over the past Twenty years has been mainly policy on how to reduce crime is catching the admissions abroad\nAnd a lot of work that we've been doing now that like saving the rain forest it's been great but it's also in a way to sort of postpone the transition that we need to do in Norway and postponed is really tough choice is and how to reduce our climate gets missions\nCan Goodman send to the public in a sense being sold a bit of a a green wash us a puppet note that green after all\nI Will disagree or to cost care about that we don't have a plan I mean seriously we have debated a plan in the parliament and uh we have also a reduction of a seal tool in the atmosphere we have ah as I told a fifty percent electric cars that's\nA part of the plan of the taxes for cars I mean we haven't Ciro Texas if you buy a electric car but if you buy a car with the fossil fuel is full taxes\nSo for example does is active policy\nAnd we have to also take into account that this is a global issue so some of the export of oil and gas is also part of the world so do you have to shut down the coal plants they are more pollution ing and making this a problem or not I mean Norwegian gas can be part of the solution\nBecause no region gases clean out but if you think about ... new way could do given that it is well see what shifted to what more can it do I guess I should know way innocence be able to make more choices because of the wealth to enjoy so\nWe have to do a left at the same time on many different levels and if anyone tells you this is a magical buttons you can do one thing and then it will be solved that's not true because there's a lot of things to do you have to do energy efficiency you have to do more renewables you have to\nReplace coal would gas like in the u._k. they could produce energy for the first twenty four hours last year without the lump of coal because of the region guess that was disillusioned for them\nAnd of course it's not the solution forever but it is a solution on the way it will take time it will take decades\nBut we're going in the right direction and we have to go on the path that\nI don't really think we're going to the right direction they discuss that oil and gas policy it's because we continue with this this is your shoulders to political consensus amongst the biggest part is that we will maintain high production levels and we actually subsidize the expiration and uh\nThe longer we continue with the businesses to show the harder it will need\nTo go and get a wave a magic wand and put you in charge you said there isn't a plan what should the ...\nWell I think we should start taking part of the national debates about how much more oil and gas that can put into the atmosphere because if they burn all the research they know about now it reaches almost three degrees so everyone needs to take responsibility here and I think the challenge for the government and for the oil industry to\nFirst of all run the company in a way to the benefits\nOf ah the owners which is the states with a ... and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that many of the plan for how we can get off\nFor that I feel is is I think there is a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience with oil that uh the public sector for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north sixty percent totally in our life that we don't want to open the most vulnerable areas in the north that are flippant areas\nAnd are they also have pulled showing that people are willing to the oil in the ground for climate reasons thank goodness\nI think we're missing a major part of the energy world energy a debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out into ... look to China for example and uh the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders so we have to look on a on a great to scale and I mean that's\nSince no wage an oil and gas is one of the most screaming once produced in the world well enough to come through such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because specific\nPoint that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat said the ... is very important environmental area and then all of us have no way could be opened up to ... really important to marine life important but it's not something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps to the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very uh special area on the whole Silicon Valley as far so do you think your tipping point as far as public\nOpinions consent no I mean it's the courts are easy now because we have a a political from other government where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country that because uh\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe green ... the new region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nThis because he is not to view the shed by much the new region public that actually ... dust is we do it well it's\nSay polluting when the power comes from no way we take it out candy from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing fulfill your in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the right person it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum ... as far as you\nCan sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it in places like the ... seats in the up\nTo I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we actually have it and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate guessing mission can Goodman says\nWell I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal into work\nBut I don't know oh yeah we're talking about oh yeah but\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants with for example gas or even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... when I was next fenced in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt will thing Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get our fault that feels good sunny stuff\nAnd at the same time\n... the value of this country's exports have good comes from oil and gas I left a lot ... who's noise environment minister if\nThe country's green credentials tarnished by the fact that they make an awful lot of money from exposing fulfill feels\nThe need to be in front and taken into use the zero emissions solutions that are doing with the transportation sector I mean you know sending more electric cars than anywhere else last month and it was a close to fifty percent of the five but at the same time\nYou know the oil and gas industry will become a smaller part or economy in the future so we must also have a policy for having a green shift\nWe've been ... looking at the hydroelectric power plant that\nThis is part of this project that led to a new way being dumped the green battery of Europe the idea that this country can store power that's generated elsewhere in Europe and then send it back when supply from other sources tricky unpredictable renewable slumped how realistic is that\nIt is realistic for us that's a hobby to argue power here an oath of wind power to the park and with the European system so we are building into conductors Baltimore's Germany ... England so let's we've become part of it is our resources are large enough\nTo become the battery for Europe I think that is Martha realistic only this summer to have the drought we'll be old from needed to import electricity from the ... this is really into connected the power will flow both ways\nDo you think the way in which no way has written if you'd like to who is you've convinced public opinion that is is a good thing to keep this oil and gas industry it's bringing in a lot of money but at the same time you've managed to convince people that switching to hydroelectric power is a good thing where a green country we care about the environment\nHow long do you think you can maintain that writing those two very different horses\nWe are in the ... and that is not all male study is for the world the reads the Paris Agreement goals with how to make major changes to the next four eight twelve years so we really have to do carbon us the U.S marshals whose ideas we kind of soft us we can\nBut it's not really see that that isn't being challenged as it\nIt is a strategy for lowering emissions but it's also a strategy for a social change on an economic change is\nMultiple their moral question is really about the heart policy so how do we deal with climate change at the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness also in the future\n[noise] that the environment and his ... LVS too and he's in a hurry can fly on here\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to how to toss into had at the same time I don't think it's ... I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not try it out of all them\nVery interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable is get together at stops in filled all in the southwest it goes all the way to the northeast of England and it's going to allow new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs this in a sense done ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've level about his role as a fossil fuel ...\nMay be I think it's really good for us that we are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can\nActually develop more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make as much here as you can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that the I've been thinking about energy\nWe haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen that oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that we have to think about the way the use of energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that actually if we want to be part of the Europeans illusion than actually making more renewable energy it could be one of the answers to where we could put our money instead of the\n... yet gay and when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople are worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas to do the ... they're worried that the costs that they're going to pay it can it go up which suggests that people in Norway adjusted worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to save the world\nOf course they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to use your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline that has given us a lot of energy and different forms over a lot of years\nAnd that has made it possible but remember we're not building you hydro power and no way we have a lot of discussions above Wynwood parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there\nSo it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern to huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're exported to power or you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's a discussion about your work about where you live you go to do it's a problem\nIs I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outsider called ... which is very beautiful and it has a lot of the if the production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local energy company or are the rich now and we're actually looking at it together with the communities and the company is how we don't have to put another long cable to supply them but\nFor a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy futures is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing back new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable nuts to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's so much to developments in then reached an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so I'm sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all them in order to Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather study of renewable energy at our university which accounts\nFor other than oil actually had developed a new we have established in the renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan cause ... fault no love this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have money I don't think I think you've made it out there I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that ... and ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that ... the speeds\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nProbably have less oil and gas impact in the economy because you have to have to change\nRan shift is coming I think than technology will have developed so much that it will be going in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so a bit of ... about the role at technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy\nTiny as well I think production is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas so I think if it's going to happen by itself that people even though the projections that it will keep going until at least twenty she will be some some increase that's not the protections I Would say if you look at the\nExpected production of oil and gas and Norway\nIs that it's filtered should three that they keep going up and then it type is also something like that\nOne I think that ... has probably reach the peace now and then the ... foot if the yeah the one they expect that that wouldn't be more gas resources to be found so\nI mean that question here would be should we ask nomination politicians allow for the also the patrolling the gas industry to develop new fields for the future and that's something I Would argue against but but that would be a political question\nAnd and that political question how hard is it then for you if that's what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of our economic security within a decade that's not very long\nNo it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now in off the ... the oil price sale of so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think the ... site it became more\nTo how vulnerable we are to dial industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think in that region\nPopulation do you believe that our oil and gas industry will be their fight for quite some time\nBut it wouldn't have seen that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry is as well and we should try to find new ways of living that would also help the world that find solutions to the climate the to the climate problem\nThere is a ... a crisis could be the ...\nYeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in our way of it sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera\nBut they haven't really realized the effects of climate change so more often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually a plan for it\nBut we can't really hold for a climate crisis for Norway to to react\nGay uh ... the climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which Norway considers its dependency on on oil and gas is how\nHow we we we we have to remember the last eight years we we reached peak oil in two thousand or so we're ... production of oil from the last eight years\nSo we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing and with the predictions I see I can see that the one that is shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime\nAt least ...\nBut then what does that make media but line that change look for new ways role in that particular debate but\nAlso started up what you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry a scares right you've you've lost this debate will look we all\nLost escape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle\nClimate change and we're looking at three to four degrees yes it is and and I would strongly insist on that we need to shift the economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here that's\nWhy I've come back to this is a political question because the purely ... resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is not so hopeful ah for the oil industry in terms of the economics at guide I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables will have a bigger role can she wants to come to\nYou know I mean of course there will be more renewables but also the road we'll requests more energy so now we have to look ... question as well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good here uh I think the uh we'll we'll have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the near future and in the long term as well\nAnd it will be necessary to meet the green just\nNot a lot of agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas tank you to ... ... ... a ... office and Gary Saudi

labeled as\nThe field evolves we have gone from believing that eating disorders were a phenomenon that only affected young affluent white European or North American women to understanding that eating\nDisorders actually are prevalent around the globe\nThis is Kathleen pike a psychology professor specializing in eating disorders at Columbia University in New York\nShe told me the ten China up until the Nineteen nineties only a handful of cases of anorexia ... had been recorded recent studies suggest that as being a dramatic increase since then although there are no official statistics\nIn multiple different locations in China the rates of eating disorders and the presentation of\nAnorexia nervosa blaming her votes of binge eating disorder are all more or less on par with what we see in North America and Europe at this point\nKathleen tells me China's rapid economic growth has driven the change as countries ... show and economic transition she says conditions become right the eating disorders to develop\nOf the things that happens is that populations on average increase in weight and in many cases that's a good thing but it is a problem for\nA subset of individuals within the society who then are at greater risk for eating disorders are you saying that needs to be an abundance of food in society before someone has an eating disorder\nThat's certainly the case for the eating disorders that are characterized by binge eating so ... and binge eating disorder they tend to correlate with\nRising population weight\nAnd you can only have rising population weight when you have an abundance of food\nSo it's not totally the case for anorexia nervosa that tends to have a pretty steady prevalence rate regardless of population wait the cause of eating disorders is multi factorial right so\nIn the context of economic development people also become much more sedentary\nPeople are eating more and burning fewer calories and so our weight goes up\nThe problem is that in a global world the global beauty ideals are largely thin ideals and that's not such a surprise because beauty ideals are typically the state of being that is difficult to achieve\nAnd so in our world now where there's an over abundance of food and it is difficult\nTo avoid gaining weight then the beauty ideal of the thin woman becomes all the more paramount is it too simplistic than to say this as a result of westernized ... yes as we see the rise of eating disorders and other parts of the world\nThe patterns are on the ...\nHand similar but in each case there are unique aspects to the presentation and the understanding of eating disorders and\nCultural context for Kathleen then to really understand the rise of eating disorders in China we need to make stole the cultural context let's start by asking someone have had an eating disorder when they felt that was anything about Chinese culture that make them particularly vulnerable\nOkay so high everyone um my name is Seth I Am currently Twenty one years old I Am\nWhen staff was that team she went on what she described to me as a bit to the health kick which spirals and anorexia and eating disorders characterized by a ... which typically results from a pass and reducing the amount they eat and increasing the amount they exercise\nI think it was the first of January very dramatic speech um my mom brought me to um my GP it was just like a regular check up but when I got there they couldn't find my pulse and they they said I was like you know\nOn the verge of ... I didn't even know it all you know the thing is just lives is the most wonderful [laughter]\n[laughter] I Know it was it just kind of um [noise] it's kinda like a past um section of my life\nYou don't have as we talk that despite the last us that takes over this very seriously she's ... she could have died had talked to I wanted to put him in hospital where she would have been cheap fat but not given psychological support instead her mom agreed to help them recover a time\nThat was five years ago and that's now a psychology student in the U. S. writing a thesis on the intersection between culture and eating disorders she's from Hong Kong but says the cultural factors she's identified apply to much of China\nIn Chinese culture you might be expected to eat everything that is put in front of you but let's say the media that\nI was being approached by at the time was saying like oh being Stennis better all these kinds of different like moral connotations that are attached to weight loss and wait in general and so it would be like oh am I supposed to respect my culture\nAnd you know eat everything that's put in front of me or do I want to be quote unquote successful in terms of what the media prescribing it as do I want to be the best and of course in my competitive mindset of the of course I Want to be the best um and so there's this weird conflict going on and\nDo you think there's anything about women's role in society that comes into play here\nYeah for sure women are expected to be like smaller and not only in the way that they behave but also like physically small even though I can say that in Hong Kong it's already more progressive than like maybe other Chinese communities in the sense that women are allowed to take charge of their husband [laughter]\nIf you are slightly larger in behavior or in the ice just like you know you are a slightly more muscular woman even if you will be like stared at it and um even myself as a woman who like lift weights I Do get a lot of weird stairs and I have\nHad like doctors tell me things like oh if you have too many muscles no one's going to want to marry you and he was a doctor it's so normalized on that\nYou know people who are on like the ... or even expressing disordered symptoms no one really diagnosis that it only when when girls are dying oftentimes when when people are dying that's when they're diagnosed with eating disorders\nStaff told me it wasn't until she moved to the U. S. the university and she had people talk about eating disorders as a mental rather than physical illness\nPeople will say oh I had a headache instead of like I'm I'm not feeling you know emotionally well today and that's what I Would I get I deeply felt during my eating sorter but I was like oh just it's just because like my head hurts for my stomach hurts because these are the things that most people express their coverage it like that's the language that we use\nStaff told me that even the what used to describe eating disorders themselves didn't feel right\nThe Chinese translation of anorexia it's actually teaching food disorder I think it's just very misleading the way that\nUm it's name in my particular case [noise] um I I Love food with like my whole entire heart like food is life and so my eating disorder um developed it largely because I thought that if I could control myself in front of the things that\nI I really loved and um I used to eat with like know that you know then I could control my entire life\nAfter a couple of weeks I I could do it it was like a show what's been saying oh girls want peace and I wanted to be extraordinarily than\nThe kind of thing that makes people stop\nAnd go wow when they see you\n[noise]\nIn two thousand and fourteen when I was just out of university my condition got really bad\nI was consuming up to six kilograms with food in one sitting on new deep down it must be some kind of disease but I thought I was alone so I started searching on the Internet and found that there was lots of people like me\nI actually made friends with one girl and ... who is going through the same thing by hundreds really damage from rubbing against my teeth when I'm ... it was the same for her we used to swat photos of a hurricane\nDid anyone around you recognize what you've dining three\nWhenever I was at home my mother would just be really happy to see me to ... my father is very big um tradition\nAnd so it's all about not wasting food for him so even if I said I'd finished eating my father would make me the rest that would mean I'd have to make that day because I knew I exceeded the amount of calories I wanted to consume ones when I came home from college on the relatives were like wow you've lost so much weight\nNo one really cat if I was a piano\nI had no life to speak of my time was entirely occupied by my eating disorder\nI also felt I wasted so much money on all the food I could have spent on other things I really wanted to get back to so I started to turn things around I'd go to the gym to exercise\nOr I got friends who got my money so that I couldn't spend on food than a ... diet thing did you have to seek professional help for the problem\nHere including should you should come over for anybody\nBecause some Chinese Chinese people are very conservative in this respect we wouldn't tell strangers about illnesses also when I go into other sufferers who had sought medical help I called the feeling that don't just don't see this as impulse and\nAnd I'm a nurse so I Know the ... says they don't get eating disorders you just need to learn how to control yourself over a period of time slowly it will get better\nI feel in China most people around me just don't understand ... country of friends who are below need you off but [noise]\n\nBy ... and staff\nTold me they didn't think doctors could help them [noise] so well still to name the psychiatrist how common this attitude as she told me it designed to be in control is what drives many eating disorders and that can be why suffer as a reluctant to hunt as a responsibility to doctors\nShe says the real problem when it comes to treatment is that this fall to lift all available according to the world Health Organization and twenty fourteen ... every one hundred thousand people China have less than two psychiatrists\nThe figure in the U. S. is twelve it's not clear how many of China's psychiatrists specialize in eating disorders but since we've had ... from the knee closed was offering treatment in the whole country oh\nWas it ... and this is not simply a question of mistrust in dumpsters treatment for eating disorders spills very underdeveloped in China it very difficult for a patient to get a correct diagnosis Oprah treatment it's only possible in Beijing and Shanghai\nLeaders of mental health but it was neat to sit up and pay attention\nIf the patient is in a local hospital they will not receive any kind of standardized treatment and will basically be put with other mental health patients that died in behavior will be managed but that's it that probably wouldn't be any psychological intervention and that is just a reality\nIn\nRise of eating disorders in China and the lack of understanding and treatment available isn't unique to the country who they some of the cultural attitudes and behaviors that feel it might be it seemed was eating disorders rise with economic development it can take some time for a corresponding\nA stick it out and Senate does pay for the last team depend on them from doing science team often\nEating disorders are still filled rich white west and one is probably [noise] we're going to talk\nMore about this next week claimed well look at the experiences of acronyms suffering from eight to ... in South Africa actually in the act and the last ... last name what you think\nAbout what you've had on social media and using the hash tag BBC the chain went on to attack at anytime is BBC for me and the rest of the ... forest sellout ... okay ... thanks punishment and join us again the chain ...\n[noise]\n\nThis is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

W the chemical weapons agency based in the have one that was investigating the use of nova joke in the English city of ...\nSo with that in mind what kind of relationship between the U.S between the west and the Russians what kind of a relationship is that now is a new Cold War\nI've been speaking to an apple ... who's a historian and commentator and the British member of parliament bumped CD who was a journalist in the Soviet Union when it existed I began by asking and she react well badly to the phrase new Cold War\nI actually dislike the phrase because that leads people to roll their eyes and say oh no not that again we've that's over I Do think it's correct to say that we are living in a time when we are facing once again an ideological challenge to the idea of the west and the challenge is coming in part from Russia which\nCertainly sees itself\nAs at war with us in the very broad his sense Russian public is fed with the daily diet of\nAnger and hatred about the west in western institutions the Russian government invest in anti western anti EU anti NATO political parties all over Europe they see themselves as in an ideological struggle so in that sense I think the phrase is although unfortunate is correct\nAbove CD you were in the Soviet Union now you are a part of Britain's political C ... is Cold War and accurate for ...\n... it is and it's because it's clearly not anything like the Russians touch 'em it's just in eastern Germany much weaker but it is a Cold War in the dictionary definition of total means which is a core of Assad is an interesting thought proxies and information war I you know\nI'm they may not have troops in eastern Germany but they have lost number of troops just over the border from Estonia for example I'm going to carry out loud scale maneuvers along the border of the European Union and NATO could tone hot\nObviously I don't know the answer to that it's certainly true that Russia is using its military exercises almost as a weapon in the information war So Russia has carried out very very aggressive\nExercises up to and including practicing the use of nuclear weapons\nThe point of doing that is to intimidate countries on its borders to show this kind of aggression therefore to weaken support for NATO and some of those countries\nI think what Russia would really like to do is when the war when the ideological ... without fighting but I don't think we can exclude the possibility Sunday they will use weapons the Russian Army the same is that it does what an exercise as\nBob Said he will not ideological contest that mark the fifties sixties and seventies between the Soviet Union and the west what could be done what should ... governments like the u._k. government will the u._s. do in order to calm things down\nI think we'll start because although this is ... it was Richard ... communism versus liberal society it\nIs a former Russian ... some of the great threat to mankind structured so she is ... how are we in the worst\nOffenders enough research from those very for the sophisticated all ... states are developing means of state control which is on conventional controlled people but also to aggressively sauce with China or whether that Russia or whether it's for every other powers in future years\nYes maybe I was wrong maybe it is I'd be logical all of those people who want to be presidents for life you know authoritarian regimes versus those who don't\nWhat you mean by ideological but I mean I think certainly we are in a war of values are at war is the wrong expression there is a struggle for values which values are going to dominate Europe over the next uh in the coming decade there are now parties who are part of the ruling coalition and Italy as there are for example in Austria\nWho also have very close links to Russia and who admired\nAn advocate the Russian model of of politics corrupt crony capitalism authoritarian rule one man rule one party rule there is certainly a struggle of ideas\nAnd Bob CD can then the west can NATO can Britain afford this contest because it seems that robust armament might be the way to resist\nReversed on them is one way I don't necessarily the structure is too much to go to Richard Richard restricts a democratic gets ... we can housing for registrations per country that if you represent should always ... or any of ... to be up from the opposite\nSo this is sort of become\nCoach we can give her was on\nTV stations it deliberately lie rex which church ministry done well there's there's there's all the vision arbiter it must've coat starts up as we did the end of the Cold War is a multi agency group for us to expose explosion by the states that's\nObscene a member of the British parliament's and the conservatives the ruling party and an apple by the historian we can talk to serve drinks but our correspondent in Moscow now I'll ask you about these allegations and reaction in a moment Sarah but since we're talking about the Cold War what does that phrase ever end to the media in Russia\n[noise] it does yeah it's a sort of ... around in the same way here as it is I guess in a in Western Europe and and that's why I'm like that I mean I guess I'd say that that is being twenty five years if I open society here and however much sometimes it seems to be going back to the past I'd say on a\nHuman level things have changed so much hair that it's hard to think of us going backwards again I mean you know we talk about the penetration of state media here and how that influences people's opinions and it certainly does but\nI look at what's happening recently with all the uh digging investigation that's being done by Jen let's say in Moscow Russian journalist primarily digging up on the Internet information about people who are supposed to be secret agents you know things have changed people's mindset has changed\nAnd there are tempted to reverse the clocks and and to go back to the thinking of old but in practical terms I think that's a very different difficult clock to set back\nWhat then has been the reaction to these very detailed allegations from the Dutch government about this attempt to penetrate the chemical weapons agency the obesity W\nWell that is an old school reaction that ... dismissal in denial from Russia I mean the the uh the parish of accusations that's been coming from the west I think as slightly uh surprised must go up but it's replied in it and as usual way in a way that we've seen ever since\nI guess getting back to climate annexation of Crimea and eastern Ukraine Seventeen and they stay in school to know the rest of it is all about saying that we didn't do it and accusing the west in this case the spy mania the foreign ministry put out a
