Mr Trump has made it up so it's clear that I'm lost he's not just pretty happy about this or they should be even severe consequences because he's driving policies to contain the arms trade with Saudi Arabia\nHow much is in the know about this case there were reports\nI think on CNN that um have CIA representative who speaks fluent Turkish just heard the alleged tape of the ... amendment and killing this man\nWell it's very difficult to know how much I'm Mr Trump knows about things and certainly how much he believes them but uh\nI'm just a report if the ripples of truth that she has this and she has brief to\nUm I'm not sure that that has made a huge difference there has been a change of tone from him he's been increasing the critical of the regime and has cost ... most recently for the remains to be done to to be identified and returned\nNow a ... it's very interesting and I think we will have a a very interesting comment on this but the the body has almost certainly the location of the body must be known to the southeast because they have the people who allegedly did this\nI think they are trying to take as much time as possible to prevent a or reduce the likelihood of the bodies\nI'm a ... if you'd like evidence being identified ticket publicly because that will do more than anything else is coming from the horrible way this man was treated\nAnd it will be the best evidence of the horrific nature of this regime in terms of how it deals with people that he doesn't agree with the vengeful nature of the day they're out to\nYou on the crown prince being tasked by the king of Saudi Arabia to overhaul the security service realistic in any way\nI don't think so I think that uh the these are all these ... very carefully thought out strategy you first element of their strategies to distance the crown prince from uh the these allegations of seconds to deflect blame on the agency and its members the the Eighteen month suspect team\nOr the third thing is to to lay the discovery of the body so that the evidence comp beat that easily identified\nSuit black as a forensic scientists were going to let you lose some of the title of this case and if the meal time for you if you're listening\nOr anyone listening then perhaps now is the time to to take a break because the details could be a bit grizzly that's all health warning of the Turkish authorities sue originally such do well in the residents of the Saudi consul general what exactly will they be looking for\n[noise] well what we don't know em is the depths of the well and that's extremely important and we also don't know necessarily what are the contents of the well so whether it is dry or whether it's wet\nCertainly in a in a lot of the war crimes situations we worked in in the past wells are viewed as being quite convenient places in which to conceal about eight partly because they're really difficult\nTo access the base of that well so if it's particularly deep then there will be issues of actually getting access to the remains if it is constantly flooded if there is Walter at a great that that again makes it more and more difficult\nThe ... the ... and Walter then it will start to decompose under one of the\nThe great says uh enemies of identification whether that's identification of the individual\nOr identification of the mechanism of the death is in fact time and decomposition and the fact that it's this men but presumably allegedly um partly so um although there that are generally well there are several fairly well recognized reasons why people this member\nThat the most common one is simply for the ease of transportation\nBut they don't like the last I think that's that's very much for your case situation or that's one of the things that's come out this week is the energy on the law has achieved a world consensus and are they all around the world people react the same way too she hung saying\nStories are images or the or hunting hunting has no go to concerts as we all different types of the way Americans see hunting or they will go to Africa decorate their houses and that's that's a piece in the u._k. do that but generally speaking we direct the American started understand all of a pheasant chasing\nAnd they're not being hunting in China and they have a completely different view today said that the Americans and also the Germans in the days\nDo you understand [laughter] I I'm I'm thinking of ... the hunting ... you know you say that they you know this is an important job it is a huge win overpopulation of these animals like a ...\nYou know that it's humane ... you know he get them short wrong and hit an animal in the leg and then somewhere else which she did in the eye and it's that goes on it you know this is not a scientific way of doing things using it\nNow you can never be perfect size or is\nIt about all you can do is try very very hard but the thing is it's extremely difficult to catch a a rifle license in the u._k. I was probably unusual we wear all about the gun licenses hunting is very easy here throughout the rest of Europe is all about hunting license and it's quite easy to get hold of the guards\nUm so what we want to do is make sure that all of a license or is it knows how to risky in any way I mean if anything goes wrong I mean if you if you ... around the countryside or doing something about that you know being in LA or if there is that we're\nStill if as a safety issue then you know you risk losing your ... your right for life says a lot of activity you go to a girlfriend got a job doing something else\nI saw when I told you was doing a story about hunting you did a little bit of a rolling will [laughter]\nWill because it's one of those topics where I think they're all very strong feelings um particularly against hunting\nA to point I think he's being made is that I'm a it is very likely that most of these animals would have to be shot 'em to call them and what we have here is some people in denial about the fact that various reasons environmental otherwise we kill animals\nI'm now a several people who believe that's wrong on that any circumstance\nI think this isn't a topic where you can hold 'em provide a coherent argument it's an emotional issue\nAnd I think we should all agreed to a inflicting unnecessary inhumane suffering is wrong under any circumstance but sadly we do have to kill animals in most cases\nSue black we've established that you're comfortable with dead thing now you're also from I think you said your grandmother was from the west coast is going yeah how do you what do you think about the ... of these photos\n[noise] I I think just as as I saw how sad but there is an acceptance in the back of our minds some way\nThat animals may need to be killed under the argument that they need to be killed because nature's nature but when we do\nThen it's appropriate that it is done in as humane interesting they use the word humid and the humane way as possible what I think we're seeing in particular in relation to this case is the fact that it's the trophy hunting\nIt's turning the predator and then I think the extra thing on top of that was the fact that this is a woman\nIn camouflage with high powered rifles and you can ... and I think that's where the real shock because this has come in like an invasion to some in some ways I think it sounds innovation on different levels it's happening in our land we know that happens in our land we know that there is a big business in hunting in times of tourism\nBut to actually see it and to know it I think are two different things and when and what you see is this woman looking very confrontational in her camouflage with a high powered rifle I think that's what's really jarred this story and to the level that we're thinking about OK\nCharlie Jacoby are you sure you couldn't make the same money ... some people paying to come and look at the wildlife through binoculars you know the magnificent bags of the west coast of Scotland even the wild goats would attract a crowd\nSo we are unfortunately um because we also do that on many that they really around ...

about the extremist element but no yes the there are a mainstream Republicans who have nothing to do with the extremist the point of course is that\nMr Trump 'cause I'm always tend to to exploit the

been increasing for quite a long time and has always been this question I vote when it's going to stop and many people have thought well it's got to stop at some point and it's got to be some natural limit to what the human body is capable of\nSo that like to study has come from quite surprising uncle they've looked at uh when we die and they look if you ... the age at which people are likely to die on a ...\nYou can see the time any one particular point in time and it's a beautiful ballad because it goes up and then he reached the peak and then it gets back down on the other side and a nice ...\nAnd that's a beautiful ballad cause has been shifting ... uh in people's lives of the century have progressed\nSo um it's just been the kind of still looks the same now if the U.S some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right hand side of the cubs would start to get compressed and which are much more cramped up but you know doing that\nSo you think I felt so we'll cluster often that you have I don't know loads and loads and loads of people dying eighty five Ninety exact amount not what's happening I\n... and it's not doing that so I'm of course it doesn't tell is such a than I can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that the ... will not altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways old fashioned replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on our body for instance maybe I'll bones just a destined to crumble after such an age old\nMay be the right to which we can replace nice cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say that was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nThanks class now that I was saying when we discussed life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S slow it down in the less than you might expect and one of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and Fifteen people die from an opioid overdose\nThe people come from all walks of life but in San Francisco a team of public health workers it's focused on treating the most vulnerable populations homeless people almost city streets\nNow is that a couple of weeks ago on the size of the homeless population is very visible next month voters that will decide whether the city's biggest businesses many of them tech companies have goals should face a special tax to fund both more homeless shelters and more addiction centers like this one out of inventing the report [noise]\nI'm here at city hall and the center of San Francisco within yards of the buildings gleaming dome there clusters of homeless people huddled in doorways frozen pigments are slowly pace in the streets [noise]\nEvery week though to bury the other team walked to the district to build a poor with homeless people with addiction problems and they offer on treatment\nBunch trust with established encourage patients to visit the city's public health clinic today to steady stream of homeless people [noise]\nInside the clinic known as a home without health center I mean James don't his real name from a medic in the U.S army recently started treatment for heroin addiction\nRight now I go to prescription Ridgefield ... ah the doctor it was also like DNA shoulder but for a you know is there are other things that can be [noise]\nJames her therapy has been prescribed the pornography and to help him off its opioid addiction ... is a daily pills that reduce his job where cravings and the extreme physical pain of withdrawal\nDespite being an addict for over ten years James wants to change\nThis medication ... century or I was um me to do or do talks of lists painfully um and I are\nNo longer have interns cravings for for the substance abuse or it's definitely more comfortable when I'm cold turkey for instance or or just without any medication of systems\nWell not really be goes outside matter we know that these are really really bad form of dementia that affects the old brain so we were in a way kind of expecting these kind of a result\nOf what you think it is about listening to someone reading aloud that's making a difference because it does seem extraordinary in a way that it could make a difference to me\nWell not really because when you are actually listening to a story you're actually strengths fearing some of your memories in order to feel the holes that are in the story so let's let's do a little experiment if I I started reading view of someone\nWaiting for his luggage you might regional allies in your mind song I don't know maybe get the care port\nHell yes or gas stretch away I was thinking of an apple and I'm thinking of ... and that they can better hasn't even started yet that\nThat what I mean so your brain works with some scripts and those groups you build these groups on the basis of your own memory basically it's back and forwards\nKind of process so the story gives you some and but you feel these weeds your own memories so it's not really surprising actually\nAnd people seem interested in the stores that they were being read to people discuss them together\nYeah so beautifully I mean you're not allowed so there's a lot of variables coming in in the experimentation but I can say that all those variables are\nActually three grabbed by the reading because you have something on which you can discuss with the others so it might be that it's about how not achieve affects your brain and also the situation that comes up in these kind of training or disease\nAnd with the kinds of differences that you saw in memory how important to all those all the difference is big enough to allow people with dementia to do something that hadn't been able to do before to take power more in conversations\nAre well I don't know but let's say that you've before they couldn't actually remember at least of names after let's say ten minutes now they can do that so there's a little bit of improvement\nBut the main improvements for me it's about out to be a graphical memory so once they start to to have a better memory and about the best for months evening memory they started to that allows their own stories\nWhich is something that it becomes really really bad in the form of dementia so at least reaching that point in which you got to remember something of your life or your own life that I think something really good\nSo would you like to see more reading aloud in presidential campaigns to try to help people\nObviously obviously I Would like to see these upbringing in many many different situation because it's a strong training it's a really good training and it was really cheap and easy to implement you just need a book and everybody was everybody we have a book in our house and someone who read to you\nTalk to them all ... now ... this was a small study so I guess it's not suggesting this was enough to slow down the process at the mentors that but it's it's really interesting\nIt was really interesting um we we've got to be careful as well because some with these kinds of studies\nThat can be a big placebo effect you know just I'm\nFrom the extra stimulation that people got probably interacting with the the people who were reading to them and in fact she's already recommended by nice the official ah UK\nAnd they chests guidelines buddy or that one thing you can do with people with dementia is just try and get them more mental stimulation in in various ways you know just talking to people and\nTrying to stimulate them ah intellectually in any way you can\nAnd this reminds me of some of the interventions that do take place the other side of tapping done with people with a bunch of things like saying all reminiscent therapy\nYes reminiscent therapy it sounds almost similar because in a way on it getting them to tell their own stories and find new uh you talk to people about their memories from that used and you you might use ... photos\nFrom when they were children or object so videos if you have them to try and get him to talk about some of them are very old memories and we do know that same people with dementia often it is a very old it's memories\nTo tell them I didn't tacked\nSo I guess with the lack of effective medication anything that might help people's memories that they've got dementia is going to be a good idea\nYeah the F understandable that people are resorting to all these rather unusual techniques because unfortunately we don't really have any good medicines\nThat can do a lot for dementia I mean they're awesome much that people can be given they tend to just um ease symptoms ... hops don't want for everybody and unfortunately they they can get side effects to set and not right for everybody so and this is why we're trying such unusual things now\nThank you very much tied Wilson from Utah contests are coming in today and thanks to the ...

world wars European science had actually gone into decline relative to the u._s. for instance when I was growing up in India and when I graduated I never even considered going to Europe\nThe U.S was the default destination not just for me but for him my entire cohort I don't know anyone who actually went to Europe so\nWhat has happened in the last forty years that has restored Europe to become a global powerhouse leading science area again and I'm In my opinion is the ease with which people can\nInteract and move across Europe of course funding is part of it the funding allows movement and allows collaboration\nBut I think mobility of people allows exchange of ideas exchange of expertise different ways of looking at problems and that's always been important for science\nIn point I mean you clearly being very mobile and you're in Korea so what is it the mobility brings to an individual scientists\nI think what Bill itty chicks you out of your little narrow ways of thinking and you're exposed to new ideas new ways of tackling problems and also when you meet people from different parts of the world and different cultures and tone it broadens your own mind that makes you more open\nAnd one is openness important it's important because really new ideas come from completely unexpected quarters and the more open you are the more likely it is that you'll be receptive when that sort of unexpected sought enters your head\nIt was mixed concerned about growing barriers to scientific corporation the welcome trust and the together science can contain commissioned report on travel

not just about cutting jobs let's say in other countries\nNow if they can be moving abroad for me such condition but but it can also be shorter tend to attend a conference and meet with ... to take out and what\nDid your survey sort of show the benefits that scientists get from this movement\nYes people talked about so they got me such networks having new research ideas and this also times that the previous let you on the topic quit shows that we sat to the movies tend to have that's an academic outcomes said they publish papers they painted the more highly cited unable to develop networks

representation off by medical and health we sat tests but we think we've got a pretty broad coverage it costs me ... internationally particularly in Europe the U.S Africa in Asia\nI guess the point is also it's not just good for the scientists but it has to be good for the song says well for us to care\nYeah that's right and that's why it's so interesting when people point to outcomes slight developing new idea let me start to see that in the electric too it's not just a benefit for and what about me such just it takes is like UK but actually people who travel tend to maintain that went

else because once you've done a postal job go somewhere else starting in Korea and then after we've always thought\nThat was then now the ... stuff on the impact Brexit and changed entities are having that suppose message to the u._k. government it's dark\nI Can't tell you how depressed young scientists all about all the messages that are coming out of government\nThis is just awful you need to be marching purposely not just a non science but we're young people can contribute and oh sorry about the rest of the world you're letting your extremist dominate the debate you got to get a group of them and ... than sending all these five messages\nAs soon as a referendum results were announced I under our society argued very strongly that you citizens here who are already here should be given a unilateral right to remain\nFrom the start to think he run a Christian and and his colleagues at the royal society the highest voice of science in the u._k. for social problems that\nTook two years but finally the government has said that regardless of what happens with the negotiations uses and she'll be allowed to remain here\nBut the question of why you citizens felt particularly bad is because their situation was different from mine I came here on a work permit I had to apply for permission and then I came and then I had to apply for indefinitely to remain and apply for citizenship eventually\nBut when you citizen came here it was under the understanding that this was simply another part of their European home and suddenly they were told that one part of their home wasn't really that home at all and they were really outsiders that psychological transition\nMust have been very hard but what we in the science community want to do is to make sure the conditions of such that they continue to be welcome here regardless of\nAny change in their legal status\nOne of the things I suppose most told the BBC earlier this week was the visa system we have is not fit for purpose I mean do you agree or do that sort of weight or you can point to\nAbsolutely I mean it is atrocious for example I hate to\nThe anecdotal but I had a postdoc\nWho am I was paying on a grant and on her own initiative she got a fellowship from the national institutes of health\nAnd the U.S because she's a U.S citizen and in doing so she saved my lab a huge amount of money but because her funding source was different she had to change and apply for a new visa and because the procedure was so onerous she\nFell into a gap where her old visa was no longer valid and her new visa had not come through and she wasn't allowed to even enter the building she had to sit at home for several weeks twiddling their thumbs in Cambridge is completely outrageous the system has become more and more onerous\nFor non you citizens and if we're going to apply that to everyone in the future of both you and non you we absolutely need a much better more streamlined and efficient system\nThat advice about easy movement was reinforced by responses Susan Guthrie around Europe could invest survey of international science sleep\nPicky found these challenges if a problem for African nation ... say that it's back to the

have been able to travel to the country and we had another ... said she hears lacking in the u._k.\nThey said it's appalling to see what obstacles we set up a lot of countries say the Muslim ban is the most prominent example that my colleagues in South Africa and the ... face similar obstacles that these sheets and discrimination in Port as\nI mean you were talking about the experience for example people traveling from Africa the contrast I guess and that's why most people are talking about race is with a very free movement that varies in Europe at the moment\nAnd only in very restricted area as it presents a problem for us because we can't really determine what these pieces are necessarily and it also brings up a question of why are there so few of them this early on\nI mean how fish like off the kinds of false will be talking about what we recognize them very readily as being really to to try out and called\nNo so they're actually pretty different so back during this time period and most of them are armored they look more or less like clams shells with tails at one end and I like headlights at the other end\nWe recognize them as fish because our cats at the fish is pretty simple I mean any five year old ... fish but they wouldn't look anything like the kinds of rape and fishes that we're familiar with today which includes cat and traffic\nWhat you've done is even though you're saying that the fossil record is ... ... ... there's enough of it for you to throw basically a lot of heavy statistics are the problem of how these things evolve\nSo over that time period we had more than twenty seven hundred different records that different fossils found in different locations and because of the way fossils are preserved because they're preserved in the bottom in the sediment we can determine the environment those from the rock\nHe's in the fossil itself and also the invertebrates that we find there and so that gives us a lot of information about where we're actually seeing the fossils when we do see them and we can use this to reconstruct where their ancestors should have been\nSo that they were four hundred or so million years ago swimming around like ... the sink to the bottom of the ocean and you can recognize what kind of searching the walls from the safe being better did\nAbsolutely so sometimes we see corals buried along with them so we know they were at a reef sometimes we see that it's a river bottom than it has the classic river rocks and conglomerate\n... came ... this was the idea that there was some kind of environment that was more conducive to fish evolution than others\nYeah so the assumption from studies of modern fishes and studies of invertebrates is that everything sort of originates at coral reefs coral reefs are really complex\nThey have a lot of life a lot of opportunities but in these earliest Reeves we just weren't seeing anything that was recognized simply a fish that had bone and so the thought was well maybe it's just preservation of biased maybe they should be there or are they actually coming in somewhere else that explains both as bad record\nAnd their early evolutionary history and so what conclusion do become too\nSo what we found is that vertebrates in fact just as the ... suggested were highly restricted to pretty much coastal waters\nWhat you would call lagoon if you went to a tropical island well ahead of the reef and that they continue to originate and diversify their for something like a hundred and twenty million years so every major group all the way up through sharks or own ancestors the bony fishes\nShows up in this really restricted habitat away from the reefs and basically anything else\nSo I mean how deep when you sing into title how deep would also be in these things\nBasically from the actual beach to about thirty meters at the most but well above say where wave action would be occurring during a heavy storm\nThat's absolutely true and they go home ocean to certain ... to live and like you know they have more ocean and members land and they all just plugging as far as you can go to these coastal regions\nExactly and it's not to clear to us why they're doing that at this point it may be that there's more nutrients there that they face less competition from the early ancestors of insects in sea scorpions which are already in resetting at that time and swimming around and maybe eating tiny fishes if they come across them\nAnd if we get this from what you're saying that the sort of the innovation was going on in these KOSU Waltons but they may have spread out they could have gone to other parts of the ocean as evil but all the new species all the new lineages seemed to be born in these very interesting coastal regions\nAbsolutely so it seems that invasions of the other parts of the ocean is heavily dependent on the sort of traits the sort of foreigners that they take out in the shallow environments so it's really only those fishes that happened to become streamlined and flexible and more active swimmers that then later on invade the reefs in the open ocean\nThe truth of it as that fishes actually move into freshwater first which I don't think anybody would have expected\nThat very interesting also so the fact that you know talking of hour and a fish the front but first land animals are thought to be fish that social just started coming up on the beach oh that sounds like they were to do that kind of expression from the beginning\nYes it does seem that way and it's another good analogy because it's the same situation where you have traits that show up in some shallow water environment like limbs and lungs\nOr the other traits have catcher pods which are land animals and then that's being used to move into a new environment but without any further incredible change until much later\nLower and solemn who study appears today in science and if you'd like to go back to another one or two hundred

although he has been in politics for a long time for Thirty years he's has always been an outsider never in the mainstream and uh what was a witness in the past has become clearly is trends\nMotto don't tell what would you see is is he being his appeal\nI think he had his timing has been excellent he was quietly in Congress for twenty eight years and now he has made this move he tapped into the disc content the frustration of voters the corruption the poor state services the economic recession the job losses\nHe manages to present this blend of social conservatism but also mixes with the economic liberal lives in in his particular vague proposals so he presents these proposals that perhaps I'll back to reassure investors\nCapital markets both international and domestic have been very ... listening to what type of he said and what I've it's been going on the simplistic solutions sometimes present it may be exactly what people feel is will the would like to hear at this moment\nAnd he is very good at talking he doesn't say much why he talks but that's the point sometimes and I think that is really life at the heart of his success typing into the mood\nSo let's think about the background to all of this you mentioned the timing mother talks to just give us a sense of the state of Brazil's economy\nTo the state of the economy is just gradually imaging out to a recession unprecedented two year recession alongside the recession job unemployment has\nReally rocketed up from about six percent before the recession started in twenty uh fourteen uh all the way up to about twelve touching percent in recent years alongside the recession the fiscal management the poor fiscal management of the previous government to beat the governments have been exposed\nBrazil's public debt is Seventy seven percent of GDP some six point two percent of that goes just to interest payments\nThe budget is is in a situation where primaries surpluses of the early years the boom years if you like under President Lula have absolutely disappeared so that they got it up and living beyond it means really well beyond its means and with ... asset to meet\nTo whether I should say the current government has made ... efforts to reform but it is a very fruit a weakened government I'd of very divided Congress says you have on your\nYour agreeing I think in the background\nI entirely and just like to it's a two or three comments one is that it's been the longest recession ever registered in Brazil in history\nAnd the recovery is the slowest ever registered in the Brazilian history\nSo it's hard to imagine from outside the level of social frustration and Brazil\nEspecially when you consider that prior to that\nThere has been a lot of upward social ability and Brazil from two thousand and three until two thousand and ten so the emergence of new so called new middle class in this so called middle class has been severely hit by the recession\nNo laundered that this ... residents decided to who had voted for the tea in the past is no voting massively for ...\nDays the need to be a victim that second stance of the change in global economics China perhaps demanding he looked commodities and so on rather than just an economic mismanagement\nI'll go ahead and we are witnessing in Brazil it's a combination of factors we have witnessed a growth and law employ mentioned Brazil between two thousand and three eyes to Charleston and fourteen or ... thousand unfortunately all words of the criticisms a few months economic policy that\nEven people excited they agree that they are there are

struggling to win votes and it's an action you know that that he I guess got ... yes\nIt's regards to the first racism against uh the austerity measures we agree that that\nThey were wrong but in addition to that we have to remember that right at\nThe beginning of the second term off do must governments tall grass has approved what we call about a bomb bus which our budget bills that ain't pots negatively in Brazil and budget and these weren't employed by the president of the lower house\nQueen wheezing jail right now and also through my support from Brazil and opposition\nIs the old politics\nAs worse it is better for us\nBecause we can't change the game and that as being damaging for the present anymore I'm\nOn a ... that's the problem you see right there they never recognize any mistake that they have done for all those years you know it was very easy round has a lot of critics ... wife Mary easy to have\nA budget surplus when commodity boom and the first term of a Lula was really I I was very happy with his performance I Would have voted for a little bit that I don't I'm hearing you asked for a long time but if I were in Brazil I Would have voted for the first\nBlack pointing out that he increased\nWelfare benefits and introduced a minimum wage yeah and it\nWas the right thing to do but after the subprime crisis you start seeing a lot of controversy ... policies\nThat were not sustainable in the long run\nAnd by the time that a deal made her lacked you see a reverse off many of the part is that the first term of Lula that mood had pursued you start seeing I'm much more interventionist economy\nAnd when you look at the ... program for these election they just talking about increasing resources for areas like education health which you are very important but ... ... what we\nWill talk about that in a bit ... in a bit more details of the moment but I just want to think about the the backdrop to this election you have say president dude I Do the PG president who is embroiled in corruption finds himself in prison his successor Jill I'm a recess who was impeached\nSuggest to those are two factors the economy corruption the face of these two leaders that perhaps it has affected this election enormously but what about the other two things that are getting on the top of that crime and the conduct to this election crime is an enormous feature present in life and Brazilian concern\nFor the for addressing this topic and I take a step back and with all due respect to Diego I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others it's not working any longer to the the tea\nFirst when the scandal when the cyclical a corruption skin was discovered\nThe the PTA react to the shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if they were parts of the conspiracy against the beauty\nThen when a before that when the economy started going down they said that they shifted to blame to the external environment so a yearly this is just rhetoric is not working any longer just looked at the polls I mean people are not buying the story and they won't\nLet me let me try food then let's talk about how crime and they will talk about how this election is being conducted holidays affecting how Brazilians think about which way tonight\nCrime has become endemic in Brazil the reeds have homicides and Brazil\nOr has reached record levels in the last years and now we have three homicides for one hundred thousand inhabitants what puts Brazil among the most violent countries in the world\nHas close ties to the country's current military leadership Brazil lived on direct military dictatorship for more than two decades\nIt came to an end owning in Nineteen eighty five\n... ... what do you think uh both in our government would look like would it have a minute to rustic aspect\nCertainly he has had many military advisors or his vice presidential candidate is a ... a recently retired military general but it's worth remembering that he in fact approached sudden traditional politicians to join his ticket and they were refused so\nThe military was certainly have more influence and government he's likely to appoint ministers who are retired military men\nBut the military in the sense of the currently operating armed forces I think at this point the U.S to trying to not get drawn into let's say this new adventure [laughter] if you want\nA Monica who to do think it's less sacrificing perhaps some of Brazil's democratic credentials if that ... security by moving closer to the minute tree\nThe fact that he's a former military that in itself\nFor many people raise flags but you know I think that the military can be very helpful in many areas of ... of you need we need stronger\nThe fans saw in the in our borders right I Would hope that the fight against drug trafficking will take place on the borders and not in the middle of the cities\nBut it's that ... is that Brazil's biggest problem and what is it is because a lot of the weapons we were getting a lot of the trade of weapons is it just huge and and and they are the tree or it's not a role for the police or the borders for the military\nAnd I've heard from people from find a campaign that they also want to use the military for infrastructure projects in the interior of the country which the military has expertise right I'm\nModerate don't is that is that usual to have the ... would it be welcome do you think in any country to have the minute tree ... involved in in in the in the area\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presence in the Amazon and such that extend the sort of\nNationalist view of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the Florida\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society I think the more important distinction however about the role of the military he's on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude to where it's growth and development\nThe Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most to boost Brazil's development and I think Shia international markets have got to slightly I think or do\nThey think that both ... will be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet and then I don't see how they can expect to realize this sort of economic liberal version that his economic advisor pile to get this talks about that\nYou can I can name jak there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is if you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on it's just the need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many interviews acknowledging that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of the nation of the country in the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption ... associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHis government is clearly one that the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending he's already has a plan to reduce\nThe number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team they have a very clear record of being very pro market in front of you in early ...\nCentury Monica nothing is very clear about what you\nJust read from from from well I'm On the governor\nFor eight years I don't know how this things worse and realize this coalition has been put together hastily\nRight and you have different groups that do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues\nAnd I think a doctor mark through is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic mind side of the military and\nThe liberal team which has been gathering around the economist in a previously in the house finance minister Paolo get let's see how this play out the pros and old programs are deliberately vague\nUs I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called headquarters of his campaign what we have to judge if they if you read the two programs right and I think there is a stark contrast between this programs in the comic projects\nThat is why do we go for the one hand I understand what you're saying that the ... wants to bring power that is really that you put them to the past whether they're going to be faithful I understand that but clearly that's how the business community in Brazil believes as well and you see that\nAnd you just how the stock market and the other behaves when he became a including his lead and then you end up homeless\nRemains it remains to be seen markets are my authored by nature\nNow you know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving ... you know today if I can bring you know there is there is there a mood\nAbout which makes it difficult for the PC well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil but ... days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the states in our lives\nWe have two different very different projects with these two very different approach in one side we have a few of those so narrow himself as a liberal surrounded by mid century or national is on the other side you have a dodge who has a\nKind of a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage or to have a presence [noise] so what we have every zoo is is most states versus I stayed that where we intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people have in jobs\nMarket we spend money and ... that there is in an economy\nFrom is that they don't start they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than the world bank and they compete with the banking system rotting front that that's why\nYou have to get big gassy with I don't know they land they kept the brash\nDaughters when he called on his about well established companies the giving loans like very low interest rates\nMorning at around ... you said that uh both from outer makes very clear comments actually not for example initially they talk about ... stokes about privatization of state owned enterprises and then of course both tomorrow immediately boats in and say oh yeah yeah yeah privatization bucked knocked\nMetro bras not generations or the electorate Ross Perot says almost on the brink of going for privatization is not going to be halted\nIt's all very conditioned maybe ... ... talk has been liberal but I feel the practice when not to be liberal it will be intervention okay because that's the way Brazil has developed let me just presumed development history\nLet's hold on to those two quite distinct views of which way the economy may go I Want to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talked about traditional family values very tough on crime and so on\nThere is a memory of course of Brazil's minute she dictatorship which is still rule that when the repression that followed that\nThere were hundreds of people would disappear do killed and many more were detained and tool shed\nAnd honesty was posted in Nineteen Seventy nine which meant that when they public reckoning on trials about what had happened in those twenty also yes and today the majority of Brazil's votes as in about a hundred and forty seven million of them they didn't live through that but at the regime which came to an end in eighty five\nAnd you documentary the made in ... tells the story of a dictatorship bureau women's president's op how the ... is the film's director and she explain more about the tower\nAt the
