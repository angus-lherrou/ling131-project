up a lot of fear about immigrants from Mexico from Guatemala and Honduras in in the so called caravan are immigrants from um Muslim countries he's very concerned about in has stirred up a lot of fear about but\nWe have a home grown hate movement in the United states and the the mass shooting at the synagogue is just the most recent example of it\nHow seriously do you think we need to take this home grown hate movement and do you think that that we as a nation and that our government is taking it seriously enough\nI don't think we're taking it seriously enough I'm not sure it would be possible to take it seriously enough I think it's potentially the greatest threat that we face I'm just if you look at last week with three major incidents of of\nFar right extremist um terrorism and and our country at I think that that that's a much more real threat than for instance a caravan of of immigrants uh that's thousands of miles away um and and that is hoping to potentially come here

was one of the largest years for for threats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand and for them and it's\nUnfortunately not surprising to me because\nThese are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing immigrants through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of the violent backlash and from from these white supremacist idea is\nIs this an unnerving time for you ...\nYeah it's it's usually and every time for

I'm not agreeing that the taboos but I think often dangerous aren't as risky\nThe one that's in in a lot of conversation now in terms of writing is the idea of cultural appropriation who's allowed to tell what story and I mentioned that because while I don't have any rules about what I can and can't do as an artist\nI I'm sensitive to watch to fuel for ... to me and as a writer living in South Africa who came here in Nineteen Ninety two I Am African you know I I'm a citizen of this country\nBut I'm a particular kind of citizen and so I find that there's certain stories I approach with and I haven't learned how to tell them yet a lot of my main characters are a bit like me\nRight clever though and I mean these has always been political in South Africa that all of that any to be a huge again\nI think at the moment there's a real risk you know which used to having such a history of protests and things are connected to the struggle for freedom on many levels in South Africa and in our current environment much of the opportunities for work\nFor funding to make work is from the government and I think at the moment is a real risk of self censorship so I've actually seen very aware of where the opportunities live and feeling pressure to avoid city narratives and just because those narratives wouldn't be supported financially\nNah\n\n\nAnd I walk which means here is ... ... thank you so much for joining in there on the banks visual all the dance moves or have you\nThought the mount ... we left at Thanksgiving just saying that they we've been talking here on the outside when two in Japan is like about\nThe coming the past let's turn to the future\nTo see what are your hopes for the future creatively in your career\nFuture while I'm like I don't think about like the future in terms of like in the future future because the future future I just wonder is a great zoos greed in the world but like I'm doing a a special next year so that's going to be a national [noise]\n... ah do you think South Africa needs to continue to talk about\nThe apartheid era or move on from that\nThere's no moving on and uh [noise]\nI'll be jovial rather part is a guy [noise] um\nI mean to me it it'll lose essentially to the title of my phone which means or what the title is though the winter to my skin which for me as a butter reflective so that looks back at their whole life and they look at even the hardest times and they look at them and they say you know what that made me who I Am\nSo yeah I think we look at a party and hopefully we'll look at it and say that made us who we are as a nation so no no no no there's no there's no ending of their politics to talk\nAbout what do you think I think the legacy of a project to do so if it didn't in determining so much of how people still live and it's still so normalized that that's the way it is\nSo I think it is to see the rent is going to be talking about I think particularly\nAs a white person and I'm white too soon and can do I ...

outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd he has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at
