about the scale of the Taliban threat the more I get completely confused about what your own government is doing in response for example why is it\nThat you are failing to keep up the force levels that you promised to actually deliver security to the Afghan people\nAs I understand that your according to the Pentagon your force numbers both in the police and the armed forces on now at least ten

by a large machine that they will be handled by ...\nThat we will be setting out the kinds of Sudan temp receipt actually actually in the bank to ensure that the price of the time to like ...

wanted to invite a four of my friends who have never seen the piece had no idea what I'm doing to get into the people who had been working in the whole process and while we have done is being space experience that\nFor I don't know an hour or so I say if you were an audience for the first time and then hopefully they will give me some notes Sunday end\nAnd that can also see what works like if everything works properly for tomorrow they're putting\nOn this feedback on ... on the soundtrack you particular from ... to Isabella made meant ... director from just Morris\nMobile home he said that people are ... to get into ... and then they get a lie down and get back to the will\nAttack and then we got no maybe among other words to how big coincide says more than one person from buying that then they got to think that would be perfect\nWe have just being ready financing to sound that's something of course we have to do often island\nSo um otherwise it would give the whole game the way we did that sharing museums down today and we've also had just been perfecting the tearing regime as well just working out that balance\nSays that the rest of the evening I'm now that we're very happy that everything is working so well we will leave Tanya and Steve together\nUm to jump finesse this final sound levels and the gift tiny all says some time to\nBe alone with lift the work and its final form\nIt's funny because I haven't been nervous yet because you are a focus on like make sure everything works I should like every detail is is Don you know testing it now that everything is done maybe I get nervous\n[laughter] well see\nIt's early the next morning now and the final moments of the process of taking place\nTo man on top of the pool to a lotta around rolling along screw with

[laughter] she saw to see you I Do feel very emotional\nAnd say yes actually the outback\nOkay it's done [laughter] [noise]\nThe real test of the work in the final parts of the ... is of course the public responds and it's ... you must find the image and work revealing it\nWell today I returned baton used to look at it\nThrough people screaming over the great titles doing everything from yoga and don't see too long still should be checking\nThat it's difficult to distinguish the positive uses face from the imprint says the visit to hands and feet\nBut that to me becomes part of the point of it\nThe girls being the full picture is rarely if ever possibly in life\nBut it's pops into Lucian still a noble aspiration\nSo telling you this is it it's now opened\nYour work in many ways not done you have to let this go in and and see what happens\nWhen you spend time studying scrutinizing people's responses will they seen ... you do in the future is the receipt of the next ideally you just going to free the big big son got honestly [noise]\nWell I knew that he had a friend and they say\nThat in the press it up during the speech I had to had so many ideas that I think I have ideas for art exhibition so the next three or four years\nI Love going around ... mostly and listen to what people said that's that's the way I measure what works and why did that work and kinda just in the next facing case is needed so\nDo you still want to tweak if you have the time would you tweak the technology or are you happy now for ... for for jobs to take its course I like it because\nI I have some a quarter of all I can say like do you want it to reveal more do you want to uh repainted so it's easier I think no I mean life is hard people are in this kind of a fake fake a perception that everything is easy and it's been ten years\nHow many people roughly will it does it need to reveal\nThe majority of the ... sign now I can guess around three hundred maybe\nWe may never see it all but as a community of people coming to the tape we can live in hope that that may happen and we should work together on mass to try and reveal that face if only for replacing second\nAbsolutely I work with a neighbor next to you [laughter] [noise]\n\nYou've been listening to in the studio with me to mow the following the creation of time you forget his new installation tightened moment in London the producer was Emma Kingsley and if you want to hear more of the world's leading creative thing 'cause most subscribed to ... go to BBC will ... come forward slash in the studio [noise]\n\nUm this is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

office topic on the program today the plastics drew a little bit wider than that but it's an example of something that could be consigned to history and European Union countries soon on Wednesday the European Parliament voted in favor of a ban on single use plastic products\nThat would apply to such items of strolls plates ... costs in buds which make up more than Seventy percent of waste material in the world's oceans other plastic such as drink bottles will have to be collected separately and recycled at a race of Ninety percent by twenty twenty five on the ... law\nSpeaking during the debate before the vote the Irish Emmy Pete look main Lou committed Flanagan described encountering his first plastic cutlery in the Nineteen seventies and he said nobody thought then that it will prove to be such a threat to the environment\nAt the time we were worried our main worry on this planet wasn't new care Holocaust then they realized that the plastic FARC and ... that I added my hand was actually going to turn out to be more dangerous and I said that now even with who we have in the White House\nBy twenty fifty there will be more plastic in the oceans than there are fish by wage a hundred and turkey different marine species known Dr ingested plastic\nCould have been like this work elsewhere in the world specifically could work in the U.S Peter Morici is an American economist in business professor at the University of Maryland I asked him if he welcomed the legislation from the European Parliament\nA little puzzled as to what the objective is if it's to reduce carbon that's fine but you have to consider that a sweeping ban may cause producers are manufacturers to come up with solutions that are even more harmful to the environment\nAirplanes there's a lot of plastic inside the cabins or airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind\nAlso and takes resources to make that metal just like a dust plastic and takes energy and it's heavier as a consequence that may cause the airplanes and get less gas\nSo to speak and rubbing your carbon footprint\nSo those people that are carrying round the metal knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one that doing the wrong thing or they\nAll I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think of voting the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right across the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable results\nWhile it's not out try it it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good I don't\nKnow it's out right inside of the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throw you in a landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single used plastics and a glass bottle you can take back to shop and refill and using many times as you want to tell them I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of all bottles in the United states that are about twenty five years whether love modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to screw up those bottles up and use them again it's not that single use plastics should be used\nIf not getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternative to sweeping is I mean if you if you introduced legislation to ban single use plastic in August ... doesn't give it a good thing or is it not in your opinion I don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban\nShould such measures to expand that so that it becomes written into global trade deals that well as\nIn not just for the European Union they're certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right what's it like in your plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature\nHowever one wants to has to be judicious about this and think it hurt you have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem\nRight then you decide to just you know blindly thrower regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it's ... it's just kind of I'm thinking man they add a little better for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic I missed the science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk makers\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and

fourteen and it's great to see how the festival has changed in this regard I remember the festival either when he was in twenty four team from that you had\nAnd people making intensely homophobic statements to audience applause and then you had a number of years led the organizers quite consciously I think\nHad panels on Quinn is interviews with Chinese women working with algae beauty

homosexuality is the government of some governments posted in Nigeria in which case you might have full and found that just discussing this year\nWell and then the little actually talks about promotion and operation of gay clubs in societies and I would say that promoting homosexuality as he puts it and any such legislation against that would actually infringe freedom of expression\nJust can't teach by the nature of the constitution and but in the end by his panel was the room was just filled with positivity and warmth\nAnd I'd be really moved by the number of people who've come up to

policies in code ...\nOn the fence or left a speedy on these crises that have been response by personality clashes to certain extent I read irritated versus across Germany that's sick of seeing politicians in both squabbling among themselves say what we could see today\nIs versus in ... in this region punishing the two main governing policies up in Berlin which has nothing to do raise the

I'm a center that part is looking with great trepidation ready at what's going to happen today as a\nPossible gain is in ... I Know you've talked about alternative for Germany 'til you're blue in the face we do every time we mentioned Germany in a political context how about the greens\nWell that's right so we have on the one hand the right wing populists ... Germany on the other hand to the left of the spectrum you've got the greens both parties are doing pretty well it's the greens doing really well\nI'm not because we've had a long hot summer in Germany that's played into lots of green concerns about climate change also the green policy has really credible leadership right now so the business seems very United\n... this is already ... to ... all of our national pitcher in Germany at the big main big tents policies during the last well\nBecause the scientists changed under votes is really look at individual issues rather than loans to loyalties to a left wing or right wing policies say ... votes to become quite fickle\nAnd that's why these these two policies are both extremes of the spectrum is doing pretty well but what we're all ... thing really is that\nThere's a lot of dissatisfaction with the with the main policies I'm not connected to migration because the two big center left center right parties are quite divided on migration\nThe greens are very clear the very pro open borders as they report says the ISD the alternative for Germany are also very clear that essentially a gates migration so when it comes to migration votes is no will those two policies think about\nI think that I don't know that a lot of other\nCountries have that sense that sense of entitlement probably\nIs that how you see it maybe [laughter] Jeanne Marie Laskas her book is called to Obama with love joy hate and despair quite interesting that the American ... with love joy anger and hope\nTo lead a publisher stilted British readership could take swimming darker or we could talk about Obama's legacy Chitra and Matthew and I imagine that you'll speaking glowing terms about that let's start with the importance of leaders listening to their citizens Chitra\nYes absolutely and I read the New York times article that ... votes\nOn which she then they invest into a book and I was really struck by how President Obama took the time every single day\nTo reach ten lapses which an undisciplined and think about them which is really an incredible actually thinking about how busy someone is in that I'm In that an office\nAnd and it's of course it's important to remember that the Obama administration wasn't perfect and especially the number of drone strikes that will open a and that will authorized um some of the policies and practices around immigration and it's easy to slip back with in this town to another way of governing but I Do think\nThat this whole um practice and reading the lapses just shows the grace and the empathy that Obama exhibited and attempting to try and bring the coming of the country together\nAnd trying to engage in all sectors of the population including those who did not vote for him and specifically seeking out those views to try and understand\nAnd not just have to his base which of course is very different from what we're seeing now by the current occupant\nYeah well I'm not sure that as opposed to Mr Trump ... which would see that in such glowing terms reflecting on Mr Obama but how important do you think it is generally Matthew to take the mail from people who voted for you didn't vote for you are\nI'm Still reeling from an extraordinary let's affirm the lines of a talking about his hands these ... and don't show quite why we picked out example but it was it was just like ... and the idea that he could explain his hands with soap ... his wife ... yeah I mean and then ... costing them in prey was transport things\nBut I mean I think on the on the board of not only do they were also price it you know it must have been amazing when you were sitting there was one of his assistants going for I mean they took about a mile back I'm assuming about these rush the emails but it must have been the icing to find these gold nuggets occasionally from time to time\nHe mocked um kid's homework occasionally there was that there is an example of saying\nPretty good you went down misspelling darling cheaper don't like it was yeah talk show and can you imagine being one of the recipients of one of those ten ... you wouldn't lose it would you and you would never forget that I mean of course you know to the question is how did that affect policy and it was fascinating that that I cheat seemed that it did affect\nPolicy on on Sunday and maybe basically\nBut I still see I I think you know we live at a time when so many people feel so dissed empowered by that political systems and I and I'm Talking about in western democracies as much as anywhere else\nAnd and the idea that there's not like that kind of spirit of individual connection between ruler and ruled it is something very very ...

National laboratory in Berkeley, California since the year two thousand five California's building energy efficiency standards\nHave prescribed the use of reflective roofs on commercial buildings the idea behind a cool roof is simple instead of\nPutting on your building a roof surfacing material that is dark and absorbs a high fraction of sunlight\nYou simply instead choose a more reflective version of the same product it might just be a white product\nYou may have an office building or a store that has a membrane roof these are plastic swelled and membranes are available in black or gray or town or a green or whites many cars out there\nThe simplest thing to do would be to choose the white version of the roof\nOn the other hand we know that there'll be many buildings where the roof can be seen from the streets and this will mean that the\nBuilding's owner or perhaps the buildings architect will seek a color other than whites\nWe can do that to only about half of sunlight is visible if you want to have a reflective roofs that is not white but will still stay cool in the sun you can focus on reflecting the half of the sunlight that you can't see you can for example\nGet a red roof that reflects only twenty percent of the visible light giving it it's red color but at the same time reflects about sixty percent of the invisible light the end result is that you reflect about forty percent of all of the sunlight in fact it\nRoughly doubles the solar reflect ... compared to a traditional red roof\nAnd just in case you're thinking what's the big deal on like the heat
