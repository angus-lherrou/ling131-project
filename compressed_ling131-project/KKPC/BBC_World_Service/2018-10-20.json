cervical cancer and twenty sixteen after receiving to incorrect may a test results\nThe crisis in the national screening program has to lay treatment for at least two hundred and Twenty one patients with cancer we almost all the health correspondent federal ballots he's been covering this scandal for many months to take us back to how it all again\nWithin two thousand eleven Vicki feeding and who's a forty three year old mother of two from limerick how to smear test animals incorrectly given the all clear she developed terminal cancer and she sued the held serves executive and one of the ...\nThere was a settlement of two point five million euro reached in April with clinical pathology labs in Texas with those admission of liability and there's emerged in the case that her twenty eleven smear test which showed no abnormalities was found in a twenty fourteen orders of smear tests on a number of women to be incorrect\nAnd keeping them was the first woman to go public on the issue crucially she refused to sign a confidentiality agreement as part of our settlement\nSo that led to all of the documents in this case being made public which effect of the broke open the scale of this issue here is Vicky feeling on the steps of the arch high court in Dublin speaking after her settlement on the twenty fifth of April\nThere are no winners here today [laughter] I Am terminally ill and there's no cure for cancer [noise]\nMy sentiments will mostly be spent inviting me time and I'm paying for clinical tries to keep me alive and to allow me to spend\nMore time with my children [noise]\nIf I die and a truly hope that won't be the case then when it would provide for my family [noise]\nThe women of Arlen can no longer put their trust in the service contract programs [noise]\nMistakes can undo happened but the conduct of certain checking the hatred the in my case is unforgivable\nAnd once it had become clear that there were problems with the test how come over and then went told that they needed to be retested\nNuts a major issue here I mean cervical check had done this all just a look back on every case of cervical cancer diagnosis to see what the original slide reviewed had found so they're reviewed over three thousand cases\nThat old has had essentially been done for educational purposes and as well as well intentioned but very poorly managed\nSo women weren't told their slides of being reviewed and critically that in certain ... two hundred and Twenty one cases they might have benefited from an earlier a diagnosis or a different intervention\nSo that initial group of two hundred and Twenty one women are families were identified by the health service we now know that twenty women have died but we don't know the cause of death in all cases\nSome women died without ever knowing about this orders\nCervical jak had told some doctors that several women shouldn't be told that a false negative results have been identified into sodas\nThere was a dispute of sorts between cervical track headquarters in Dublin and doctors and hospitals around the country at the who should actually have responsibility for protecting the women doctors who would not being involved in this all just\nSome of them didn't feed it was their job to be telling women that perhaps mistakes have been made by others but not by them\nSo it was the reason that they knew by the end they had cancer that time it passed and taunted moved on to the abnormal cells that are being seen on the initial Smith had been developed into ...\nYes I mean that that's correct also the way some women were told is also an issue the subsequent inquiry found there'd be no what they said was a ... paternalistic culture by conditions\nThat some doctors told patients of the issue in a very hard for them on the fence away the report quotes from various women voting coups quotes like doctor said what difference would it make one woman asked how will I be informed from now on almost told by her doctor watch the news\nAnd then also one consultants pointed to a woman smoking habit ... and ... her about her her diagnosis and another a consultant said ... don't get cervical cancer\nA comment that if you weren't having sex you wouldn't catch the virus that causes cervical cancer I Do believe some of these cases we'll go to a medical council hearing I think that to some of the women will make a report and there will be ethical unprofessional tribunals into the forms of some doctors\nNot just recently another of the women who was awarded a large settlement has just died itself\nYeah so in June and the victim who knows if I'm coming to carry with five children settled her case against another lab quest diagnostics in America for seven point five million euro\nEmma died over a week ago and she was an amazing campaigner for truth in this affair and she fought very hard for her children to protect them and ensure their future there was a huge outpouring of sadness in the country this week during her funeral\nShe was speaking on our to your radio after she learned her cancer had spread\nTo take their life and ... and a half and I'm going on I don't think my cheerleader guy\nAnd I got married I tried everything\nAnd what does the government that they'll do about it well the government was forced to order a review\nAnd it appointed the British public health expert Dr Gabriel scali and his report was published quite recently and he found the cervical check system was doomed to fail he found serious gaps in the expertise in governance of us you did find no evidence of conspiracy corruption or a cover up\nBut he was highly critical of the attitudes and lack of openness by some doctors and not ... of the results or the way they were told and\nHe called has called for a mandatory open disclosure into health system here so legislation needs to come into play structure or something like this doesn't happen again under discussion as we speak at those a compensation tribunal being set up to avoid women like Dicky feeding\nAnd ... and we're going to having to go to court\nFor a difficulty hearings to get compensation\nSo do the women who were affected by these Smith tests that were incorrectly reported now ...\nThere's going to be other as a doctor scali appeared before a parliamentary health committee last week to discuss his findings\nAnd he said the basis by which the ... executive has calculated this group of two hundred and fifty when women that that was slow so he did say undoubtedly more women will be found to be affected\nThe results were view we're going to be a review about one thousand days hundred and fifty slides by a team from the royal College of obstetricians and gynecologists in Britain\nSo that should tell us more some women understandably don't wish to get involved in it or for legal reasons won't give consent for flights be examined the will be more women the exact numbers we don't know yet\nI was talking to federal powers now changed the world life expectancy tables that out with protections for how long people living in different countries might live on average in the future and Japan which had the highest life expectancy and twenty sixteen doesn't help the child so who does\nYour Japan's been leading the world for ages and this focus it goes up to twenty forty says life experts in Japan will be eighty five point seven years well he's been bitten by pointing wonder if he is a little over a month by studying at age four point eight years\nAnd this is in the future that isn't that this is now\nYeah this is the projection looking at current health trends whack countries all around the world are going to be by twenty forty and Walt\nThis team of scientists have done is they've looked at Seventy nine risk factors that affect your house or that's things like smoking rates of obesity rates the possibility of access to clean water and sanitation and some more unlikely things like income education levels\nAt pollution looking at those trends and then for casting into the future in about Twenty years time ... impact those changes and those kinds of going to have a life expectancy so all the countries all around the world\nSo Spain's getting it right what are they doing\nWell it's this transition that we've talked about before I think most people know what's going on of how the things that kill us the stuffing being those big infectious disease and then more diseases of lots of things like heart disease some types of cancers as well\nAnd ... Spain is doing quite well out is those good lifestyle behaviors so if the good old fashioned Mediterranean diet but also lower smoking raises one of the things that keeps them ahead of Japan which has a [noise] a slightly high smoking right particularly in men enough how Spain has managed to leave the table\nAnd his life expectancy still rising in most countries whether or not that high middle income countries\nWill globally they're expecting a full point for ... increase in life expectancy over the next decade and a bit\nHowever it is a mixed picture and you could get a lot of rich countries making a huge amounts of progress places like Japan simple staying in Switzerland or going to have life expectancies over eighty five years on average according to this focus but you get other countries Central African republic Zimbabwe\nSomalia so so all under sixty five years so what you're seeing is\nThe water is being progress being made a huge gap in between the poorest and the richest countries isn't closing and this report also has a warning that what is it tends to do is work out what the best case scenario and the worst case scenario is for life expectancy in the coming decades\nAnd it says that in his worst case scenario if things go quite badly wrong than half of countries around the world could actually see the life expectancy folding so during the spring but living in the mid to late eighties as a done deal Cody\nAnd specifically for this hypothesis he started going from the children and we saw smiles who use mitigation how strong your risk of developing a B C D\nSo it could be that it's the it's the medication that's contributing to that it's hard to know what to do about that isn't it because they need to take the medication in order to not have the ...\nWell we're just need to know if ... and I did good treatment of fast my kind of reviews the trajectory downward obesity\nAnd we can expand our knowledge of the potential ... obesity and if we have enough information than we can better targeted individually ... children for example dated interventions ... reaching the auction downsides us for example during indict pattern\nOr Fiji got like a DVD interventions and we can uh let's say advise the parents and the families ... children and their feces ends\nOn how to help us not the job done to grow up and to prevent the obesity epidemic in this children\nIs it possible that as something else going on and that's the same children who have asthma also more likely to be a base and that is that some other reasons some other association going home\nYes I mean in terms of the biological mechanisms we know for example that the most prominent biological mechanisms that could explain the observers who see Asian any systemic inflammation\nWe know that the alterations in Libya metabolism ordering got microbiology and also among pathogenic mechanism for us my obesity\nAnd also we should take into account that the interplay between us men obesity is a vicious cycle because of these children with asthma have usually increased symptom medication use an ass nexus invasions should these two conditions are\nLinked very well together and we should understand the cause of direction between them\nSo what do you think needs to happen next to be able to pin down exactly what's happening when do you need to follow people up for I didn't have twenty is\nYeah we have them going start is with long your follow up and a ... I'm going to the ... research project comprised of most people cohorts in the United states\nAnd in this project we want to replicate these findings because you know the European study is the largest one that we have left now but we know we have to determine let's say weather area onset asthma and other off my related ... for example to reunite these or an exam I increased their risk of childhood obesity\nAnd also to investigate whether factors like ... to do or sleep duration in us my children no physical activity or said they did it behaviors or diets\nCould modify these associations show us to design the best interventions that is\nNeeded shot see now change before we go after ... on a new type of come dome which lubricate ... self ultimately said house is different from a normal lubricate she called them\nWell this takes the basically to calm them I'm going to be outside is a poem or a kind of chemical and what it does is it's very good uh current thing moved to so that when it's exposed water\nAll to see the jungle for then went to visit it attracts about ... to it and it stays on the surface of the ... that for making it very slippery and duplicate\nSo the ... not actually and missing anything itself\nYou know missing anything but it's been designed in such a way that it can grab moisture from its surroundings and that full retain lubrication and the theory is according to their such as the\nTested it is that it will remain slippery for much longer than either ... or lubricate to call them and they think it would last around a thousandth rough for about sixteen minutes according to them of sexual performance and that is more than twice as long as the average\nCouple and they now they say it's backed by the bill and Melinda Gates foundation is not because it's hoped that this will help prevent the transmission disease\nIt isn't potentially deadly diseases like HIV but also those how long term life from consequences like syphilis or herpes\nNow I really liked this approach because rather than somebody being very kind of like pumping and saying you must use condoms because the really good for sites that can prevent some spurts infections that goes with one of the reasons people don't use condoms and the challenges\nBut some people would say is make sexist pleasurable and this was about trying to challenge that try to improve called them so they can be more pleasurable joining in\nSchools and then seeing if I can actually increase company so I actually think he's really clever approach that uses human behavior Robin fights against it\nAnd get the same principle have other medical applications as well\nWell it's already being used or something similar is already being used in some things like instead of being a urine re catheter said by cutting the coaching on the outside than it makes inserting that guy with a more comfortable for the patients so yes this I mean there is proving to be popular in other fields as well\nThank you very ... for taking time to talk to us today and thanks to the chase it had on a Saturday I Am I'm ... and do subscribe for free to the house ... ... if you'd like it to appear on your device every week as a financial\nNext week we'll be hearing from the teams in San Francisco taking addiction cat out to the people by now\nYou're listening to end up news from Colorado Public radio on Ninety point one FM Casey of our Denver fourteen Ninety am Casey fc Boulder on H.

industrial period sprawled over more than a thousand square kilometers in area and was characteristic of a particular kind of low density urbanism which was\n[noise] popping up in the tropical world in the first millennium the common era an uncle was I think probably the biggest those on the largest city on it at that time\nA thousand square kilometers I mean yeah in far off ... London or daily it's today\nYeah that's right it's enormous by any standard in in comparison with for example London during the same time period it was a monster of a city and how many people that's an excellent question and effectively unanswerable because we simply don't have the historical fidelity to answer that but the estimates range from seven hundred and fifty thousand up to ... million\nBut again those numbers are very rubbery and it really depends he took\nTo what everyone agrees on was this open a gray area and since he was sustained by an enormous in critical network of ... miles ultimately the weak point the damn penny has been studying\nIt's an interesting system when you look at it the water distribution network achieved several things with a multifunctional network\nIn Maine was providing irrigation water to agricultural fields of course and also domestic water supply but it also played a role in mitigating flooding in the city\nSo a large volumes of water was starting enormous reservoirs some of which were sixteen square kilometers in area the single reservoir on and storing many millions of cubic meters of water so these systems which fed those reservoirs and the canals which captured surface water flow\nWere designed all such and mitigate the risk of flooding in what is it very seasonal environment so this was critical infrastructure to the functioning and flows of the city when I was active\nAnd am I right but what you be looking at is the ... that infrastructure played that in the demise of this extraordinary civilization\nYeah that's right I think we need to make an important distinction here in the sense that we're not talking about the demise of a civilized nation but rather the fragmentation of into the network\nCertainly what we expected for some time is this very large and very complex system was severely damaged by flooding in the latter part of the fourteenth century and we know that in some way to kill I did with that period of extreme climate variability during the fourteenth fifteenth centuries\nI mean we have long suspected that the functioning of the critical infrastructure that was represented by this would've distribution network was somehow interrupted and that led to sexual outcome that we said let's say the relocation at the Capitol\nI mean it's a very interesting phrase somewhere in your paper about cascading failure so it sounds like some parts of the system was pushed over the edge of men they bought it off ...\nYeah I think the cascade is critical to this argument and that's what we saw to determine precisely whether they would be a cascading assistant given setting conditions when\nWe are all very familiar with these things as we experienced them as blackouts in various infrastructure all networks that we rely on his part of a daily lives\nAnd so effectively the argument here is that you can have a very small disruption to one component of the system which can then propagate out very rapidly to create a much larger outage that may be network wider release tech how large parts of it were effectively compromising its core function\nSo you're saying it's a bit like when the electric power system goes down it might be just one link that goes down and then it brings the rest and you'll say but one Lincoln this canal network march of gone than others followed\nYeah to exactly right and it's precisely like a a power outages the very small disruption which might be simple as an overload switching station somewhere can actually create a problem which may be much much much larger and more significant\nSo you say that there was an overload of some salt related to these monsoons\nYeah precisely said the ... talking about in the system is not an electrical obviously but it relates to a period of a particularly wet monsoons during the latter part of the fourteenth and nearly Fifteen centuries which sits between two very large in prolonged drought so this was a period of\nQuite dramatic climatic instability so the evidence to the damage created by these floods these are the ... as you say is very clear and the landscape very easily measured what we wanted to know was does that damage ... system\nAnd I'm just sort of try and work out how it would do what would the failure of one come out have in terms of the whole network of canals\nYeah it's an interesting question that relates to a feedback between erosion which you might expect in a flood situation and said imitation which you might not necessarily expect so al model estimated the dynamics of erosion instead of ... in these canals systems given a certain magnitude of flooding\nWhat we found was if you're putting more water down the canal which is not designed for it\nYou will trigger incision and that's precisely what we see in the remains of the network a single canal a writing down into its paid several nations in doing so begins to style of flow from other parts of the network\nIn of course ... there's a feedback between erosion and said I'm In ... in a concentration of flow into a single pathway through the network\nEffectively stopping most of the network of water a day by fracturing the system breaking it into a small compact switching no longer functioning I think it's\nPretty amazing that this cascade of events could bring to its knees the great if if you're on the climate\nAnd indeed and it's an interesting question whether this was the act that caused that shift from on cost to the cycle middle period cities closer to load and capital of ...\nOr whether this was simply the final event mocking the end of a city which was becoming increasingly unwieldy and increasingly irreparable so it's an interesting question whether this was the ... or whether it was simply the event that broke a system there was no longer being maintained\nThen penny from the University of Sydney his analysis up here this week in science advances links on our Web page at BBC

resistance to bullshit Cardiff University he's an expert in detecting the development and spread of new resistance mechanisms in bacteria\nOnce they get resistance mechanisms they become very difficult to treat and we're left with a few chemical treatment options wonderfully cheese can list and quite frankly there are very few options clinically we have left\nAnd so it's extremely precious resource quite frankly technically speaking so to be using it on farms is just quite frankly bones because\nOf course we'll start seeing animals need not be a human problem if it stays on the phone

social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't ... yourself a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes\nThe character of the conversation that's being had on line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a tendency toward predation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more woke\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth to white identity politics\nIt the ... that actually is destroyed\nIf there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf there isn't that enough it is one that has been set up by the majority this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nSet protests them all in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim narratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that no loss of ... which is outrageous\nThough is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads believing abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people on the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to dodge and nothing none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim on whether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue message or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat are real victims those real oppression mixed protection\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we

I Want to move away from that\nPoint and bring you in Adrian we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the established policies\nActually has no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should you not like\nThe [noise] I mean it's a big uh issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites do you stop and Sherman simply on representative that often very smooth any groups\nOften watch groups but then other groups which actually then bring about the system is unjust almost a father why people and many more so it's not the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot ... wide working class populations in certain countries I've simply not being the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all the kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last forty years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that place um I like the W.
