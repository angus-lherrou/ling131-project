financial crisis highlights the extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy who'd students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class what we're seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crashing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there was similar a sense of students being very complex and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics Tom says a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christian is with a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well you know was studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that ... is\nFact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession had become Wendy colon isn't also widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books missed on subjects that we usually imports\nSome in terms of understanding the crunch things as basic as how find them works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting\nAnd there was no section on banks all the financial system and this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world and has that changed\nIt has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true not just the opposite of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms\nRemember these are the people who graduate and go on to steal the financial systems in which we all depend\nIf they get bad advice can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt by students and their teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the court charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum being\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cool to to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's models allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\n\nAnd that's a much easier economics professor at Stanford University in the

us much more talent to make it very plain and I think there's every reason to think that the subject will become even more vibrant even more\nPromising as a way of taxing the really big problems that we face [noise]\n\nSince the financial crisis there's been a healthy soul searching in economics the growing number of people in organizations have been pointing out the obvious froze and developing alternative views to better understand and improve the way the economy's work\nHas actually had an impact with masters\nCountry must so there's there's some evidence that it's not just lip service

worked at the obesity the organization for economic cooperation and development I can vouch for this progress which is also reflected in the ... and equality and it's and the bank of England's welcome climate change\nI've seen firsthand how much economics has changed since two thousand and eight new perspectives different ways of teaching and far more of a move towards understanding how crushes come about\nThe good news is that there's been some progress the bad news is that this is not filtered through what he's done in the financial sector impacted on policy makers\nI Believe that the best way to make sure those in power will hold their ideas about economics is for us all to get involved\nThere's a saying economics is too important to be left to the economists if we were all more

economic literacy\nJust like to statistics what politics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn it means we can better understand the world around us and we'll be better informed and more able to speak out about big national decisions such as regarding migration and trade\nWhen do you call them as citizens across the whole range of jobs especially journalists me to take more interest in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history\nAnd a better understanding of how different countries operate\nIs going to provide much broader basis of understanding so that when something new tens up like the threat of trade was then the kind of resonance the idea that somehow that they had been tried was before that they hadn't had serious economic consequences\nIn the Nineteen thirties that can have a resonance with people with a broader public\n[noise]\nMy hope it's a great economic literacy will make our government's more accountable for the economic decisions they take which impact on our lives improving economics will only make a difference if those in power taking

to comply with European rules of the original plan put forward was considered unaffordable and now the European Commission has demanded to see a new budget by mid day or else uh they've why doesn't Russell's like Italy spending plans\nA couple of reasons the number one reason is equally wants to spend money it doesn't have the second reason is that would break\nThe rules in the eurozone about how much debt you're allowed to have so you might remember earlier in the year is really had an election a couple of new ... formed a coalition in both parties made a lot of spending promises to get elected now they're in power and trying to honor those promises but to pay for all that they have to raise the amount of money the government borrowed\nAnd compared to the previous plan that the previous government had\nA government barring a that amount is a lot bigger and that's why process isn't very impressed\nAnd the problem is how enormous the national debt already easily a break some rules does it\nYes and he said no country should have debt that's worth more than sixty percent of its GDP or its annual national income unfortunately usually has more than twice that amount of debt it has a debt to GDP ratio of a hundred and thirty percent or two point six trillion dollars\nNow the Italian government says it will increase gross that means uh when it comes to borrowing this money because his GDP will increase\nThe ratio to debt will decrease because they'll have more money but the problem with everything I can easily as I had from Nicholas ... economic spectra\nIs that you know that the Enron\nGrowth has been slow and has been lower in the last I Would say Fifteen to Twenty years\nThese government to claim said that that is new budget or that the uh contains a lot of additional spending will be financed by our young girls\nAnd did you succeed him down likely in fact the bank could be the ... the main thing that the uh the growing age that that was already sluggish are you so or as slowing down even farther\nAnd on top of that the economic uh toward the economic environment is definitely not positive and this means that the the outlook for the economy is negative so I Would say that that is likely that the doctor said that uh will beat a larger a he said the government among the and the promises has made what\nDo you expect to happen today than at midday who's got it back down here in Brussels\nI think nobody's going to back down and I think the government will stick with the with the budget so we didn't plan and we try to find a clash with the European institution\nIs a populist government to that uh uh is high and get the next to European elections in the spring\nAnd there is a finding domestic popular support to buy a showing that you can
