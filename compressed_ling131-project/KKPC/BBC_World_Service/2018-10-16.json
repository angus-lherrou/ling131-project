been secrets comes from being a journalist [noise] journalism is all about exposing the truth and making a base of the scenes in that exchange which is why open secrets fascinate me why do people keep them I'm well it was an ecosystem enables them to exist ...\nIn what seems to be interesting about open secrets relative to let's say normal secrets is a typical secret is primarily kept by a single person\nMichael ... is a professor of management at Columbia Business school he's done research into the secrets people keep and it's also developed a theory of secrecy\nYou know you've done something that you don't want people to know about or had an experience that you'd rather keep to yourself\nAnd you're sort of the primary gatekeeper that secret\nNo if there's something like an open secret whereas say there's something happening in your workplace and you know a lot of people are aware of maybe not everyone in for the same reason we're not talking about it 'cause it'll all blow up or not we tried multiple gatekeepers where any person could speak up any person could sort of blow the whistle but they don't\nEnd well stops people from doing that\nAnd I think people are sort of fear the backlash that might happen if someone's trying to rock the boat even for the right reasons I think a lot of people sort of don't want to be in that position where they're the ones who sort of changed things um because things probably get worse before they get better\nA lot of times there's a good person versus the good for the group\nThat's communications professor Sondra pitcher and yet in her career at Indiana University she's also specialize in how people reveal secrets\n\nShe did research with the children who had suffered sexual abuse to find out how they disclosed in she says people may ... both before they break committed in secret and ... [noise]\n\nThe open secret idea is I think are really important one\nMight give people in a family knew that there was one member and that was sexually abusing wanted their children and family\nAnd they didn't deal with it then it's a problem for the entire family they know about the abuse but they're in denial they don't necessarily want to take on responsibilities like that because then\nIf their husband is a perpetrator and person wanted to marriage be salvaged\nThen they would be lots of complications about the decision to disclose sent they even knew that this was going on\n\nAt Tony Mitchell Garabedian is based in Boston in the U.S he spent decades representing victims of sexual abuse including cases of sexual abuse at the hands of the ...\nThe chosen not to talk with each other they would call pre certain names and say stay away from so and so I was staying away from five to ... stay away from many priests that they would have nicknames they would shy away from the previous they would tell each other and code\nMe too that fits uncovering the open secret of priests abusing children in Boston was made into an Oscar winning film called spotlight\nThe movie shows a community what everyone knew something was happening but it was all kept under the covers\n\nIn the case against the priest junkie Reagan\nMe to reach the financial settlement with the Boston archdiocese on behalf of eighty six people as I said the million dollars he also ensured that plaintiffs wouldn't have to sign non disclosure agreement during his time with clients he observes how this type in secret was present\nBecause there's such a stigma and society developing sexually abused it's really a very very big stigma\nThere was not much talk about a person being sexually abused amongst parents or a child being sexually abused because there was such an attitude of well you're going to be punished for the rest of your life you're going to be tattooed\nWith this negative image for the rest of your life let's not talk about it\n\nBut why is that being such a culture of secrets regarding sex abuse in the Catholic Church\nWhen a child is sexually abused by priests that child who respects the priests who was taught that the priest voice is the voice of God on earth\nThat child is threatened by the ... the child is told by a priest if you tell anybody about the sexual abuse your parents who Vernon tell your parents will get divorced or you be kicked out of school and the child beliefs that\nAnd then when the heritage reports the sexual abuse\nTo a a pastor a monsignor of fish of the pastor or the ... health the parents\nFor the sake of the church because the church does such great things and the church is God's representative on earth you must keep this quiet you must keep it secret and we'll take care of the matter don't worry about in the ... belief that\nAlthough ways in which people in the community what sort of cover up\nOh yeah I mean when I filed\nMy first cases involving digging a clerk looked at me and said I go to St Andrews church parish it's about time somebody that is\nThe community just kept the matter quiet because they were so involved with the Catholic religion\nWe have a concept here in the United states called cradle Catholic that's a family that is so Catholic and there are many cradle Catholics who put the needs of the church before the needs of their own family and their\nSo if you have a dollar and you don't have any food in the church wants that dollar you give the church that dollar that's called the cradle Catholic\nThat brings us back to Sondra paternity his idea of acting for the benefit of the great rather than the yourself\nA lot of times there's a good fit that person versus the good for the group\nThis is seen and other arenas two\nSometimes describe my role as teaching middle aged men the difference between lying and telling the truth\nJoe guarantee as both in by banks to combat the problems that can result juice to teams having open secrets\nWe can kind of say well this is a lie and this is telling the truth you know why is that okay it's pretty black and white why the shades of gray and they will come with that shades of gray which will be well either everybody else is doing it I thought it was someone else's responsibility to report this if it's not like I don't see is my responsibility\nYou know people have been doing this for a long time you know nobody's ever said to us that we can't do it my manager doesn't I'm very loyal to my manager I think this is the right thing for the company\nJoe guarantee has seen many grey areas in the finance industry\nMight be you know it's kind of ... of the profit and loss on a daily basis that I think what it is okay because I'll I'll correct that before they went into but it's actually going to look at ...\nOr maybe telling clients that they filled and order some price when that wasn't strictly\nTrue but everybody does it it it's very common ... I might slightly more money on this deal than the client thinks I did it's not even technically illegal not permissible it's just not completely ethical either so why do people keep secrets\n[laughter] um that's a very big question I think there are lots of different ... and I think the main pieces\nWe're trying to model this process of economic growth it is obvious to everybody that involves technical progress in both doing things better\nNow before Obama everybody knew that but nobody could produce a mathematical model\nThat describes that process Rodman was the person\nWho was able to make the equations work so that you could describe a Muslim ...\nIndividual companies have an incentive to spend money on research and development and those incentives could be\nImproved over juiced and how that would only interact and produce a Muslim ... economic growth happens\nIt wasn't the idea that I did matter it was actually making it work in the language that economists on stand that breakthrough paper was Nineteen Ninety\nHaving done that he basically quit academia and he said yeah I'm done with this this is fine I have written this pay for everyone's hasn't really got the Nobel Prize a hamster cameras down there really was like that we got everyone did cite that will win the Nobel Prize\nYou set up an online learning company called a clear this is before online learning was cool he sold the company I think it might cost\nThe money he then had an even bigger idea he said the keel to go to like an immigrant fist there are places that don't have a stable institutions and rules and norms build a building someone's going to come and ask you for a bribe although knock it down you can't take disputes to court\nThere's no functioning banking system and so you've got countries that are incredibly pool but lots and lots and entrepreneurial activity but like they can't develop how can we solve a problem\nRomer says we need a new Hong Kong Hong Kong is this little place on the coast of China which has British imperial rules\nThose rules were very successful and Hong Kong becomes this tremendous economic success story and then becomes a gateway for China as China stops to reform so he says well what can we do that again\nI'm ... I'm not a whole lot of ... the same rules because what really\nMade the difference with the rules if you have the rules right and that credible you got the right institutions\nYou can do it all again and China was doing this in cities all along the coast but what about an African country for example where does this really troubled history of colonialism and then the post colonial governments have often been very corrupt no democratic so ... and this is a super controversial idea romanticized\nWhy doesn't say Mauritania contract out a little bit of swam to Canada and say Canada we're on the first place is not what if anything to us but it might be worth something if Canada set up all the rules\nAnd than anyone in Mauritania could emigrate to little chunk of Canada kind of their own rules it's not colonialism because no one has to go there is no compulsion and then maybe we get a new Hong Kong\nI mean you can eat ... I can see why that could go horribly wrong\nIt could go horribly wrong you and you could see why a lot of people would find it offensive but you can't accuse the guy of not having any ambition oh unfold on coal he went to the world bank as chief economist going into arguments with basically every other economists will back he's not a diplomat\nIn the end he said you know what I'm going to go back to academia just in time to collect Nobel Prize very interesting character\nSome people listening might turn around is frustrating because some people say well economic growth is the whole problem with the planet yeah yeah and climate change is an issue because we just keep producing more and more and more and it's not sustainable\nYeah well I have a lot of sympathy with that about my sympathy is limited by sheer completely mind opening paper that we didn't know what House produced in the Nineteen nineties he says what about like what about illumination\nHow much does it cost us to illuminate room back in the day you have to jump down a tree and set fire to the tree the very inefficient way to like to ... and no one has actually did this ... would chop wood set fire to the woods and sat there with a minolta liked me to measuring how much light came off the campfire and how long it lasted\nThan he did the same with an antique oil um Roman Babylonian something like that and he fills it with olive oil and calculates how long would it take to produce the olive oil how long would it be done for\nThis because the whole history of trying to like to room through to the incandescent light bulb which at the beginning very expensive very unreliable kept lowering\nIt gets better it gets better it gets better trucks whose whole story so at the beginning if you were a good hard day's work that would give you enough to lie to room for ten minutes but by the end of his practice my dad was hunting century\nA day's work gives you not ten minutes to the looming nation gives you ten years if a limitation no progress that is probably best one of the implications of that those experiment is\nLife can keep getting better and better and better we don't need to go back to the stone age to deal with climate change we are smart enough to solve the problem if we direct our intelligence in our creativity at the problem rather than something else\nCan we be hearing from you can see I Hope so I'm sure Ken Offit on ten more about William note houses like experiment you can download fifty things made the modern economy episode light bulb what do you get your podcasts from\nNow so we have time for all this week he smoked anything it's that they climb out up please\nDo get in touch our email address is more or less apt to BBC don't see I don't eat ...\nThis is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one FM case for Denver fourteen Ninety am Casey of sea Boulder on H.

Rosenbaum of Northwestern University in Chicago\nSo what we found is that the males who spent the most time what we call affiliating which in this particular case means grooming and resting in contact\nWith the incidence in that group are also the males who ended up firing the most insects and this was definitely not something we expect that this is not a monogamous feces the males don't seem to discriminate between their infants and the defense of other males a and yet in spite of that it appears that it may have some sort of benefit for them\nSo what you're speculating is at the mall paternal ... the guerilla is the more females choose to mate with gorilla\nYes so that's our speculation we can't prove causation yet um we are working are coming up with some ideas to try to test a alternative possibilities for this\nRight now we think that the most plausible explanation is that the females prefer to mate with those nails in particular\nUm why wouldn't they because they want to help us I mean that's the kind of like a rather blunt sort of I suppose a human way of looking at it but what could be the ones do they look ... do they know to the ... between the father and the child does the father only bummed with his own child will just she bummed with more children in the guerilla group\nShe doesn't seem to bond only with his own kid so we published a paper a couple of years ago that showed that they don't seem to discriminate between their infants and other males and fence\nIt's hard for me to believe that the mothers don't notice that you know they they pay attention to what's going on around them um we don't know exactly why female should prefer this in a species aware it's not exactly clear what mail carrier is getting them\nBut what we're speculating right now is that perhaps this is basically a signal that males are giving to females that when the need arises for them to do something really important like protect infants that they're willing to do it and this is how they show females that one\nThing I'm I'm intrigued by is the the mothers will obviously be involved in specifically maternal I imagine ... kind of thing when we when we save the males have a strong paternal row house strongly about or they just like washing the dishes once a month to say [laughter]\nSo what are the things it's very striking when you study mountain gorillas as any time you are around males you are also around infants so from the time that instance art all old enough to be moving around independently from their mothers\nMales adult males specifically are seem to be there other preferred adult companion\nSo males do a lot of um what we have colloquially call babysitting or in the literature but they also do a lot of behaviors like playing with them wrestling with them grooming them a resting and contact which is basically the equivalent of sort of sitting on somebody's lap if you're a human\nUm are sitting right next to someone on a couch I'm you know certainly the amount of care taking that they do is nothing compared to the females but again for a mammal it's incredibly unusual and it's really hard not to watch this behavior and to see something in it that looks a lot like what we see in humans a\nDutch was going to be my last question when you'll that watching in the wild\nObviously you're watching as a scientist but surely some of you is sort of tracking across in sinking in human terms what this would be looked like ... what this would look like I mean you mentioned sitting on the sofa does it sometimes look to you that they are sitting side by side on the sofa or sitting in dad's lap\nAbsolutely yes it is impossible you know yes of course you're you're a scientist and you're trying to be as objective about this as you can but you know you wouldn't be human if you didn't see some sort of parallel and it really does look like the sorts of view relationships that you see between many fathers and their children\n[noise] um ... amazing not the best jobs in the in the world pretty good at that amazingly would be humans and you can almost a really humans are the best well anyway uh but the grill is a pretty extraordinary and those I should say all the mountain gorillas of Rwanda that are being studied by Stacy Rosenbaum that'd be a good reason diminished\nOr do you enforce these bunch of ...

paper pages\nOf those newspapers without a ... party political background or they consisted of advertisements though it's really played an important role\nForties newspapers and a more over the voice perfectly normal at that time in Vienna to buy an article in the new section so this means that promotion of text book published like news in the form of news um without labeling it\nSo he was raining against the commercialization in an end to corruption as he put it all the newspapers and um I mean today people often pool called currents himself a generalist but his was a very particular type of journalism\nUm he was in a unique position and he was able to edit and publish his own magazine de facto which means the torch\nIt runs the thirty seven years it totaled nine hundred and twenty two additions is about six million words and that editorial independence they hadn't been he was not beholden to any special interests beat a political or commercial but tell me seem on how unique was grounds his independence\nWell just a hug with um ... financially independent because he inherited a lot of money from his wealthy father on Austen's Jewish paint them in effect or a cold um y'all could cause\nThese means that cows did not have to ride for another paper it didn't have to become a traditional journalist and get paid for delivering news to save for a newspaper but apart from this financial independence I think it's more important to emphasize\nThat kills both really independent in an ideological a sense of what I mean is that he both never really ideological if you understand\nThis tone up by I'm thinking about people who are totally fixed into political ... views so he in this sense in this political sense evil is never ideological at all\nAnd I suppose when you do that had not being ideological incensed that does that reflects hidden sometimes seeming contradictory as well I think an end to be fat when he was doing wasn't vanity publishing the the magazine often sold between thirty and forty thousand copies brutish and\nAnd and it typically shocked termed sentence Crouse commented on ... plus as\nI my public understand each other very well it does not hear what I say and I don't say what it wants to hear [noise]\nNow ... study publishing de facto in Eighteen Ninety nine of the spin of working as an actor and a journalist for other publications I'm already tell me what was he playing against in general what motivated him to write\nHe saw most newspapers and most editors not all or I should add but most\nI'm as always beholden to particular interest and so in a sense a when one read something in the newspaper one was not reading news as for cross it sort of ought to be delivered um these are not agents of information is cross I think thinks that are thought that a journalist should be\nRather individuals that were beholden to various political and economic interests and yet this was often disavowed or at least not made explicit and so you know one of crosses\nConstant targets critique I could save the is the inherent sort of your city of journalistic language the way it claims to have some kind of independence\nBut really when pressed or when exposed in different ways shows itself to be either ideological are motivated by economic interests or a more dubious political and that that were not made obvious to the public and so that's certainly one of the main areas of of uh of concern that cross expressed in those riding\nAnd just to be clear in nearly as difficult published not just a cross but also on the original writers from Vienna and beyond but from about Nineteen twelve grams basically divided the contents of the magazine himself\nI no longer have collaborators I used to be envious of them they repel lose readers who might want to lose myself\nCross was less interested in in breaking news stories than in commenting on what others have written as we've mentioned already\nHe would find a piece of a pool report seeing all sloppy language you sort of human folly independent articles of the time and then you take it apart through satirical comments he would often stop by exposing it's absurdity all by simply ... printing the only thing\nHere is an example uh matrimonial advertisement\nWanted a father in law to go into the women's Web business with me I'm twenty three years old and will know who knows the women's west salesman no matchmaking\nAnd that there was no mention of the bride and the advertisers who and they were serious political economic and social issues that the un and the rest of your face of the time so to cross it seem ludicrous that the papers that they would waste column inches and reporters time on mindless entertainment such as this one\nYesterday's competition that the dumb fellow who saw the first prize go to Troy line Louis ... know for the smallest foot to have ... miles from the largest ... prizes will be awarded today for the narrowest ladies waist and the biggest knows\n[laughter] so it would seem that from others make them now\nInjury on from when ... ... there's not much has changed when it comes to the trivia and celebrity typical settled and in what seems like a professor remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed facts and fiction Crouse commented\nThe real truth or those that can be invented\nAnd controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth come to mind\nAnd one can only imagine what he thought through social media and the Internet today but crosswords very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a president\nIt's a complicated question as many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare gr attuned Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that I'm the same age as the misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In a relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it simply cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think are writing properly and crosses my crummy many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to an editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability\nOr to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for cross his own indication that there is something deeply arise in the morality of the author or more likely\nOr one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of crosses more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floor pros juxtaposed against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing as he is exposing some of the ideological underpinnings\nThat are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this has kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate sloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and these other schools are solutions to classic works of Jim and the ... and Shakespeare as you said and he will say continue the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a truce or principle you've heard a few of these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published them in book fool several times but he himself was aware of the limitations\nAnd ... other coincides with the tricks it is either a ... year old woman to half truths\nAnd I think he was kind of shocked to see people celebrating and thinking this will be ... nothing much will happen\nHe did at first ... probably also hoping that it wouldn't last too long and maybe it yeah it would still be over\nAnd he also I think he needed some time to find a position for which to speak because of course they didn't and so easy the whole nation is celebrating its pointing to when you're thinking ... [laughter]\nSo he had first declared that he wouldn't be silent he would just remain silent and not say anything [noise]\nDescendants had that did not last very long and only a few months later crossed a lady decided that he would published if I take an aunt that he would take a stance against\nTheir will cross also thought that the press was implicated in starting the war\nHow is the world rule didn't lead to all\nDiplomats liked to journalists and believe these lives when they see them in print those you know that's a general observation but what will cross his main objections to the way that the Austrian press was reporting on the ...\nFoot ... votes Maine to an amplifier and all the problems of look down at the same is true for the press or the ... the press problem and this problem for coal is lost from the beginning\nThat the press is not reporting they are not reporting fix their not establishing fix that they have spreading opinions movements rumors\nAnd yes it was particularly skating wasn't the of some of the the war reporters who instead of concentrating on ... has a ... ... soldiers inane questions and in fact here is how crowds immortalized one such ... in his play the last days of mankind\nAlso didn't come on to slide off thank\nThank you so\nHow ... makes his report quite sure I Am with a fever I think it's made and this cat and thinking about what are your feelings [noise]\n\nAnd that's from a radio version of the last days of mankind dramatized by Giles half ago [noise]\nUm crafts began writing the play and about Nineteen fifty and it turned out to be a mammoth undertaking some seven hundred pages whereabouts ten evening's performance is\nClearly it's impossible to give a show somebody something so long and complex but I Would tell me give us an idea of what Trump is trying to do here and how he's doing it\nIt's important to probably first emphasize that nearly half of this play consist although I don't think it's ever been determined the exact amount but nearly half consists of actual quotations that\nCross lifted from either newspapers or from conversations that eventually overheard on the streets of Vienna or in the cafes where he spends his days and I say this because this fact has led to some commentators to call this play something of a documentary play which is not entirely an accurate description\nKraus is definitely documenting the war in words we could say\nAnd in part because I'm Simone and Katrina have established the journalists who were supposed to be doing this we're not for the most part just crossed saw they were swept up in the nationalist fervor that cross identified as something of a of a kind of collective pathology\nAnd so Kraus has um we could call them an alter ego in the play the grumble or\nWho maintains a running dialogue with his dialogue partner the optimist who is presented as a much more naive figure than than a malicious figure 'em and and I say this because the optimist\nTends to be someone who kind of reproduces newspaper headlines and he takes their content at face value so he doesn't have really any critical dimension to his his audience is\nAnd this is precisely across this point that what was counting or what constituted is healthy commonsense over which of course the newspaper editors held dominion was the very problem and the play we could say puts on open display the actual motives of the war is cross saw them profit\nNationalistic muscle flexing techno mania we might call it\nAn romantic ideology in this kind of mixture and cross would say you know the collusion between among these impulses is what led to and what perpetuated the war\nIf I could also maybe reduced the drama to another crucial inside and and as you said reducing this drama to any you know number of insights would be a kind of insult to the to the complexity and just to the massive undertaking that it was but it would be best that crosses\nAstonishment that an entire civilization appeared willing to destroy itself in part because of the new media technology so not only the press but in this case also film and photography which play roles in the in the play\nHave made it actually possible to become a spectator to one's own self destruction and cross actually write something of this sort in the sort of the forward I actually even prior to the place prologue cross I Would say prefer to be a witness not a spectator\nSo either way you could say it's a kind of ... of a mountain they dumped the drama isn't it that that play 'em ... took about tightening mania and as with so many things that can cause that's due to technology will as complex he likes the convenience of something like a ... but he also dislike the noise and the ... they created\nContradictions a would seem to be run through his his life there again he also felt that fun too often technology was not being employed well and as far back as Nineteen weights he rose complicated enough to build\nInto primitive to make themselves across clean he just bad of the war and the ... of humanity that exposed as he observes the devil is an optimist if he thinks he can make people mean\nOff the horror and ... of the wall came the dissolution of the Austria Hungarian and planned this happened a hundred years ago in October and November of Nineteen Eighteen telling me already what was crowned says reaction I mean after all his native country what his great love seed money still resigned as\nIt became independent Czechoslovakia\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to something Katrina said early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than\nProbably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy has actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to become a actually arguably it's most ardent critic\nUm I Would actually argue that cross as the war was dragging on especially to not only really anticipate the outcome of it was but that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and what you saw was holy and moral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually ... who is the war on its subjects in the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called a quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually in the stall jak\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so process sort of again you know it's kind of enlightenment\nUm attack trying to connect the dots are better than they were actually being connected by many of

and this is about men and women issue I was quite surprised that they didn't even start or even filed a case\nSo she or he was this the first police officers that you spoke to\nIt was my first time to

she told me well you have to go to the different PlayStation because the east and what had happened was in a different area so I have to talk to three police men to start with [noise]\nIt was very painful experience to tell the same story over and over and I remember when I first went to college I was just crying and I couldn't\nEven talk much us I start realizing that I have to repeat it in the tell my story I have to find\nTheir way to be able to tell this painful experience over and over and the way I guess I discovered to be able to tell is to think I'm reporting about one case and this had happened to this girl so I tried\nYou think as a third party sort person and I think that is how I mentally Monday she did\nKnow sure his post as investigation you say you ought to act out what happened to you tennis above that\nYes so during the investigation they asked me to we enact and\nThey took me to one of the room and there were three male voice men around me and they asked me

later you actually decided to go public that is to reveal your name and your face to the Japanese press y\nTo be honest what had happened to me was shocking but even what was more shocking was when I have to go through that afterwards going through this in the ... meant and\nI start questioning about how little support we have here in Japan for sex crime victims so in our apartment it was about time for them to talk about\nReformation of our rape though and I felt strongly that I Need to talk about what we need to change and also I discovered how difficult in how to boost to talk about rape itself in Japanese media and\nIt was hard to talk about my own story but um that was the only way I had left\nSure like to come to talk about source to booze and Japanese society in a moment but I should say that ... she denies medications and\nYou follow the civil case against him and miss the AMA Grucci is defending the civil case\nThat's the case is very different what made you decide to find a lawsuit against you form of both in twenty sixteen\nSewing to solving success said I was ... from very high profile producer in Georgia\nSo he was making sexual advances toward you yeah favors yeah sexual favors could you explain to us what was the working environment at the TV station ... was it like for you you know working within that environment\nSo Georgia societies like struggling with all the gender inequality and sexual misconduct and famous side at femi side that's when women and girls are killed by men yeah so sexism in every environment is not a big deal\nSo he's tough person she's like ferry sexiest he was always like commenting ... sexual comments\nFor me before realizing that this was very unfair environment for quite normal I was just like you can ... comments and trying to do my job\nBecause you know we all need to our job and we don't want to live job because this about economic struggle rehab in Georgia\nSo what made you then still picking the warring these comments and then decided to actually make a recording of him because he says\nBecause he was asking for thanked him I said towards nuts comments anymore she was asking for sexual favors from me regarding guy was striking to lost my job\nSo they saw the last moment ... realized I was in trouble they saw such kind of formulation and they're supposed to return so unfair\nSo tight just cruise notes being a silence and do nothing so of course I denied it and I went to court civil rights cards\nSo he said if you didn't give him the sexual favors he ... he was in most of your job yeah and as I understand that the new news against sexual harassment in Georgia so how did you go about bringing this case the court\nYeah there's no particular like it's ... sexual misconduct ... job but we have this odd to discriminate law where we have this part of sexual misconduct toward women\nSo with cooperation Cohen Joes we was ice case also my case was before me to kind of pain and ... to campaign each was tied to fly sink and car is very sensitive institution\nI Do believe that to my story or presents hundreds of odds are women star race here in Georgia\nSo sometimes when I have a challenge to stay alive I Do think that type ... writes\nSeeing to speak cops because there are a lot of women who cannot speak up when they are looking up to me and say you're like praying for me to become survivor\nNo to a victim and I feel like I'm a survivor because I could to fight back it was so me to come pay nice trying from my perspective to bring ... back to women\nAnd took it do you think things are evolving in Georgia all things changing at all\nYeah I Do I ... I think because we have high profile made the eye and political discussions here in Georgia ... sexual\nHarassment and family side and all the problems we have like women's issues in Georgia so I Do think that to me to campaign was very influential\nNo totally New America but also in Georgia\nAnd what would you like to see in a test phase one complete change you'd like to see happen what would that be first of all I Would\nLike to see the ... law against sexual harassment because I Know a lot of women has the programming commercial secretary so this is number one problem we have to solve here in Georgia or knowledge ice\nEnsuring what would you like to see happen in Japan\nThere are so many things that I should change\nSex without consent and rape here in Japan so to prove it was great we have to prove how much we been violated or threatened so that still it's remained and that it didn't change last year so that's something he has to change\nYeah same here in Georgia as well oh wow\nLike can we talk about where you Korea's on now can I lost touch it the fact that you no longer working as the during this was that a choice or was that something that happened because he couldn't find work anymore because he's spoken out\nI actually I could manage I was like openly discriminate too darn many drop interviewers and I can like feel he's paying to everywhere silver rubbish funny that you're talking about yeah I'm Talking about him he's very influential men with contracts in government\nBut could you be sure that it was as a result of he influencing your ability to get a job or was it maybe not just because you can get the job\nI can say for sure and missing but this is my opinion about that\nAnd surely we're now in your career so you've written a book and you're working outside of Japan for me need to national media what are you hoping to do\nWhat I'm working on right now is to tell the story of what it is like to be a victim of rape [noise]\nSo I Wish to tell the story so they can understand and I especially here in Japan there is just a little understanding of what it's what can happen mentally\nPsychologically there if there is no understanding for that part I don't think police would ask survivor too we and knocked\nTia and they're you know we can you can paint and you're doing all these different things but do you feel that that incident that period of your life is now behind you\nActually I don't I'm Still fighting games the cards but I'm trying to stay positive\nIf it's possible and I'm trying to tie DEA law ... we can send the so house meals so you know way to feel safe cause I feel I'm\nDoing something guy mean next year and so I can say that takes shows their stories behind me there so it's like very tough experience very humiliating experience\nBut I took license from them and I'm trying to develop personnel into something not telling me for my career but also for other women in Georgia you have to ... to ...\n... so if you yeah\nBut you do actually\nSpeaking out for both of you had considerable consequences there was a lot of backlash\nWhich you do it or they can test yeah\nOf course of course I Will do it again and again every time I don't feel like it's my ... pickup I think that it was very brave to do\nYou ask me can't I have no regrets surely untouched yeah thank you both very much thank you so much fish stores she only conversation for me thank you my guests today with the Japanese feed Austin is she or he eat to enjoy watching TV\nDuring this touchy I somehow to say\nThank you for this into the conversation\nThis was Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

its ally and South Korea all societies in which young men might struggle to cook financially\nAnd that you inhale it just keeps getting slash went out that was not sane in about a decade\nAnd ... that's such a huge worry because it's probably a reflection of inflation expectations or anything\nWe mentioned the yield curve field for something that people are talking about a lot how do we know where it is and what are the consequences are being above or below it that's really what people are talking about the the slope of\nWhat the fed does drives the show and the ... the hills and what we see in the coming months with\nThe ... campaign to see\nYeah you wonder why more people to to watch the financial media anyway well they told me about that I have to give it its proper name is the ... kind of a kind of the measures the various interest rates you can get for different kinds of us bull market investments basically\nBecause flattening out which is unusual and it's making some market watches pretty edgy why what is it is just in America it's do what he is co founder of seven investment management to explain\nShe's very simply ... which measures they yield over to new guest on bones over a period of time so it will be going from say one week one month one year five years ten years\nAnd so therefore it's telling you is how much that you are to get to go up on this will be over that period of time and so you can measure all those ... going up for going do and we would expect in a normal economic situation\nAnd that you get a ... on his tenure bombed than on a two year old and would we we don't expect that you would with and she went along she'll building south bank and said I'm going to give you my money for five years in ten years I Would expect to get back to ... but\nSometimes you can get the opposite occurring and that she ends up getting down the longer it is and that's why school didn't Bush who deals cup it's getting the wrong way people get very interested in that because it's old ends up with some strange events they're also\nNot just strange some say the flattening or investing code is pretty terrible in fact some experts reckon inversion deal cubs have successfully foreshadowed each of America's seven recessions over the last fifty years\nWell that's what some say anyway others disagree the fact is it hasn't fully inverted yet unlike old economic indicators it may not be tempted to infallible right now it seems downright implausible to some people the United states is enjoying record low unemployment high record high growth rates for the last decade so\nHow worried should we be his ... an economic acts but\nIt does give out false signals no rule is completely infallible if he was making money from financial markets will be easy and it isn't that easy but I think ... the ... suggesting that the fed will continue to raise rates now but that in the in in the traditional way it will overdo it it will do too much too late\nThat the U.S economy will begin to slow down and in the future it would have to re cans and stop to kill the interest rates and that's really what he's saying\nAnd I think if you do believe in the signal coming from from the yield curve right now what you're really thinking\nIs that the U.S economy although he's doing Britain they now this is as good as he gets under the Trump tax cuts can the wrong time of the cycle putting juicy into the system when he wasn't needed with the result that a un world that's called mall debt now than ever\nHe's going to feel some some pain in the future and if you believe the the deal could that's what you'll frightened all\nRight so basically the U.S consumer will field start to feel overloaded as those interest rates rise and the fed will let you notice this after it's too late\nYeah not just the U.S consumer the consumer as an issue but I think it's actually corporations they've taken the ... since two thousand and seven a loss of it to ... which means a lot of it to fund share buybacks and dividends which you could use a little bit of financial engineering so I think if you are going to see you squeeze on actually think he might be that this time around\nSo the United states remains the weak point potentially in terms of the global economy\nI think at the moment it's the strongest point I mean we just had some numbers on which in the U.S economy is going to do the full ... percent year along the lines basis but I think you could argue that he's the weakest link because everybody so convinced he's going to stay that way and I think when you look at\nThat being so much higher than it was inflation is just starting to creep up a little bit from strictly investment points of view you've always got to be ... you must know that when people are out there most confident\nIt does seem counterintuitive though in a way of saying that look the economy that's doing best in the world of the world's develop rich economy is uh is the one that's the most vulnerable point\nI think he's ... he's ... he's the world's biggest economies the world's biggest stock market is the world's biggest marketing told them to the world's reserve currency\nI don't know if the U.S Federal Reserve does continue to raise interest rates I Would ... I I Know it's it's not the consensus view I think that would would give a potentially a boost to the U.S dollar and these things as they do go wrong and the rest of the world people both floating the dollar says so that the the Dole are going up will be will be a key feature\nThat in itself will make us exports less competitive and he will drain the queasy from the rest of the world so I'm not too worried about the U.S economy but looking at it through the U.S through financial markets when he means stocks when he means the currency adult goes up that's generally sign that people are worried and it can't be negatives on financial markets overall\nRust mold well we'll look in more detail at some of the specific economic focused in just a minute but first this is talk of invited to the cubs

who are very distressed about quickly rising rents about rising transportation costs personal pain caused by a higher cost of living\nIn one more that I quite like I always say fashion and arts are wonderful place to pay attention to signals because they're so good at capturing like ice\nThe most popular trend in fashion right now is for trans parents translucent fabrics\nLace literally see through fabrics this is the rage and I really didn't think this reflects a societal demand for more transparency people are literally wearing clothes that reveal more in that effort that's a signal to me\nThat was a great Desmond Morris claim wasn't there the the the the psychologist or the the twentieth century talking about about how the rising hemline luring hemline through the decades would indicate the states as\nWell and look at the headlines now what's popular or the jag it any even had minds I think that that is of subjects the other day was wearing one of these on even headlines and I'm like if that isn't hedging your bets I don't know what that is I Want it both ways I think we're going to have a good economy and I'm not sure we're never going to come to me at all so we're we're both links\nTo what I mean we're in a well I mean we have been I think in the last decade ever since two thousand and eight of everybody's sporting bubbles and crushes almost around every corner and I
