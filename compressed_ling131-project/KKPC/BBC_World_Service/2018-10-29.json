been\nResidents dislikes world held its the beating heart to Pittsburgh the neighborhood is a pretty ethnically diverse some the streets and then you've got to a Chinese take away a sushi killing to

saying he now she could be a song\nBeing Jewish you are a minority with what happened in is one block away scary\nAmerica's Jews have reason to be concerned it shakes you at the core and shakes her at the core\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league anti Semitic tax increase by fifty seven percent this year Jeremy ... is a spokesman\nI Want to feel safe I I'm safe I don't know if anyone will ever really feel safe again\nDo you think this is a pulse of the symptom of the political rhetoric we're hearing now think\nThere are many deep chasm that that exist because of the political rhetoric in our country right now\nI'm it's unclear obviously what you know this particular persons motives were outside of the fact that he just wanted to kill Jews obviously the political rhetoric in this country from the alt right is not helpful towards what America should be\nAt Sunday night vigil the community was showing strength the soldiers are\nGetting I hadn't thought it was even a team of therapy dogs from neighboring of high and\nDon't get to sleep that they brought all these dogs here because like right now a bunch of people are very sad and dogs are like really cute and that could actually help people get to see a little over there\n\nSuch gestures may seem smooth in the wake of the new miss tragedy but at a time when the nation's political and cultural divisions appear in ... they all reminder that when tested Americans can come together [noise]\nAnd can get better is that in the strain direct you made the video for Katy Perry's should they be single I kissed a girl she slept with a number of successful young female artist since including non del Rey Aurora and do an iPad and Kenny welcome thank you very much\nKenny how much power do you really hold as a woman in this business\nYou gotta understand I've been a direct a music video director for about eleven years for a lot of humility [laughter] I think I Do hold a lot of power but then the reason for that I think it's because all of\nMy president the work that I have done and I've had enough time to prove myself so people interrupting me or judge me based on the one that I've actually put it\nCan you have a similar body of work and impressive body of work when you say directing a music video you allow to cool to show the adults and do your thing understood\n... I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with them and how collaborative the oddest wants to date I always approach every project openly and seeing that each time it said hold different variants because I'm always kind of different people\nKick the can get very some autistic on his but you've worked with a lot of female on this is not my choice will buy children's yes\nIn some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but the results or the fact that you can often be potentially I Would say ... pigeonholed based on your previous work so safe you out a lot of success with women so the oddest it's very likely you'll get a lot of those trucks which has been my experience for\nYou tend to work with them at the beginning of their careers when they still trying to stop dish ... who they are going to be in some ways yeah yeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent to me a lot of give me when I look at the spread of office you've worked with they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and Kenny\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for a meet people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to fuse women in the videos from a place of strength\nOr a public place so strong story telling\nWell I Want to get into that little bit more because one of the most effective ways of promoting music eighth via sex ... video naked album conflict gruesome ways to sending product\nBut give me ... posts nitty drew the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an office and you know the exploitation\nOh look it depends on what I'm inspired by\n... with the idea of the body\nAnd that of course what it's from a different place from it takes will play is from a place to ensure quality ... there's a southern section is a woman hold when she is powerful in her own sensuality I Do explored but is it tastes well yeah I think a lot of the\nQuote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if that's what inspired by that is why my mom you might be gratuitous don't places I've never good when I Am\nPutting a concept together this new things I'm looking at does this from what the art is what are you trying to say I never think in a way where I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini\nAnd just ... someone throws dollar that horrible if I'm going to do that to me for appeal at the end of that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nBecause I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician with kid on the song is called tease me and said to the gentleman's club\nYou went to a gentleman and the woman\nDancing but I think in the hands of a different direct to that video 'cause I didn't really see any absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nI think that it actually boost raunchy videos ever done when he came out it was it was a big deal because prior to that was it was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but old Justin Bieber clean caught in that video was one of the things that broke him into that ... kind of thinking\nAnd I knew he had a little bit nervous about it you know turning Twenty one I seen at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it's just these women ... says but it is not like you said everyone in the hands of maybe somebody else\nIt will not having these lived on if you saw on the costumes that they were wearing ... they had the ... on doing something very central about the ...\nThey have the power and he was the one actually I was overwhelmed\nThe one than anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is that he probably wants to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now after that you know if\nThere was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of those\nFamous video is is that if the American sing a Katy Perry you know the song is called I kissed to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and\nI was looking to move some production zero is on the video for ... and by then we can sing or how would you say your work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is also for two very very different artists inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with or not is no doubt you're putting your on Pakistan on a project is just no way to not do that because\nEverything you do with what can the intuition and you're making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of kindergartners flavor to project however I always really tried to not\nLet that person will stop or to take an artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more [laughter] thing is that you\nDidn't want to put your personal ... ... that's what I noticed there were just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that is a\nKing is a product you know and and and it's it's funny because I was a real fashion about five years ago where all these ... started putting their names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was\nNot really the best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about and that this is an estimate for the artist if anything to\nKing would you say that the common theme is about how women one to come across these videos about you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival ...\nTo them what is it about you know ... or so you walk away and you listen to the ... Steve how are you in ... because sometimes they really are ... I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny unless it's to me through how either from page to final productive what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me the wrong I go back I can listen to a song and meeting at these matches of pictures in my head like I just see like the frame and then I just have to read those things together\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know police on when I'm brushing my team of adequate when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she would\nCome to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm sleeping with a pen I Do get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them and a hundred percent of the hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] really a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that that's what it is very choosy of picky about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point in the liberal chalk that has come in and in my career boost of\n... of course you get the point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'll be quick deposit I'm a business person\nSecond to last finally quit to put them but we're not pitching lawn cutting that idea very passionate about it I can I can teach that I can feel it I Do everything from the when you look at\nThe jet you're going to win the ... the entire vision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know let me let me I'm kinda I'm\nKenny talks about repeat to listening to all the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth and she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't ... you know you want me so I guess yeah you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\n\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem it sometimes you get a truck and I like to get us a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nAnd if somebody did said if somebody did request [laughter] I'd like to skin female lead is that something that you would ... would you have any say on that oh I definitely would\nOkay on that because what you're trying to portray or\nWhat you're trying to tell me is that unlike the impact and is low beautiful than the doctor just because of the cause of getting it I'm going to have a problem with that I'd never been put in that position than goodness thank God so it's very easy to have you on them I can go this is what I Would do\nBut then if someone was going to act that way I Would probably know from all the competition I had that that person I knew that kind of person I Want to work with\nThat never ends up being put in that position\nCan get you see more women coming to the fore\nAbsolutely that's a lot more female directors now and that's just amazing thing when I started out I was maybe the only ... director ... which is a very big global company\nI was definitely the only one in your ... maybe that was like one other one in the U.S but there was really out of maybe a hundred and fifty years you know he was in Paris [noise]\nI Am now but I at the time when I first started I was based in London so yeah like I said I was one fifty directors who was female and now I'm not saying that it is twenty five twenty five\nThat's definitely a lot more room for improvement but luckily women I now I think there's a reason why women shouldn't be directors and there's a lot of young girls popping up\nWhat do you think has changed can get what is it allows for them to come out now\nIt's hard to be specific and to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to\nAccess editing and and also I think maybe a relatively new thing as of the last two years it's been a initiative started by a female actually quit on her I'll quote free to ... which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos\nIt's a database that exist on line [noise] basically just needs to be female to be a part of it in case somebody looking for a female director that can just sort of go on the website and have a look and say he's out that that basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies to actually pledge to have females in every single pitching process of a commercial\nFor getting that do business know Kenny how hopeful oh you that soon you won't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music video director it's already happening\nWhen I first came into the industry I mean you had fuel directors but the wind you needed to video if you think it's a problem globally there was an African especially in Nigeria\nPicking up or something I said earlier on when she goes as a trend of putting the name on the the music videos actually do that and one of the reasons I Do that is\nBecause it's imperative for me at the little gold watching the television to see that and he looks like a female name that's go that did that video\nHow things have changed is by these young girls do people like king us seeing people like me\nBut I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry not just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men\nWhen I had interviewed I very very conscious of the words that I use a lot of times when you when when you have enemies in my gym at what they tend to say is oh what does it feel like being in in ... industry plus correction is it's not a mule industry the male dominated industries they're trying to change that\nI wrote that tell you how I had been able to come into the industry think about how to drugs remain\nI Need to use positive what if I go oh was me it's so hot and da da da da da\nAnd then it might get into the handle the little girl watching and she's going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep back and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to stay with me\nAnd see that I Am actually competing in this industry that's number one number two men to ship something that big for me is every once in a while and then she would go on Instagram go anywhere and just\nPull out women and go come over here you can email this project and then dumped jumping around understanding that it can be ... senior woman in the position of power and building them as well and so many of them have gone on to be their own directed doing their own little projects I\nSaid last question is your dream artists which on this but you'd like to work with\nKenny I Would say beyond me because she will challenge\n[laughter] sorry we can go there and I have actually against each other for that one [laughter]\nAnd my hair and the other time you'll pay [laughter]\nBeyond said

southern Southern California\n[noise] later on Monday at the u._k. finance minister will deliver his budget it comes after the British prime minister Theresa May promise to an end to austerity after eight years of Eunice is here from our business desk and begin are we expecting a big spending budget for bringing them\nWell as you say shine that Theresa May the conservative party conference last month declared too much than fat that austerity is that after eight years of cuts in public spending and there were phrases in public sector wages and sleeping ... the census particularly at a local government level\nBut the prime minister said that thanks to old ... belt tightening that will be better days ahead this afternoon in parliament all eyes will be on finance minister Philip Hammond he's known as the chance to see if he can deliver on that promise\nKind of MSN from the aims to cheat to fiscal studies here in London says it white ...\nThe ... coming very difficult task ... wants him to induce diversity um but he also has a commitment to trying to eliminate the budget deficit I'm so used to have normal government boring from about the mid twenties ...\nAnd the situation is in in the last financial yeah common boring was around forty billion pounds\nAnd so it was full cost to come down over the next few years but because of cuts to spending so on the one hand he want to not be causing spending because we want vandals territory but on the other hand he needs the deficit to come down until then she be eliminated to me seems to have a commitment to get it fully going\n... juggling act to finance minister Philip Hammond among the spending announcements we are expecting a more money the public services particularly mental health status as well as some money for infrastructure spending and that's in an attempt to base to Britain's productivity\nI mean it's an optimistic headline but aren't Britain's finance is really dependent on Brexit and the deal it gets when it needs to be you\nYes I miss the Hammond is expected to tell and pays today that the really big decisions on public spending can only be made one suspects that deal has been done in Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as kind of innocence as we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe government's focus so far been predicated on a kind of old Elise move Brexit\nIt's under the case if we have a very disruptive breaks it say for example there's no deal made with the European Union and we just read the to trade on WTO terms that would be hugely damaging in the short run\nAnd then we can any effect grocery significantly Mike ... sauce and effect touch revenues to the challenge from the coldest uncertainty ahead of this too\nNow what are the section rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations when these kinds of tragedies in disasters strike\nIn Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found a debris from the aircraft as well as things that they are possessions that they believe belonged to those on board ah they've described things like ... safety jackets um other sorts of possessions but at this point\nThey still haven't found any survivors and obviously the focus is very much on trying to find anybody who may have survived\nA the plane crashed they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas are in the nearby areas to look for any people ah but at this point all that they can tell us is that the such an rescue operation is continuing and they're sending more vessels and helicopters to the area\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to uh to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading any anything into this as a as to the cause of the crash well China what\nThey do say is that they can confound the cause of the ... crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they\nAre looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some thirty to forty meet us into the sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that heath analyzed at so no official confirmation of this analysis I have to add them and what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the washer uh it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance ah in the from from the point that it took off now\nAt those reports that you were talking about the fact that the\nUh aircraft pilot and I should say at had asked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will receive really reveal more information about why this happened\nAnd encouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and there are safety records well\nLion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take a shining to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it ten has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia\nA few years ago covering the crash of a lion air flight a which landed which crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact as the there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nAh the safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty uh to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that lion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested\nIn safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find any further survivors any survivors rather and to find out what happened and why this plane crashed\nCourage not many thanks uh our correspondents in Jakarta encouraged ... the funny there with the latest on that crash of the line a line air airplane

World Service James called moonshine money with you this morning our mind or of our top headline the far right politician dad wants that NATO has promised to change the destiny of Brazil after his ... victory in the presidential election\nAt an Indonesian airliner with more than a hundred and eighty at people on board has crashed into the sea and the future of Germany's governing coalition has been thrown into dumped after both parties suffered another poor results in a regional elections\nThat the news headlines always get the sports headlines or Mexican\nUh moaning folks extensive tributes thing ... to the late chairman of the pop 'em before other people who died in a helicopter crashed\nOn Saturday evening at ... stadium which I'm sure you're watching it on a proposed\nA was a hugely popular figure within the football cup and within the city and county around it because not only did he saved the club financially and then helping them to watch that amazing\nUh English Premier League triumphant twenty six team but to heal says we've been hearing on the program this morning was a extremely generous to to local charities\nAnd local fans on a regular basis without making any ... I'm about to say that in the impact too on the top and the area where it's a whole\nIs going to be very large and do W more a reaction to that too I'm sure on sports today here on the BBC which is the uh late to turn of Nineteen thirty GMT now because we have changed our talks here in the u._k. so we ... a bit to Nineteen so to GMT they will bring you up to date on the latest news\nFrom the Santiago ... stadium where we are expecting at some stage you download Patel you good to be ... as coach a with a turn you come to the favorite to come in much coding to the Spanish ... a market today\nI taught in Manchester City is the game in English Premier League later on today ... will go level with live a ... at the table\nIf they win that game and uh one of the line up in many to bring you this morning but I'm not the time so far scathing review into Australian cricket just condemned winning without counting the costs culture which left players in a gilded bubble that's an independent report which was commissioned by cricket Australia or off the bat full time print scandal\nUh back in South Africa\nEarlier this year [noise] Matthew thank you over aggressive competitive Australians you know you ... and a dad\nHolly Finn [laughter] as Mr has joined us that's not to do this right into both but later on Monday the finance minister will deliver his budget comes out to the British prime minister Theresa May promised an end to stare at the office eight years of it what are we expecting today\nWell as you said James Prime Minister Theresa may declare it at the conservative party conference last month that austerity is only about ... and ... days are ahead\nThat should in theory at least made an end to the belt tightening we've seen in the cuts to services that the British Government has been imposing and to get public finances in order since the financial crisis struck a decade ago it's\nJust how the finance minister Philip Hammond can do that though is another question I'm joined now by the economic ... Michael ... thanks for joining nice day Michael and\nThe government is promising is into austerity but Philip Hammond is in a rather awkward position isn't he because he has to weigh up that promise with another problem is to bring national debt under control that kind of conflicting priorities on they\nWell they could be but he's had a a bit of good fortune ... the body that provides the underlying food costs against which he says the budget have improved lose for costs and hence those new projections reduces budget by ... billion bones you for the next few years\nWhich in addition to the ... Fifteen billion will do such himself gives them plenty of money too\nThat ... well she gained a lot of strength and support particularly with the president market when he chose total kid just to be his ministry of finance oh look at it as an economist that is very respected in Brazil and he's someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs or a warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that was always a parliamentary system disguised as presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament so the key aspects to observe in the relationship between the executive between both ... and ... they shouldn't be\nThe case that this relationship gives we gave us a da da Da Nang six months for when you go because\nUh if his relationship starts to tremble all little bits and show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nCapitol yeah I'd I'd go at their Brazil analysts on that big win at four giant most ... the country's new president but also big challenges had [noise]\n\nHis won't support you're on the streets of Sao paolo area\nHow about fame last country going to move forward because of my cat and my president you know to um a phobic kid the men of gold he's a man of character he has no corrupt he will fight for oil Brazilians if I don't know that\nThat's what's most surprising is that supports both scenarios gained from the business community and on the financial markets surprise me because he freely admits he doesn't really know much about the economy so I Want to know more about how the parent Margaret could gain the support for businesses\nSo I spoke to the BBC South America business correspondent Daniel got us\nIs definitely the the candidate of the business community at this stage um both should NATO every time she had good polling numbers in this election football stuck a shingles story and going up and we had a pretty good run a this month with the stock exchange basically investors pricing in that she will win\nIn the past the business community used to be tied to um center right candidate but they performed really badly in this election this is an election for an\nAn outsider to politics even though I Will sort of has been in Congress for a long time he's always been a back venture and he presents himself as an outsider to the mainstream\nAll you have to understand about president economics and markets is generally what they're really concerned is about stopping left wing parties specially the workers bodies hard for someone who's not in ... which is sort of understand just how much\nA most businesses big businesses and make financial plays and they hate the workers parties and their policies of intervention in state so basically they win brace at any one who stands against that\nEven somebody who's such an outside of it because you know markets and lots of businesses really like stability and predictability so as an outsider who's been such a fringe parts of a Brazilian politics in the past he was still seen as a practical alternative to um his left wing opponents\nThe thing is that the sort of center right politicians couldn't get enough votes so the business community you have to make a choice of you know who has the best chance of winning and tribal sonata was definitely the person [noise]\nSo what she did you get the business community on board he named a powerful figure for his economic team that's Paolo gadgets\nThe bank a man from the business community himself a liberal economist and someone who's from Mr carry on with very pro business reforms\nPuzzle gauges became a very powerful figure in this campaign he's almost seen as a sort of a prime minister to hide well for not being a president in the sense that you get all the power that he needs\nTo get the economic reforms approved in Congress and move forward with this very liberal agenda of privatizing state to companies and know promoting budget cuts and that's something the business community was really happy about\nThat's a good job but he's got someone who's a an experienced economists there isn't it because in a in an interview earlier this month with a global a newspaper in Brazil he said in truth I Know nothing about the economy\nExactly had once when I used to actually sort of bragged that she doesn't understand too much about the economy and\nThat's almost seen as a strength of the fact that he's delegating all his powers to ...\nBut a lot of people in the markets are also concerned you know what happens if they have a fight you know if they break up from from the spin this has been described a lot as a sort of a marriage of two people so what happens if they break up\nOr what happens if other people inside it both in his cabinet or get it you know stand against ... no one can really predict what will happen because ... pretty unpredictable a lot like Donald Trump which is sort of person that he's been a nearing himself into doing this campaign\nSo it's a record sun and the uh the business community or or people in Brazil in general are voted in a ... and our because they think they'll get ... to run the economy but they might end up with ... votes in Arab but ... says\nYes that is one concern and that's one thing that Chad Wilson I has been stressing all along that he will not divorced from ... and that that they will remain married until the end of the term\nBut also now is he was about a lot of things are very different from what all the gadget stands for ... in the past ... pretty much a supported interventionist policies\nOr he was always in favor of you know state controlled company Petra breath and now she is sort of changing his speech at nice to sit this idea of you know minimal state and in ... at privatized companies\nSo ... it's hard to tell what happens next ... years old views stand or will his new self and the person of balls of gadgets actually be the one that that goes forward\nBoth ... a very divisive figure some people even say quite dangerous to democracy you know he's seen as much for retiree and figure he said some things are quite offensive to a lot of people have arts um homosexuals and women and his approach to fighting crime is not something that the business community is so desperate to sea\nChange in the way the country's run from an economic point of view that for pets are overlook\nWell they say that both so now is just as bad as the workers' party when we're talking about democracy or even a a not as bad as the workers' party\nUm there's a deep hatred within the business community especially the financial markets against the workers' party which they say support regimes like Nicholas ... doodle him in as well so they really turned a blind eye to all the things that will sonata says\nAbout you know are tackling Congress the Supreme Court and all the risks that he brings to democracy they changed the game a bit around and they say well look the other guys are just as bad as both so not\nThe BBC's Daniel guy last in Sao paolo\nBrazil the president doesn't know much about the economy don't worry his right hand man the Paolo gods as does at least that seems to be the hope for businesses and the financial markets\nHe's an avid proponents of free markets and privatized patients get the government that's running the economy and let the markets work it out but will the approach fix Brazil's economic problems Brazil recently emerged from the worst recession in its history\nAnd it faces rising government debt Gabrielle ... is a Brazilian economist and associate professor in development economics at Oxford University here in the u._k. we have a very\nDelicate and difficult situation I had the first perhaps and foremost is the fiscal situation which is very worrisome I Would have a extremely large deficits and the growing public that we need to urgently shape public spending for the TV tough labor has stagnated so the challenges are had a considerable\nWhat do you think is the thing that the people who voted for both in our what you think that they will wants him to the first in terms of the economy in terms of business\nTo me honestly it's unclear what the demand is in terms of economic policies I think they're voting for him for a kind of like a sense of security and to tackle directly corruption\nI don't think people understand what the stakes are and what the necessary measures are to attack or economic challenges I think they believe that actually he will be able to cut taxes which has been a into that but I don't think that's possible at all given that we have to tackle our current ...\nI think they also expect major privatization and reducing the scope for example for corruption in state on into enterprises\nBut now it's also unclear whether or not he will actually implemented\nIn Palo graduates at least we're talking about a man who is a very free market economist believes in the free markets in private\nThey should and that's not something that Brazil is hired a huge amount of experience with at least with most recent governments more socialist policies have been in place is is it can be a problem to implement those kind of policies in Brazil\nAbsolutely absolutely I think there is a scenario where he embraces ... agenda and try to implement a just a extreme liberalism economic liberalism in Brazil I think he will face a fierce opposition\nFrom unions social movements that will be led by the tea which is actually pretty good at playing the opposition pro so I think we can be looking at and liberal similar to Argentina for example where like you have strikes every other day and a very serious political impasse\nThe financial markets has been welcoming both ... robberies in the polls are the last few weeks and will no doubt welcome his election they wrong to be so ...\nI think so I think there's a lot of wishful thinking their economic liberalism can only work its magic if it's implemented on a level playing field and we're talking about a country that's marked by extreme inequalities opportunities for example stream inequalities across a gender race and social backgrounds so\nWhen you have a country that Sony across Brazil is which deep in the College of opportunities\nLiberalism will not produce substantial growth as promised\nYou are listening to business daily from the b._b._c. World Service Brazilian economists Gabrielle elicit they was talking about whether the free market reforms could work in Brazil there is a cool a precedent for this in Latin America and warm but Paolo judges will be familiar with\nOkay bear with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies and other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free markets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman\nOf good news last over to the gym I Do a lot of heat for every cloud as a silver lining as I say that if the schools because it was working in the archives opened my eyes and allowed me to save the true one\nOf the things we're talking to her in the finals was it more illegals all Soviet agents were being used against the Soviet union's own dissidents and they were ever used against the west to Prague Spring of Nineteen sixty eight was from a truck in a particular turning point\nBecause we're talking like many others have been looking forward to the evolution of the Soviet regime into something like democratic socialism and democratic socialism pills to be turning up in ... in London sixty eight within a few months the Russians have some of the forces from the wall so packed\nSuppress it but more illegals were involved in penetrating the leadership of the products for\nThan in any operation they have ever done in any country in the west\nAnd the code language who for some of that in little trucking or cook\nFor years after the Prague Spring especially in the truck and was appointed chief architect and put in charge of moving the KGB entire foreign intelligence\nThe guys from the Libyan ... to ... building on the outskirts of most good\nSo what do you have to do a ... year after year after year was to trick every file a ... and chicken back in the other end\nThat initially he thought it was going to be difficult to make notes transcripts or so and so you did it in little bits of pipe would she would screw up and then put it in his shoes but he gradually realized look because he was in charge nobody's going to search on the way up\nSo he just ... pages in his inside poking went back to his mosque a flat and then put one look back\nAt the weekend he take them to the family ... country house outside most ... touch all the time but [noise] and I [noise] I\nWas one of those ...

all you have you have really finite result is a nice\nBreak quickly trying to translate to that global economy when I finished my second round the world and realize that in effect was no different and

didn't esoteric I was struck a more positive note he told supporters of victory fool the greens have been achieved\n... uh as this I'm Will know that I talked to people this is a fantastic thing for us the Green Party\nHas has never been to the green and we can be proud of the fact that we went from being in government into an election in which we don't even want to say much trust through what
