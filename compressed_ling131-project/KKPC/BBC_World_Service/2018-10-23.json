dismissed as having an anxiety reaction or overreacting\nWhere it being a stress response\nIt's easy to compare men and women when it comes to heart attack but if he says the women often suffer from

that may have to do with anxiety or depression or even things like digestive system is what we now call irritable bowel syndrome migraine headaches many of these have been chalked\nUp to being just related to stress meaning there's nothing really wrong or going on\nOr actually talked about is if they were all in women's heads why is that this problem\nThere are a lot of complexities and how this insidious biases actually crept into medicine one is that there has been historically\nA great lack of research into medical symptoms and conditions that largely impact women so auto immune diseases things like how she mode owes lupus MS and many many others\nWithout the research is ... ... women we\nKnow for example that it takes a woman on average who has an auto immune condition five years and five different doctors to get an accurate diagnosis\nA so there's a dearth of research women have largely also been even excluded from a pharmaceutical research so even knowing how medications work we often don't know how these are working in women\nAlso of even argues that there are a few financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to do expensive research into food that people can simply pick up from the local green grocer\nAnd when I did that picture changed completely the United states gets roughly a hundred and eight dollars per person which places them seventeenth on the list of the twenty nine countries have accurate data for the Scandinavian countries to take the well known way leads the way with seven hundred and eighty dollars to person\nAnd Sweden Denmark upset and full on the list contributing roughly five hundred and fifty dollars and four hundred dollars respectively\nWhile the ... and I've even countries contributing so much\nWell let me take you back to Nineteen Seventy\nWhen the United nations tickets suggestion from a commission that looked to the future development assistance it proposed to countries get no point seven percent of gross national income to

gross national income\nNow if the United states wanted to get no point in some sense it would need to find an additional hunts\nTape billion dollars on ... five billion dollars it already getting\n... so that's the dates that when we look at twenty nine countries that report eight spending to the er we CD but once about the ones that don't some more secretive than others one in particular has brought pox again\nChina is a particularly opaque donor and lender it has opted out of international recording systems such as the CDs creditor reporting system and the international aid transparency initiative in fact Beijing considers the details of its overseas development program to be a state secret\nDot didn't put bride and his team also\nWe've developed an open source method of data collection that provides very detailed financial operational on location all information about Chinese government financed\nProjects all around the globe coming from four different places from English Chinese and local language news reports from documents that Chinese ministries embassies\nAnd economic and commercial ... offices put it in the public domain from the aid in debt information management systems of China's counterpart countries so think of the finance and planning ministries that are on the receiving end\nThese incoming money and then finally there's a large body of studying field research where people are studying individual Chinese government sponsored activities so we developed this very index methodology to synthesize all this information into a database of about forty four hundred\nChinese government financed projects and a hundred and thirty eight countries around the world\nSo walk to the numbers show in terms of what China is spending it tastes off the old the world's second largest economy\nOne of the major findings that emerges is that the vast majority of the funding from the Chinese government does not qualify as foreign aid and the strict sense of the term Seventy seven percent of the funding does not qualify as oh da and over a Fifteen year period for which we have reliable data two thousand two thousand fourteen\nChina spent roughly five and a half billion dollars a year on the o da and by comparison the U.S provided at least twenty five billion dollars of OJ each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a foreign aid the U. S. outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the o da is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly fifty percent bigger than China's so for the U.S to be outspending China on OD a by five hundred percent suggests a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows China and the U.S look a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two thousand fourteen\nThe U.S government spent roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time\nSo if you brought in the aperture and use that broader definition of aid China's spends about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year and the U.S spends about twenty six billion dollars a year\nTrying to get lots of aid money to Africa and spends particularly heavily on infrastructure projects across energy transport and communications because most of these projects a commercial that don't count tools or da\n... China's apricot pits a number it's around for almost ... da Seventeen dollars for post ... when all of the money is fucked and remember that the equivalent us number is a hundred and eight dollars per person brought pops pointed out to me that bull so China is a global economic superpower\nStill has a huge number of people living in poverty\nSo politically giving overseas aid is difficult on mice explain why the Chinese government is so uptight about what you do [noise] so for this week but if you have any questions do email more or less a BBC the CEO of UK bought sweet\nBBC more or less [noise]\n\nMm this is Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety four one FM case for Denver fourteen Ninety am Casey of sea Boulder on H.

need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the and and the multi drug resistant\nAnd extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem all over the world where there are an estimated almost five hundred and fifty eight thousand people with empty or TB and only twenty nine percent are treated so when we use this new drug but ...\nAnd this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seems to have been the key to which was a major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting\nOr tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago\nAnd the point was that we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ... and we need new tools\nThat we knew tool like a new medication right but ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis in the world\nAnd if it has and of course of availability I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess and extremely important in the fact that ever done in a country like the ... is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine or so called program condition I think it really shows the um the fact\nThat they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis and this way and this is an ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big breakthrough bit remind us why TB is so deadly and why have some forms of the illness become drug resistant and\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy\nSo what happens when programs don't work will you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis empty arch Eby the ex DR TB and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat until they came up with uh the regiments containing ... for example tobacco and treatment was\nUp to ... uh two years and now when we had the short course regiment which doesn't even have to use what we called an injectable drugs we have to you you get these painful injection or for many many days of the treatment\nIt means that we can cut the treatment down too short and a nine month and we're working now and the TV community to get the regimen down to just six months for sales\nSo this new at suggest again for our listeners this new drug ... and it is kind of really cure um T. being all instances\nBut Jacqueline in one of the as I say I'm into one of the two new drugs that we have\nWhenever we have a new drug or with time if it's not used properly what can happen is that a resistance can develop to that drug so it's very important that we keep doing the research that it needed to develop a new medications that we can give a that we can get people\nAnd is it available now\nIt is available the uh the company a Johnson Johnson which has developed this medication\nHas a is currently where there are some trials going on around the world\nBut they have made it

D R T being which is even worse\nAnd what was what happened here was that the treatments success was Ninety three percent and that is excellent by any any comparison to even usual tuberculosis and even though there were at will be called adverse events there were some lab abnormalities almost all were manageable and treatment didn't have to be stopped\nWith this study does is to speak to the importance\nOf the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the ... in a multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem all over the world where there are an estimated almost five hundred and\nFifty eight thousand people with empty or TV and only twenty nine percent are treated so when we use this new drug but ... and this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seems to have been the key\nSo what's your major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago\nAnd the point was that we have to treat all people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ... and we need new tools\nThat new tools like a new medication like the ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis from the world\nAnd for that and then of course of ... I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess and extremely important in the fact that ever done in a country like the liver is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world are fact that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine or so called program conditions I think is really shows the um\nThe fact that they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis and this way and this is an ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big break through a bit remind us why TB is so deadly and why have some forms of the illness become drug resistant and\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis is something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy\nSo what happens when programs don't work will you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis empty arch UB his ex DR TB and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat\nUntil they came up with a regimen containing ... for example ... treatment was up to ... uh two years and now when we had the short course regiment which doesn't even have to use what we called an injectable drugs we have to you you get these painful injection or for many many days of the treatment\nIt means that we can cut the treatment down too short to nine months\nAnd we're working now and the TV to me to get the regimen down to just six months\nFor sale for our listeners this new drug but Jacqueline Kennedy really cure TB all instances\nBut Jacqueline is one of the as I say only the one of the two new drugs that we have\nWhenever we have a new drug with time if it's not used properly what can happen is that a resistance can develop to that drug so it's very important that we keep doing the research that it needed to develop new medications that we can give that we can get people\nDr Paulos what you are there at the scientific director of the international union against tuberculosis split firewood they showed a lot of\nNo surprise to miss it and so this morning after his impressive display for us no last night the school didn't set up two goals for ... and make a ... they'd be less to three one and now two points of the top of the table and it's ten consecutive

kilometers long and links or Hong Kong Macau to the Chinese mainland Philip is on our business is a it's going to make travel or Asia mentioned\nIt is it's going to ... troubled times between uh the different regions from four hours to ram Fifteen minutes the bridge which is designed to withstand earthquakes and talked looms\nWas built with four hundred thousand tons of steel enough to build around sixty Eiffel Tower was about sixty kilometers of its total linked crosses over the seat of the ... river delta\nThen somewhat confusing for a bridge it goes under the water for around six point seven kilometers middle section dips into an undersea tunnels or the ships can go over the top\nThrough two artificial islands but ... is one of the world's most densely populated regions currently Hondurans sixty eight million people on the fifty five to them and as long as ... percent longer than the troubled Tom ... very impressive but it needed\nThe problem here is the definition of the wood needed he said try and discuss the issue in very very carefully the bridge was conceived in the Nineteen eighties ... so some serious problems that China had then as it was looking to open up its calling me I'm looking to integrate Hong Kong\nWhile allowing Hong Kong to the industrialized on to explore the factories that it was losing across the mainland\nThe emotional problem is because it's now twenty Eighteen and most of those issues on really issues anymore is professor meet ... ... from the Chinese University of Hong Kong who's been telling us exactly why the opening of the bridge is not going to reach it by everybody\nThe idea of the project has been around for a long time when it was such a race or that was that in the Nineteen eighties when China and just started opening a door\nAnd the whole idea you know I and the discussion was to move economic activities on the eastern side of the Paris I doubt that to the western side you know that was the time when how college steal\nThe central rising as industries that all these developments has been taken over by events the whole economy like they ... and the Paris I doubt that has changed and transformed and saw the original intention of building the Brits for\nThat the centralized fashion of industrial activities at that is not here anymore\nRight now Wal Mart clippers are actually playing James you want me to preach have a name to which multiplies which bridge or actually three cable stay rich making a bridge is making themselves plus the undersea tunnel then you've got the two artificial islands as well so the catchy title there so far using his Hong Kong's you hardly Macau bridge\nAnd ... isn't a strain director who made the video for Katy Perry's should they be single I kissed a girl she slept with a number of successful young female ought to since including non del Rey Aurora and do anything\nGetting done Kenny welcome thank you very much felt Kenny how much power do you really hold as a woman in this business\nYou gotta understand I've been to direct a music video director for about eleven years submit a lot of humility [laughter] I think I Do hold a lot of power but then the reason for that I think it's because all of a\nBy president the work that I have done and I've had enough time to prove myself so people interact with me or judge me based on the one that I'm actually put it\nCan you have a similar body of work and impressive body of work when you were that direct singing music video you allowed to cool the show the adults and do your thing understood\n... I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with and how collaborative the oddest wants to date I always approach every project or ... and a theme that each time it said a whole different experience because I'm always I kind of different people\nThat can get very similar to the artist but you've worked with a lot of female on this is my choice will by chance\nYes in some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but the results or the fact that you can often be ... I Would say ... ... pigeonholed based on your previous work for say if you had a lot of success with women felt an artist it's very likely you'll get a lot of those trucks which has been my experience for\nYou tend to work with them at the beginning of their careers when they still trying to stop dish ... were they going to be in some ways yeah\nYeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent me a lot\nOkay me when I look at the spread of office you've worked with they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and Kenny\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for a meet people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to infuse women in the videos from a place of strength\nOr publicly so strong story\nTelling well I Want to get into that little bit more because one of the most effective ways of promoting music is it via sex you know when the video and naked album cover some ways to sending product\nBut any way to you personally draw the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an office and you know the exploitation\nLook it depends on what I'm inspired by\nHighlight flooded with the idea of the Seventy body and that of course but it's from a different place from it takes will play is from a place of sensuality each there's a certain section is\nA woman holds weight and she is powerful in ... sensuality I Do explored but is it tasteful yeah I think a lot of the quote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if that is by by that is what if I had my um you might be gratuitous in some places I'm never going to a judge when I Am\nPutting a concept together that few things I'm looking at does this promote the art is what are you trying to say I never think in a way way I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini\nAnd you have someone throwing dollars that are all if I'm going to do that you have to be for appeal at the end of that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nBecause I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician with kid on the song is called tease me and said to the gentleman's club you went to a gentleman\nAnd the woman dancing but I think in the hands of a different director that video because I haven't really seen absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nI think that is actually the most raunchy videos ever done when he came out it was a it was a big deal because prior to that was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but old Justin Bieber clean caught and that video was one of the things that broke him into that fix them will kind of thinking\nAnd I know he's had a little bit nervous about it do turning Twenty one I think at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it's just these women and done this but it's not like you said it every once in the hands of maybe somebody else\nIt will not have been tastefully done if you saw from the costumes that they were wearing they had the ... on doing something very central about the ...\nThey have the power and he was the one actually I was overwhelmed\nThat wasn't anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is and you probably wants to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now after that you know if\nThere was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of those\nFamous videos is that if the American sing a Katy Perry you know the song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production via was on the video cleaned and by then we can sing or how do you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is all through two very very different artists inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with an artist no doubt you're putting your on ... on a project is no way to not do that because\nEverything you do with what human intuition and you'll making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of king about his flavor to\nProject however I always really tried to not let that pass them stop or to take an artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more\nDifferent [laughter] thing that you\nDidn't want to put your personal simple enough that that is one of those that are just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that isn't king is a product\nYou know and and and it's it's funny because I was a real fashion about five years ago where all these ... to start putting names on projects and I always thought was uncomfortable about that which probably was\nNot really the best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about it is not this is a ... but it's meant for the artist if anything suit\nCan get what you say that the common theme is about how women want to come across these video is about and you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an audit asked us thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know also you walk away and you listen to the ... see how you interpret it because sometimes there really are ... I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny I'd like to me through now either from page to final products like what are your techniques\nSo you know they gave me the ball I go back I can listen to a song and immediately I snatch is of pictures in my head like I just like the frame and then I just have to reduce\nThe gather and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know police on when I'm washing my teams that played when I'm cooking when I'm drinking so why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea initially ...\nCome to me in ways and you know when I'm speaking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down to then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them and a hundred percent of the hundred the article I Love that idea [laughter]\nA hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to that's that's what it is I shouldn't have about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point to the level of trust that has come in and in my career based all\nTypes of ... of course you get the point I'm like okay he said this is what we need to do and I thought that this is what we need to do I because I'm equate deposit I'm a business person\nSecond to last ... plus plus it will not pitching while sending an idea very passionate about it I can I can teach it I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look at the jet you're going to win the prop eventually the entire vision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know\nLet me let me I can get 'em\nGimme talks about repeat listening so the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth when she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore I'm\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't ... you know you almost like yeah you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\n\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a truck and I like when you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nAnd if somebody did say if somebody did request [laughter] and light skinned female lead is that something that you would ... would you have any say on that\nOh I definitely have to say on that because\nIf what you're trying to portray all\nWhat you're trying to tell me is that life is in Palestine is more beautiful than the dos and just because of the causes can then I'm going to have a problem with that I've never been put in that position than goodness thank God so it's very easy for me to sit here and be on the Mike and go this is what I Would do\nBut then if someone was going to act that way I Would probably know from on the conversation I had with that person I knew that this is not the kind of person I Want to work with but I've never ends up being put in that position\nCan get are you seeing more women coming\nTo the fore absolutely that's a lot more female directors now and that's just amazing thing when I started out I was maybe the only ... director\n... which is a very big political company but it's definitely the only one in your ... maybe that was like one other one in the U.S but there was really out of maybe a hundred and fifty or interview in Paris\nI Am now but I at the time when I first started I was based in London so yeah like I said I was one fifty directors who was female and now I'm not saying that it is twenty five twenty five\nThat's definitely a lot more room for improvement but luckily women are now realizing there's no reason why women shouldn't be directors and there's a lot of young girls popping up\nWhat do you think it's changed can get what is it allows for them to come out now\nHow to be specific and to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to\nAccess editing and and also I think maybe a relatively new thing out of the last two years it's been a negative started by a female she quit on her out called free to bed which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos\nIt's a database that exist on line basically just need to be female to be a part of it [laughter] so are you in case somebody looking for a female director that can just sort of go on the website and have a look and say he's out there that basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies to actually pledge to have females in every single pitching protests of commercial ... yes\nI Do know Kenny how who full oh you that soon you won't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music video director it's already happening\nWhen I first came into the industry I mean you had fuel directly with the wind you need to video if you think it's a problem globally was\nIn Africa and especially in Nigeria picking up some thinking I said earlier on when she goes and the trend of putting the name on the the music videos actually do that and one of the reasons I Do that is\nBecause it's imperative for me at the little girl watching the television to see that any mass looks like a female name that's the goal that did that video how things have changed is\nBy these young girls and people like king of seeing people like me but I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry\nNot just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men\nWhen I have interviews I'm very very conscious of was that I use a lot of times when you when when you have interviews in my gym at what they tend to say is oh what does it feel like being in in ... industry plus correction it's it's not a mule industries a male dominated industry they're trying to change that\nI wrote that tell you how I had been able to come into the industry things I've talked to John to remain\nI Need to use positive what if I go oh what me it's so hot and da da da da da\nAnd then you might get into the hands of the little girl watches you going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep back and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to sing with me and see that I Am actually competing in this industry that's number one number two men to ship something that big for me is every once in a while and then she will go on Instagram go anywhere just pull out women and go\nCome over here you can be on this project and then dumped just being around understanding that it can be done being a woman in the position of power and building them as well and so many of them have gone on to be their own direct to doing their own little projects like I\nSaid last question is your dream artists which on his was you'd like to work with Kenny\nI Would say beyond me because she will challenge\nWe can\nActually get to try that for that one [laughter]\nYou know even here in the other time you pay [laughter]\nBeyond said is said thank you both came me and ... and it's been a pleasure speaking to you and the conversation today thank you thank you I've been talking to the wood winning music directors can be edited by from

Parkland led to the deaths of Seventeen school children and stuff\nIt was the most high profile multiple shooting in twenty eight team but in fact less deadly than to others last year in Texas and Nevada\nThe rate of these horrifying killings breeze by lunar shooters has seemed to accelerate over recent years is also intensified the political argument in the U.S when an by how much should America tighten its gun laws ... is a reporter with the progress of gun control lobby group based in Washington DC\nGun control is very much a part of this election I think we've seen a number of mass shootings in the United states in the past few years that have made gun control a political issue and I think the timing of the Parkland shooting in Florida this February\nJust before the midterms really made it so that candidates across the country have to respond to this issue of gun legislation and what they would do if they were elected\nHow is it coming across our congressmen themselves being direct lobbied\nAre more interest groups coming in supporting candidate from the left from the gun safety lobby than there has been in past elections I think it's interesting that the national Rifle Association has decreased depressed\nSince in these midterm elections either because of their financial woes this year or because they just understands that the money is really coming in from the other side\nThe national Rifle Association or NRA is as a player in this debate America's oldest civil rights organization at low base for the rights of us citizens to bear arms to keep\nAs it says with the second amendment to the U.S constitution Bob Spitzer is a professor of political science at the state University of New York and he studied extensively the roots of the organization\nThe n._r._a. was formed way back in Eighteen Seventy one by to civil war veterans who during the civil war saw first hand that the typical American young adult male didn't no one end up a gun from the other\nAnd so they formed the n._r._a. to improve the shooting a marksman ship skills of militia eligible men and they did shooting tournaments sporting competitions things like that and it really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties that it began to turn ... attention more to politics\nCongress passed the gun Control Act of Nineteen sixty eight and in the Nineteen seventies there was a measure in Congress to severely restrict access to hand guns\nGun rights people within the n._r._a. felt that they were being attacked in besieged by the rest of the country so that group took control and ever since then they become much more political much more focused even obsessed with what they call gun rights and it's produced the organization that we know today\nCity in our age is kind of rabble rousing group that is ... the rights of Americans to bear arms it is not a gun lobby group and yet it does have a presumably an intimate relationship with a gun making industry\nWell the ... does have a long connection to the gun industry and had behaved as the sort of political mouthpiece because they have one overriding common interest to press as many guns into his many hands as possible\nThat have been a number of school shootings of course in the United states we think of Columbine Sandy Hook and others most recently has been the Stoneman Douglas shooting in Florida which\nDoes seem more than other events to have galvanized a movement against the gun lobby how much of a threat has that been to the the ...\nThe high school students who tend to the Parkland high school in Florida\nThey did something that victims have never done before instead of seeking privacy and avoiding the media\nThey went in front of national cameras and said look we're sick of this our leaders have failed us we're tired of them being afraid of the gun lobby and they have aggressively pushed this issue throughout the spring summer and now into the fall of this election year\nAnd by doing that they're trying to keep the issue as a top tier concern\nSo that after the elections there may be greater momentum to perhaps in ... stronger gun laws [noise]\nAnd it was a terrible tragedy should never\nNothing is going to be done about it and they asked how much money from the [noise]\nLower the shooting them and Douglas students like ... Gonzales here have\nDirected that political file on the n._r._a. fellow advocate ... describes how surprisingly affected the students efforts to galvanize political opinion and an emerging ... campaign around the n._r._a. have been\nThe victims and survivors of these of this shooting were high school students who knew very smartly how to use social media and how to kind of leverage their pain and their fear\nInto politics and very quickly and there are a few dozen companies that were offering discounts to NRA members lot of them are household names you had a rental car companies that I'm sure people\nUse all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all those companies for transparency the public deserves to now which companies are\nSupporting the gun lobby and I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a. in that week after the Parkland shooting very quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly\nPulled their relationships with the n._r._a. which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could chip away at some of that are as power\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of forums for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these movies\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and the ... finances\nWe know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting factor that like I mentioned earlier\nIs if you look at the n._r._a. spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidates that we would've expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. with spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twin the fourteen mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for the ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawal miss a pool for the n._r._a. but we did reach one candidate base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David lab of stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was stalking some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a tension and to us than had some fifty thousand signatures on it but what we've already watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was ... and that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what we're seeing and watch them in front of primary in our social media channels [noise]\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and rainy trying to get a feel for this before making rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long Kenyan vendors ... who's\n... hours then says apps and the holding company [noise]\nSo they were very round people um that I was in the in line to us than would've been impacted by our decisions\nRight so I mean essentially ... the prime movie made right was to to to stop selling on your show products made by this phone vista outdoor ... which\nWas you would not selling firearms or ammunition yourself Mr out during the manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey got it up for sale I don't think it's being sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nBy this case being thrown out and I was absolutely convinced that was not going to happen [noise]\nDid you manage to convince Pinochet himself with that\nI'm not sure I did my Spanish was never good enough\nTo her not show by the way that he ever invoked himself to that extent to detail in any of these cases if I have one criticism often is that

one point we had a huge argument with him about the need to issue an article\nExplaining his own personal situation and his advisors said that that would reduce his dignity\nAnd I said that you know after Fifteen months sitting in a baritone went versus dignity had been substantially reduced\nAs it is and that it might be worth producing an optical explaining his situation but they said ... what

hearing all the rest of it didn't happen it kept on going higher and higher and higher and there was zero success ... from the legal perspective from day one we didn't win a single significant hearing\nIn fact the legal battle was moving against Pinochet in Nineteen Ninety nine the Lord's ruled that Pena shake could be extradited serious crimes allegedly committed often Nineteen eighty eight when Britain had rectify the un convention on torture\nIt was a momentous decision overturning the international tradition of immunity for former heads of state\nBut Patrick had already begun pushing a different idea an exception on the grounds of Pinochet's ill health\nHe was a frail man in question about it he was quite large and to be moved around with care\nI think what the media does

whole set up by natural treaties on nuclear weapons and and\nThere are some accusations from both sides of of ah violations but there are mechanisms within the treaties she saw these things out and ... would be the normal way of doing it this of course this is President Trump case and quite different directions quite often\nI mean you see this possibly on the part of President Trump is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent\nI I Hope it's negotiating tactic and it would be fully to go down the road in the arms race which led us into a you know nearly Seventy thousand weapons
