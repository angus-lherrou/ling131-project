what's wrong with a little promoting gender equality given that women ... under represented at the top of California's companies\nOh clearly underrepresented ... grossly underrepresented and not only grossly underrepresented but we know it's incredibly important to have women on\nNot just publicly traded boards but on private boards we know is incredibly important to have women in politics in the law and we're nowhere near that I just don't like the fact\nThat this is a government mandated quota and I actually think that it's likely or has some serious legal issues and may not withstand constitutional scrutiny\nRight so you think businesses then might if they push for it to be able to get this little are you with us and\nI think absolutely businesses are ready to file in court if not tomorrow the next day and the problem for an\nAmerican court system is of course we have something called equal protection under the law and this law specifically on its face creates a preference for women and I'm not sure that um that California will be able to defend that in the legislative history when\nOur law makers were debating this there was an analysis that said there could be some serious legal challenges here and you can't just point to statistics and say there's gross under representation of women because that's true you need more than that to withstand constitutional scrutiny\nBut if companies themselves on a lot of companies on putting women on boards and the government you'll saying shouldn't be able to to mandate to then some companies would get away with not

popularity\nWell I didn't think that late seventies eighties it was first the Latina artists and then the feminist art is with Hayden however his book clearly two thousand and two summer high ex film further popularized Frida Kahlo but I think that for me what's really interesting is that\nBeyond the sensationalism of her biography her paintings and her art the deeper people look they see that she was clearly of her time influenced by the Mexican revolution by by communism et cetera but she was also ahead of her time\nSo it wasn't just feminist it was also people with disabilities people of color people who were marginalized her work deals with issues that are very relevant today like identity the female body\nA gender cross dressing or issues of what it means to seal fractured inside\nNot be able to be a mother or not want to be a mother she gives visual voice to topics that had never been discussed or represented in the visual arts and she completes the destabilized or the

she paints and I mean trafficking women with not painted in that little stores so so why she emphasizing these characteristics she thing but she doing here\nI think it's as we have in discussing is

or the\nIntersection she represents a Mexican woman as an artist female dark skin Mexican and disable if all these values are so relevant today\nAnd she's always interrogation norms and assumptions isn't she Oregon I'm thinking of her painting a few small knit when she's talking about how women are regarded I Wonder if she could tell us about this painting\nA few small nips shows a murder victim\nSomething she read about in the newspapers and the tabloid press in Mexico of someone who's being stopped multiple times by the\nLover and when questioned by police was reportedly said all I did was give her a few small knit the painting shows a buddy competent stop monks had blood falling out of the frame of the picture as though it's leaking on to the gallery flow [laughter] it was about\nThe way in which human beings can act in incredibly in human waste towards each other and she was I think more horrified by the shoe small nips from uc than by the fact that this person had been stopped\nI'm guinea does a painting of herself around the time of her divorce from the era where she's dressed as a mom but with her head chopped off and she writes the top I loved you\nYour ... you know you don't how many times I Love you read the mole which she tried to send this picture\nWell she comes from Mexico a very macho society uh she comes from a place where women did not have the vote until after free to ... think about it she was very political but she couldn't even vote in Mexico during her lifetime\nA in this specific painting she shows herself removing vestiges of her femininity her braid her\nHair and she's putting on something that looks like an oversized man's suit taking on the power and the authority that males have\nThe lyrics that she writes on top\nWere friends how women's identities and sexuality is tied in with their hair and how there is no unconditional love of women only if they act in a certain way so I think into a few small knit she uncovers the violence against women\nAnd here she tries to free herself of this role of a woman who is subordinate to a man and shows herself as a kind of and dry in this creature\nSo see all this attention to detail and it's very self conscious use of her body and the ... trip to question and such but at the same time she's in some law school she was referred to as the ... the queen isn't she\nReferring to

from very severe depression that went on diagnosed for quite a long time it ended up actually leading to her very early demise\nThat was one of the very early sparks that interested me in a better understanding how we can think about disease and and treat it out of my own experience but then as I developed in this field of women's health and beginning to understand\nThat there were these profound sex differences across organ systems and in psychiatric disease as well and to better understand what happened then and how we actually change the path forward\nOne of my earliest seminars that I took as an undergraduate at Harvard was with a professor at Emory at Harvard and she was the first ten year old woman in the biology department at Harvard\nShe was a renowned feminist and had work to develop a field that focused on looking at biology through a feminist lens\nAnd it really opened my eyes to the historical issues that women face but also\nHow that intersected with biology with science and with care and I came in wanting to be a physician and it just sparked a life long journey for me\n[noise] sticker why women for you\nOf course my mother's friends gynecologist in Somalia so seen are working hard and and saving the woman's and she lost her mother doing the birth so that was the motivation for her and she was in ... to me\nWell she's an incredible woman you must have talked to her ... she has his mission and human rights activist and twenty twelve Nobel Peace prize nominee which she pulled to the reason you choice to become a doctor\nActually that was not my first choice when I was growing up because how spread to me were second lake area we leave the next to the hospital\nSo the child that used to run and hide and play in the hospital and in our own family my both siblings and my father had to see the asthma\nSo I have seen and learned to med scene so early as age of ten nine new with injection means and everything to me it was a little bit boring\nAnd there's like no I Wonder if the story and I love history I used to listen old grandmothers who come into the house and\nMy mom's like no you didn't have a choice I built the hospital for you so my journey was chosen by my mother and I resisted when I was very young but ... civil war had been as age of Fifteen when I deliver first child\nAnd decided to where I have to be you know this is where my energy is more important than anywhere else so my delivery and my first child that made me\nTo accept my mother's plan you when you live with your first child Fifteen Fifteen I have no idea\nIn midstream background anything I had to watch this woman was my mom was doing the surgery and I'm running to them and to change that she is about to deliver and they say we in the middle of surgery just to\nGo look at it there and I'm standing next to this woman freaking out just screaming and she told in Manhattan and tells it like just told the child makes should they try to do some fall so and he's today twenty four years old and he's just to get\nMarried and then I'm so proud of him and said as I\nActually do incredible [laughter]\nAnd decode did you come across any of these IDs and your medical training of sex differences in terms of how we diagnose and treat patients because you were trained in Russia is that correct\nDefinitely for us as my mother's work and my work is just putting the woman's house first\nIs not the scientific level is just to give them access and being first in any state of coal come to a nation taking care of the only children and emergency but no one is thinking about the woman so\nThat's where we were thinking about it and as a woman has to have access to health care and it's a basic healthcare clean delivery\nAnd knowing about Dr Jackson's work it just makes more fascinating yes that's a few both both focus that the research should be\nPointed when you a practicing cardiologist how do you think your gender incensed you approach to your work\nAs a woman I think that women look at you\nSure with a certain level of trust and you as a woman also understand the context of women's lives so approaching women holistically that as such at the center of women's health\nIt's the intersection of the biology with what their social and environmental context in which they live as well as somebody the other factors that impact their lives like the legal structure and I think being a woman\nYou've lived that life and you think have a more natural affinity not that it can't be taught it can be taught but I Do think you're starting in a different place\nAnd you've had stopped it could when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make you were women\nIt's huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you in discussing sexual issues there Ninety eight percent of some other woman went to the F G and female genital mutilation so their challenges their difficulties they faced in you know\nAlso their rights biggest challenge you face in a position in Somalia is woman cannot content on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait or has been a brother or someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you this is your body you know you can do it it's just\nDifferent activities more if we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask what was your breakfast I you should ask my patients do they have you eaten you\nBecause she sometimes forget herself she has ten kids and she had been even eaten you know the you know she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take it into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you're taking into consideration and it comes to diagnose them\nI think for my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the\nPaternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right and one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came to being the a leading inside level was very extreme you didn't know in the condition in somebody we don't have blood bank\nSo we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact today that\nThe blood and and draw a divide so we used to go after you know six seven hours looking at ... and ... and she's good to go on a number of ... you cannot have the children you have to wait you have to do this given all this\nPatient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet and I was so you guys you know starting breach inherent you know you want to die you ought to do this\nAnd by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or ... children I'd just to get my second husband if I don't give him\nA child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shock you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader I started listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being a physician who or training to what that transformed my clinical skill and where\nWent to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you faced take all the first one to ask you about your work it focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for non because most treatments were designed for men no women went inside\nWell science has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research\nThey are far more frequently male animals\nViewers in here in United States and I got all the ideas information I learn how to improve my leadership so I'm trying not to be the only one defendant and everything so I give the leadership to a lot of leaders on the ground\nAnd poorly you the first African American president to Wellesley College in the United states and this is a prestigious women's college him he's alumni include Hillary Clinton Madeleine Albright what was it like to take on that role\nBut it was a great honor as you can imagine having a focus on women's health through my career and academic medicine to transition to a position of leadership\nAnd understanding not only how we prepare young women who are students to really make a difference in the world but\nAlso what is it that Wellesley College can also do to make the world a better place\nIn ... IV cooled women's health and equal rights issue as important as equal pay is it really is important\nWithout health what is there I think that we have to really focus on health and wellbeing as central to our equality and it is an equality issue as we think about\nThe work that we do here providing an environment in which young women can grow strong where they are educated but also where we focus on their health and wellbeing it's the totality it's a holistic\nApproach health and wellbeing and economic parity or in my mind and extra ... linked and societies that don't provide economic parity are most likely not providing parity as we think about health and wellbeing\nAnd decode what does it mean to you to be female community Nita\nMy community undermines you as a woman but being a woman leader I have more windows to have a conversation with men because I'm not fair to them so I could she didn't know community leaders elderly were loads and go in front of them have the conversation much easier than if I was in ...\nThey use the disadvantaged the country's things as a woman leader as advantage and that's how we save our community me and my mother was doing from a steady five years this work\nTo honor this very crucial to be a woman leader and woman on the table so that's that's the only way we can progress and bring peace in my country\nPoint what does it mean to you to be a female comedian cheetah\nIs a great honor to be able to use your voice to improve the lives of others and to have influence on\nVarious aspects whether it be policy whether it be here at Wellesley whether it be and how we carry out medicine both in the United states and beyond before I left academic medicine we\nHad produced a large policy report talking about the sex differences and pointed out where progress had not been made and that report was taken and what it led to was a very large policy change\nJust two years ago at the national institutes of health\nThat will now mandate the inclusion of women an adequate numbers in all phases of clinical trials but also mandate the inclusion of female cells and animals in pre clinical studies\nTo have that honor to work with my colleagues overtime to see that change happen it's what we live for\n... what do you think you take away from your conversation with pointless day\nIt's a ... of honor and [laughter] scratchy to just to be new with her and listen and I wish I could just listen not talk [laughter]\nOr the in the policies you're making a difference is you know I'm I'm so fascinating reading all the research and that will consider\nThanking the medication I'm given to my woman patient you to females patient how they will affect the body so I learned that from you ... and I'm very honored ...\nThank you [noise] deco I think the power of your dedication commitment\nAre enormous courage your boldness how you conceive of women's health and how you make that actionable in the most difficult of settings is truly an inspiration so thank you\nWell thank you teach those poor black and decker thank you for having is\nMy guest today would do that they couldn't hunted similarly inductive he runs a hospital in school with a new refugee camp in Somalia and dumped a pool of jumps and he's been at the forefront of the mission to get doctors to considered gender differences in medical research and treatment\nAnd back again next week with a brand new episode in the meantime you check out to all ... any updates on the conversation you might've missed or if you haven't already subscribed to report caused such BBC the conversation wherever you get you put costs thanks very sneaky\nThis was Colorado Public radio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

breaks you try to fix it and a\nTechnique was was simpler then so it was easier to fix but nowadays we no longer learn that we have no tools we have no skills and new products are around everywhere and they're not so expensive so\nWhen something breaks the road to a new item is much simpler easier than the road to having something we've had\nHim you talk about the little scale to the people don't have the skills anymore I'm not an ... works and depends on two things depends on as you mentioned earlier on people actually being prepared to bring that stuff and to get it fixed on the moon and the second thing it depends on\nThe other volunteers for them to kind of gave up that time and do this I'm going to all these repairs um where where did you find them how do you get in touch with people in the first place if you say that those new skills alone so some people do have\nIn in many people does nothing all communities my experience is that in communities there are still some people who do have the skills and the two and a time\nAnd who really like nothing\nMore than ... and fixing and they've been doing this for twenty Thirty years in many cases so that's my uh that's what I realized when and when I first organized suffers with that going to say it turned out to be not so very difficult to find these phone and tears because when you talk to people then\nEveryone says um oh you've got to talk to Joan he's always tinkering around in his uh\nAnd you're listening to connect us in or around in his shit I mean we can bring in Chris Lee who's in London hard Chris you run to RIMPAC campaign roasted nuts ethnic Cambridge arrived\nIn Russian yes whereabouts and miles from Cambridge\nAnd just just tell us you know what did you constantly get out of repairing stuff why don't you give up your time\nI think ultimately it's the satisfaction\nOf saying somebody's face when something is men that that they have a strong ... with that title was kind of have to be thrown away but they didn't want to try to why are they wanted to try and keep being used for as long as possible and I and I think earlier you mentioned about the sentimental value of of some\nItems such a big I'm a full throated right\nYeah it's not it's not just new checking you catches the between his soldiers electronic stuff um someone had a daughter and breaking earlier on just to read and write\nA company called blood from one of the or RIMPAC ... I was doing and a woman in a a God and folk\nAnd we worked out that it was a hundred years old is he and I said trust are going to go see if you could get a new handled\nPut his book and she said of course I could but it's it was my mother's garden for was her mother's garden for and it was bad hands that were working the soil with it and she said that's what matters to me it was a lovely story through several generations and about a hundred years\n... that's that's really a beautiful story in at the tip of coal RIMPAC cafe story and that's what a food you can play\nLeast the assessment for free and then maybe we say we're taking it to retire so we take out some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC cafe time have those shows\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get ... back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair should become cheaper\nNow for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is sex tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that's labor she'd be tax lower so that's\nA professional repairs have become more attractive in in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd um [noise]\nI I don't know of course there will be different or labor costs in different policies of well so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet [noise]\nAbsolutely yeah definitely [noise]\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work at just the costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff amended in the first place for whatever reason a lot of people just\nDon't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit to a landfill thought the other day have a listen to this why won't become to the ... today\nAnd I'm checking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThroughout this will be told and showed his brother yeah he found that ... I mean you say totally broken beyond repair all I don't know if he's he's still frightened ... holes in the middle East that what I mean I Wonder when someone could replace a missile POWs [noise]\nIf they laugh at what you think you can do [noise]\nSay that what you\nBelieve in something\nEven if it means sacrificing everything\nThat's commercial using the face and woods at the American football quarterback Colin Kaepernick\nThe reason is controversial goals is that dream crazy is the adage in title place directly\nOn Capitol next high profile role in refusing to stand when the American national anthem is played during NFL games he and other players were protesting the large numbers of deaths of African American use of the hands of police officers the so called\nBlack lives matter movement many American football fans didn't ... anti American when he kneeled during the anthem the Nike campaign this year also as a result prompted a backlash some consumers took to Twitter posting videos in protest\nNow only my burning my favorite pair Nike's your burning your sales you know how many other sneakers or to buy you're going to go ahead and say hey we stand where people who meal for the national anthem ball sorry Nike or buy a new for well past twenty plus years not any more\nFive pairs of shoes and they're all going to let them burn as like you decided to call them cabinet or a bad one you know just share the same opinion\nIn fact I was going to be Nike found Kaepernick is going to be your spokesman now\nI spent my whole life has a Nike man not no more though so that's how you're going to do it how much they harm on doing how you're going to put ... on the cover of your advertisements burn your shoes I like cats\nWell along with him president from past him self even tweeted in early September that in his words Nike was getting absolute he killed with anger and boycotts\nActually it hasn't been spilt Galloway is professor of marketing at NYU Stern school of business and he told me what happened to Nike shoe sales since the campaign began\nInitially there was some concern that the firm was alienating a core consumer group and you saw the stock took a hit the next day there are a lot of people that went on line very sort of vocal minority of consumers who burnt their nineties and the marketplace was concerned that they were alienating a core consumer base what's happened since then now is that it's apparent\nThis may have been actually a good thing the stock is more than recovered and touches\nAll time highs and if online sales are proxy for broader sales it looks as if their sales have noticed we picked up\n... how do you account for that given all of the negative publicity the public shoe Bunning that we've been seeing the tweets from Donald Trump complaining about Nike what's going on\nWell to borrow from Nike's tagline Nike just did it or specifically Nike just did the math Nike's sales are thirty five billion dollars twenty billion is registered outside of the U.S Fifteen billion domestically\nAmong that Fifteen billion two thirds are from consumers under the age of thirty five and if you're under the age of thirty five and\nCan afford a hundred and fifty dollar pair of Nike flying that racers you likely a skew towards a higher earner and maybe dwell in a city which means most likely you lean left\nShow by my calculations they'd probably wrist about one to three billion dollars of business domestically amounts at the high end whereas abroad that twenty billion dollars there are very few people outside of the U.S that would argue that the U.S is on the right track and is doing a good job of handling race relations so\nIn exchange for potentially alienating one to three billion about thirty five billion dollar franchise they strengthen the relationship with thirty two to thirty four billion so distinctive whether you think this was the right or the wrong thing to do it was absolutely the shareholder thing to do so in some Nike adjusted the math\nIt's interesting it's almost taking a leaf out of the Donald Trump playbook you might argue to galvanize urine coal supports even if it risks alienating alienating some some on the outside\nThat's all right great brands not only decide who they're for but who they are not for and they made a statement here it came across as bald it came across as authentic and genuine and it was just a great trade to potentially upset one to three billion dollars\nOf your consumer franchise about strengthening thirty one or thirty three was a fantastic nerve Nike has\nThe move to embrace Colin Kaepernick will go down as one of the better marketing moves in the last decade\nDo you think that's more broadly true that in the age of social media and the age where people are much more used to kind of shy acting out and perhaps opposing other people the fans that being ... kind of more okay than it was\nWell we're all hoping that sports would be kind of is a waste is from politics and it ended up at the last fire wall of politics sports has been breached so there's no escaping\nIt now what Nike was able to do with dominate the headlines and buy some standards or by some estimates garnered somewhere between a quarter of a billion and three hundred and fifty million dollars in free advertising this to a certain extent is taking up\nA page out of the playbook of Donald Trump who constantly dominates the headlines with controversial statements and also big tax that is known for not advertising why because they don't need to show Nike has gone to a great job hair grabbing the Mike back from other big tech and other consumer companies\nStill got away here on business daily from the BBC so is this the start of a white a trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor getaway suggest seeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than slashing at unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program\nBut we wanted to take it wider anyway some brands in the u._k. also taken to activism as a personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take Tim much in the founder and chairman of the British pub chain whether students\nAs a longtime you're a skeptic he came out ahead of the British referendum ... membership in twenty six dean as an ... even stuck that message on these pub match how does that affect the best sales like when did well\nWe'd been fairly apolitical it with a spoon for the first twenty or so years of our existence and the first thing that cool ma I was the debate over the euro and that is well it started the bull rolling so campaign successfully\nAgainst your own and then said nothing for a long time until the referendum when the country was given a choice like everyone else had to say what's the best for the future of the economy and for a company and decided to campaign that just ...\nRight but I mean it's one thing isn't it to take your own stand on that particular question it's another just to get on your band mats and to decorate your various pubs with that message\nWell that's right of course there were ... a lot of other people doing it to a lot of the foot sea hundred companies signed a lesser saying we'll definitely be better off if we stay in AAU\nBut did you worry about campaigning directly to your customers I suppose that's the question I mean there's one thing to go on the media and express your personal opinion it's another given that you know presumably fifty percent of your customers might well support staying in the\nI did worry about it I'd already done ... during the ... the euro era and the euro debate\nAnd the way that I see people except to do is unlike say the Financial Times or the times of the guardian in a magazine which is where I wrote a lot of my aunts uncles we had ... arguing the opposite of what I was saying so I think it helped us\nWe could say we are and organization which here's my view but we will print an equal number of articles with the opposite view\nRight but the match pretty one sided these days on the\nYeah the beer match you are right there ... or more one sided that they made the case for leave and I think people bully debates is required if you're going to make a good decision\nOn the debates is part of a democracy not everyone agrees with me over this late but you got guys like Michael O'Leary has made his first campaign in favor of remaining in the this is the head of Ryan and the head of hr on there\nAnd I think it's been accepted that Michael O'Leary says one thing to him says another and it's such a big existential questions for the economy but I think customers broadly welcome the debate\nThe thing about breaks it though is it has become as in it I mean a very divisive issue for many people something for the people who feel strongly about it as he even just talk right now a ... second referendum next year which would have to be even more divisive could\nHow would you go into that I mean again it would put you at all with a large subset presumably of your customers\nWell that's right I think it might put the roads with the subset of them I mean ultimately a rule was said to them look at the end of the day this is your decision it's a democracy that's what it's all about you decide what do I know but I think is democracies at stake under very important\nIssues for for freedom the economy liberty and so on I think it's right that there's this people speak out the public isn't stupid you know just because I make the case for leave doesn't mean they'll agree with me\nIs there any sign that it's ... you bought them and I\nStopped at a crossroads where many students were asking for money from
