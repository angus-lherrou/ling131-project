correspondent in the capital of the the ... thank you for making time for us on the program this morning Jonathan ... is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan you wouldn't know particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how we usually this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of course there's lots of a local culture and an on local\nUh practices that involves quite close contact with a dead body and so in past outbreaks we've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial took a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that if you can't get access to the communities\nOf course the other elements as well is this a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building and unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected you isolate them and then you monitor the contract so those people and if any of them become infected you isolate them and by just doing this\nIsolation ... contacts monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control because you can't do that if it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nWhat we haven't yet seen is that truly disruptive\nEnergy so so you know wind and solar and a wave energy they're all very good at making huge contributions who were just to for example in others it's very windy places Scotland

um President Putin or at least people close to him to send to agents to to poison people and so it's become an incredible because it doesn't seem as if the international community can then do anything about that\nQuestion quick question for both of you on this number going to turn to something else and that he's the President Trump has made it very clear he doesn't like walk crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is seemingly doing here but he's also very came not to in any way undermined a one hundred and ten billion dollar contract\nFor fighter jets upon which as he puts the U.S jokes Japan's now is President Trump here\nI joined us simply speaking plainly about a subject which perhaps other international leaders are making noises about human rights abuses but actually if there are contracts excite you know which way in the end they gonna come down\nI I'm not a big fan of President Trump but he did was called it correctly you know the the western world is a deeply involved in receiving Saudi money for her arms to various deals and of course they don't want to jeopardize our income\nLeslie yes not that's true um but I mean it's just curious just I mean six days ago Donald Trump was telling the world that Saudi Arabia wouldn't last two weeks in power are such American military support\nUm I I'm just seeming to call in the country to pay more for its own defense as indeed he's been saying to other members of NATO So\nYes I mean there's there's there's a law and play here but I think I'm a ... those people who are activists will have to put the pressure on all those sorts of newspapers in the u._k. um the u._s. have already pulled out of the conference that was mentioned\nAnd that's not a massive thing but that that's that's a commitment by those papers to keep this issue alive\nLeslie we talked earlier about the whole issue of Scottish independence not be reading you'd be looking at ... countries and and you you think there are some lessons to load\nWell and ... our our nearest neighbor's apart from at our neighbors and within Britain are that the Nordic countries at with whom we had a loss in common people like myself my family comes from the very north of uh Scotland and from New York in the islands which was actually owned by Norway until sixteen hundred\nAt but not far more recent late the Nordic countries helping racing ahead and almost every league table that tedious lay of the top of everything whether it's a literacy health and wellbeing child wellbeing loan ... um equality democracy\nAnd born dates GDP they're doing extremely well they're mostly small nations around five million people same population of Scotland\nAnd surely we can look across the water and not direction across the north sea and tried to see how we could be picking up on very per ad results for us in terms of health and wellbeing how could we do things better\nSo what do you think they are doing right that Scotland is doing wrong\n[laughter] I briefly and they've got a equality and batted right to the heart of their society and they have the smallest income gaps in the world they have the highest trust levels between citizens in government in the world\nAt they've they've managed to put their resources into excellent services so that middle class people are not going off to buy private education of private health\nAnd they keep the solidarity within the system they keep people paying taxes and they pay high taxes for high quality services\nSome of that solidarity might be beginning to crumble ... um that are conservative governments and some of these countries and the Norwegians have such a massive the world's largest oil ... because they had the ... the cleverness\nTo set aside the money coming in from oil and they don't actually use it and their everyday life\nBut of course ... people can make the calculation that there's probably millions of corona are for each individual Norwegian if they were to claim their own so I'm up until ... there's been a remarkable political support for keeping the Nordic Muslims it's cold\nAnd that would have to be something Scotland would look at but of course as a devolved government we don't have the power over taxes to make the big change is necessary to achieve dots redistribution of wealth that you have to have to have a a good sign of say\nOkay we will have more on this later as the we're we're going to go out to a Alistair Ross who has the sports news\nOr if I were going to start with the world anti Doping Agency who have been the dying claims that it signaled the views of athletes when I chose to lift the ban on the Russia anti drug agency last month is all through a BBC interview\nAnd waste leading athletes represents did on the committee said she'd been bullied by some of the organization's most senior officials to try and drop her opposition to the ... this accusation made by the Olympic skiing champion Becky Scott who resigned his seat on the committee at the wall or do you guys in seal water\nOff the decision was made to remove this band for widespread Russian state sponsored doping she says she was treated with disrespect bullied and faced inappropriate comments suggest you\nI think that there has been an incredible loss of confidence and faith in the beginning of the nation as a result of this [noise]\nI think the athletes have been galvanized by they're saying they have seen fit to expect a station on a level that I have never seen before I think we're seeing an unprecedented level of outcry if outrage and all they have the athlete's life as a result of this\nProblem ... bought a house now is this decision has been widely opposed by powerful national anti doping agency's and in fact since the interview\nThe head of the United states agency has called for a major changes water has admitted that was an atmosphere at the meeting but it was a result of strong and divergent views and it says the athletes voice has been clearly had\nTons of football and the qualifies for next year's Africa Cup of nations are we finally seeing a competitive calmer inside\nWhat it was a a tight one against the law where you well know in the end thanks to a

I always say that you can do and you're Garry Julia bedroom or your kitchen and what what really came to my attention last year was\nA story about a guy who was self medicating self treats and use ... Chevy infection so it was essentially injecting himself with some day in a in the hope is producing an antibody that would then kill him or at least control his his infection and I thought this is this this is crazy and you know it is this really happening\nAnd so we started to look around read around and and we thought it was definitely a a a radio series and in here\nI yeah I I've got quite a few questions softer that how on earth cannot be possible\nIt's incredible what you can do to yourself self experimentation is totally acceptable and of course the the thing is we've had great strides in the area of genetic engineering so muggy find your own genome for example a muddy find that the genetic material as as life in general\nAnd so all of these things have become more accessible that very cheap so it means that in essence you can do pretty complicated experiments in your marriage or in your bedroom and there are people trying to impose their own muscles to make themselves they get this is a technique that's been proven to work in animals\nAnd so you've got this whole meal bombed the people who were trying to do these experiments and advanced science outside the confines of the ...\nThis is all well and good but isn't it potentially incredibly dangerous\nPotentially dangerous to to the people who do it to them on the whole generally find out the what's needed that knowledgeable people they they know the risks but it's still doing things outside of the convention of no more regulation and so that has to be a risk\nAnd you're doing this these people aren't doing this at higher let me just give me an idea of the kinds of conditions you mentioned mentioned muscles that but what what could you do to yourself well\nAnything that we could do in the lab in theory you could now too in in a in a a ... a well equipped\nA carriage will or basement to your house so things like changing your muscle was was was the famous one but those the chap who tried securities HIV will control these I tried the with the production of an antibody using a piece of DNA the next experiment to his guns changes to remove ourselves from his body\nManipulate those cells genetic and he said that they lack the protein that the virus needs to get into the cell and then injecting them back into his body in again in the hope of controlling the infection so they can do very complicated things\nWhich we do and we see in clinical trials around the world but that because I Do now and themselves they don't have all the rigmarole of guns for ethical approval and another\nThing I'll hit a lost cause yeah a scientist so you actually sort of secretly quite pleased when people do this because that doing experiments that that would take you years\nI wouldn't say will please because obviously one of the the reasons that we have these regulations in place is to protect people because there are risks and you assess risk but it does raise the ... the discussion about whether or not regulation\nHas become incredibly inhibit tree to progress things to to use in humans suffer example\n... if I were at the at the outset to the program some of the vaccines are not being used in in the boat and they had to be fast track through the regulation so that we could use them and I think it's it's this whole thing about housing now go to the point where it's hindering progress\n[noise] bio hacking you heard it here first and you have is that you made a whole radio series about this which you can find on the BBC website Leslie ... tell me about capping hops\nAnd says it jumps and stories student at the animal yes it's such grace hey well and and again looking at the door to expect across the world that she late and we did latitudes and lots of people have literally wouldn't ... to the weekend\nIt's most common actually in Norway they have the highest rate of not in the world that you can tell that there is a part one hot for every seven Norwegian so that's really one for family and it stretches right across the the northern hemisphere Canada America all the Nordic said the Russians the checks the Germans\nAnd then down in the southern hemisphere that didn't use the hunters are famous for their patches\nCome straight one country is that ... that doesn't have this tradition as Scotland so I've been doing a PHD for eight years at comparing Norway and Scotland ... traditions partly because I was eccentric enough to have a ... and ... and myself with no electricity no running water\nAt way out in the top of the hell's wasn't everybody's ... I loved it and I think actually far more people would get genuine relaxation\nUm if they could get away from physically get away from absolutely everything and not be seeking the chemical release of alcohol which is usually how people escape and\nI'm guessing the reason there's a different tradition in Scotland is land rights\nAnd says and it's just so difficult to get a little patch of land\nAnd there's four hundred and thirty two and ... people who own half the private ... might think well I didn't know we saw a lot to south electoral that's that's very very small Norway has tens of

some persons at the beginning to was told a nationalistic stuff but they were just a little ... minority but now that I read that the majority and they add to absolutely power in the eye ESP\nSo why was the policies that you found it so attractive to well I hate to use the word but racist\nI think ... um the cause of the demand that the euro or should be replaced was a Dutch mock [laughter] so that was maybe a signal to them that this is a nationalist party\nWhat was the final straw for you when did you decide to walk out\nThat was a terroristic attack at the ... flats in Berlin and I did

its position on most things is pretty well known and understood by everyone isn't it\nBut there's been much turbulence in the western Balkans recently from allegations of Russian interference in Macedonia in Montenegro to the election of a subset protest to the presidency of Bosnia\nMr Stoltenberg says that means that makes sense for NATO to strengthen its cooperation with Serbia\nThe

women's technology achievements [noise]\nNow in the race to find the applications to off the official intelligence healthcare\nIs seen as one of the most promising areas Chinese and American films are investing heavily to develop medical advances using AI this week China's ten cent unveiled a partnership with a small London medical tech firm met a pet to use a guy in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease\nThey developed a technique which involves video during a patient's hand movements to work out how far the condition has progressed\nBut what does it say about the Chinese firms ambitions to be a global leader in a guy I spoke to Dr way fan who runs the ten cent health AI lacked the medical\nLab we are focused on very deep clinical problems of Parkinson's is one of a according to a recent report if the wind of this a chronic condition in China that bothers me\nUh so we're looking for to use your our technology to help the doctor and the patients and improving quality of care\nNow lots of people are doing this kind of thing where they are they ... around the world where is ten cent in this race because it is a race\nOr we are ... other company we want to solve the problem the entire problem ended and\nAnd uh we are only interested in a very clear your clinical problems either by working with doctors and the from the very beginning and the value dated in a clinical setting and globally and hopefully you know uh getting approved by the authorities or we can apply those in the real world\nDo you have the sense that this research is further ahead in China than in say the United states which is obviously the other place where vast amounts of time and money is being spent\nA vote in this particular problem we are ... are we say we're pretty much a devised you know you might expect but we are the talents are we we're and we are happy to work you know tolerance in boats I Am the medical field\nNow oil companies involved in this kind of research or or eventually looking for a pay back but it does tend to give you plenty of time to achieve a paperback\nOf for the moment I think of the information is we want to make sure we can help people while you'll casual people helping Dr hopping society will be a pay back eventually so in what formula pay by ... or or the moment I don't have information to disclose\nBut it's fair to say that ten cent these aims to be a leader and this whole field is ... a very ambitious program\nYes we are very ambitious and we are very interested in a shopping patients of doctors and using our platform our tolerance to help as much as we\nDon't ... away from the ten cent medical but shouldn't go to a painting a picture of collaboration around the world to to to to find out what's going on are you there I in in health but actually there's a big sort of baffled isn't that between American Sean here\nI'm sitting there you have big companies on on the you know any of the country I'm putting ... billions into a ... I think some of the the difficulties as a ... on the you know this kind of research takes years decades\nOr to sort of ... significance are dating we are going to see I significantly adults in the health care anytime soon and I you know these companies going to have to commit to spending my money for very long time to achieve anything useful\nIts report that talks about the compromising the economy about renewable energy electric cars even capturing C. O. two from the atmosphere wanna headline from oil company ... must have read for station\nThat point the report was into the territory of agriculture the business of feeding the seven billion and rising mouse on our planet itself a major source of greenhouse gases\nSo appropriate a second report appeared in makeshift just shortly afterwards headlined ... since the keeping the food system within environmental limits examining looked just the climate but all the ecological impacts of farming\nLead off a marker spring when came into the studio told me the pointless to see where sustainability nice food security\nThe environment in health I really two of the fundamental pillows that determine welfare broadly defined so we started from the point that we have to be able to feed a growing population in the future a healthy diet\nWithout wrecking the environment so therefore we looked at both healthy dietary patterns and ways to limit the environmental impact of the food system\nAnd you then break the impact status of five category so I think the principal water which is the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide and so but as a whole range of aspects that you're looking at\nYeah what we know is that the food system really has tremendous impact on the environment on the range of different issues you named greenhouse gas emissions but it also occupies about forty percent of the earth land surface it extracts Seventy percent\nOf global fresh water resources and over application of fertilizers has already led to dead zones in oceans where you don't have oxygen anymore and fish died\nSo he goes fertilizers or things like large traits which are manufactured in big factories and then put from ... fields\nEver looked at nitrogen and phosphorus application those are the two big chemicals that are also responsible for a classic pollution Monday run off the field\nBecause then comes to the second step in your analysis this idea of a pilot treat boundary [noise] they seem to be said as it comes to me\nYeah they're a little bit vague so they are intended to describe a safe operating space for humanity so if we don't see them then we're sort of find we at conditions that we know we can operate with\nAnd the idea is if you're a seat them then you run the risk that something goes have access to say so to give you an example for climate change it would be if we pass a certain limit for example one point five degree warming to degree warming then we have a higher occurrence of extreme weather events drought flooding and song\nFor phosphorus and nitrogen we might have excessive pollution of water systems with more occurrences of those dead zones and also with the other ones have you ... you would interfere with ecosystems be at farmers are to global hydroelectric cycle\nIn your house or supplies to now I'm twenty fifty so simple question aren't we already operating beyond the private ... got sense\nYes we are we know that we have already emitted quite a lot of greenhouse gas emissions so the climate change boundaries really at risk of being crossed and we also know we are in several regions applying to much fertilizers so those two things already into danger soon to say\nThat to go back to the feet security if we're already over ... marks are you looking at some areas by which we could go on feeding a bigger population while reducing this impacts\nYeah absolutely or at least not increasing them right I mean for fertilizer application we need to reduce for greenhouse gas emissions we need to reduce but there are several things at our disposal with which we can do that I mean we know that some regions really over fertilized they don't need to fertilize that much to crops will grow with a bit less fertilizer is well\nSame with a bit less water use so a big part of this whole scenario exercise is really\nWhat needs to be done globally and in different regions so if we were to let's say ... the application of fertilizers from over ... reaches to and applying regions then we wouldn't have a net increase but more food available for people\nI mean it sounds hopeful but on the other hand if people are applying to much fertilizer even now suggests that you're dealing with people who are making very good decisions\nThe thing is they don't have good tools at their disposal either so we know if you really properly money into how much you apply to fields and if you know how much your crops need then you can really be a balance that much better and some countries mostly in high income countries have those technologies and they don't over fertilize to that degree\nSo it's really a question of how can you make available those best available management practices to a growing number of regions predominantly low income regions\nThat said the production and the other one which we're often told me about your world surveys is about the ... the change of diet this off the clock Newport pressure it all of this as the world becomes richer\nYeah exactly we know that once people have more money they usually spend it on so called higher value foods and among those are meat products but also fruits and vegetables but processed foods\nAnd we know that isn't very good for your health nor is it very good for the environment because many animal source foods have a high impact on the environment just because they're so inefficient converge rates of feet into calories that we eat\nYourself some basic I was expecting you to come in and sort of be do being gloomy and you seem to see a lot of hope it all the fish and the other ... to this is as a huge amounts of starvation even now even with a inefficient system\nYeah that's right we know though that we could already now feeds the current population much more healthy leave without all that stuff ... so a problem is really inequality in the food system so high income countries consume too much lower income countries consume too little and almost everybody consumes the wrong stuff\nSo if we went to visit gay re aligned food system and really clearly communicate what is a healthy diet then I think we would be in a better place\nAnd this is the weeks the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change has come out with a special reports\nAbout one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably you've ...\nIdeas that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change\nWe know if that were not happen then for example if we could expect reductions in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them unhealthy air\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if ...\nOh no no trajectory what we projected might be an underestimate actually\nMarkers spring been from the Oxford Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put fear to into the atmosphere and they'd really false making cool to have well generational ready and moving with good by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and some of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just\nThink of how much power winter that makes and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most a\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest as heat and the energy of evaporate water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nIs a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate constantly\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a win for him so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect of the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night when turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nWith a sweaty fingerprint and what was

is all the metabolites will be struck residues that are excrete in sweat and were able to detect\nBombs so it's just really a question of analyzing whatever's in that sweaty mark exactly ... and that's a simple prices is it ... I mean is presumably wants to be simpler than doing it with your ...\nIt's very simple so far up detection method we use cartridge that is very similar to a pregnancy test\nYou put your thumb print town just five seconds later you can remove your thumb and there's enough sweat that for us to be able to determine whether you're taking any one of four different types of drugs I mean imagine\nThe ... the tiny this is really sensitive chemistry\nVery sensitive indeed we're looking at pictures grams of drug\n... billion ... executive and you're able to actually detect and this is actually widely done with people\nYes we what can with a number of different groups ... recently where you work with a chef who coroner to establish that there is sufficient sweat on the\nFingers of deceased people\nAnd the sweat was sufficient so that we could detect whether\nThey had died of an overdose of a particular drug will sort of drugs you talk about we're looking at four different classes of drugs I kind of this group of trucks amphetamines opiates which includes morphine and other pain relieving trucks and cocaine\nIn these instances with Carlos says these are people who have died how long have they been dead for it's a pretty grim question how good would the fingerprints that you were getting from them compared to people who are alive\nThe whole study that we have done was conducted by three different more trees in the u._k. we wanted it completely anonymous we didn't know how long these people have been some being dead very recently others not so\nAnd it was completely randomized so that we just didn't know how long people being in the ...\nThe house I said was the test on those variations or was it was good\nIt was always good remarkably clearly if a person had died and was in the water for a long period of time than the buddy would've decompose very much more rapidly than have they been in control conditions in Moultrie\nAnd if you will to do this presumably there is a desire for very simple way of doing these tests with people who've died\nSo at the moment to be able to establish the cause of death a full ... investigation has to happen that very expensive four to six hundred pounds per person and this is a very simple way of establishing whether the intelligence to the person has died of an overdose\nTo establish whether that's the case will know\nIt is used as a kind of a screening device where you then say okay we're going to do a more detailed analysis or can you get sort of quantitative information out that this person must have had so much ... for example so much drugs before they died\nIt is a screen so we're looking to see if there's the presence of that truck is there in the body and then the toxic logical rip you can establish the exact concentrations in\nIn that case a false positives and issued a false positives even\nYou always have to worry about false positives false negatives we've established that the accuracy of this is very high so we're comparing results with the toxic logical data from blood analyses where over Ninety percent thrilled focus drugs up to Ninety nine percent in some instances\nOne floor and all of this you're looking for stuff which is on the fingerprint which you think is being sweat suit but presumably as I Walk around the building I can pick up the cause of contaminants and that may give a full story about how I pay ... a drug metabolizing\nYou're absolutely right for a live person clearly the easiest ways to wash your hands\n... with paper towel and then Fifteen minutes late enough sweat on your fingertips to be able to give us a new sample the other thing that we're doing is protecting the metabolites rather than the actual parent molecule so we know that the body has metabolize truck and then excrete should it\nMakes sense to me David Russell bringing a chemical automation to fingerprint analysis I'm bringing to an end this edition of socks and action which was produced by robots I'm running piece on our Web page at BBC will say the so called has links to more information on everything in the program and to port costs of our politicians\nYou're listening to end up news from\nColorado Public radio on Ninety point one FM Casey of our Denver fourteen Ninety A.

hear more from the site of an Islamic school which was buried under a pile of mud and debris ... that around ten people students and teachers were inside the school when the landslide happened\nAnd and so we're trying to figure out a various different reports coming in as to how many people have\nHave died or are still missing from that site\nAnd we've been seeing more and more landslides in Indonesia ... why is\nThis well in Tunisia is in that famous Pacific ring of fire which is is susceptible to all sorts of things earthquakes volcanoes and now really the landslides are becoming more and more of a problem that's because a deforestation is is an issue people are pushing further and further into\nInto places that were once jungle clearing those places away clearing hold mountainsides away and that coupled with climate change when when climate change happens a drought effects that cleared land creates big cracks in the land\nAnd then when we see the opposite of that

different organizations and individuals they're all coming together under the banner\nIndivisible and they say that the demonstration and I'm quoting here for an open and free society ... instead of

recently\nYeah I mean if you like being a bit of a summer of protests I actually have in Germany or you know three years since I'm a medical and welcomed refugees into this country and migration politics still is bringing people out on the streets I mean\nThose are far right demonstrations most notably of course in the town of cabinets um in September and around those protests when now starting to see other parts of society mobilizing tens of thousands of people\nComing together to protest so far rights marches that we've seen on the radio starting to get a sense that loss of
