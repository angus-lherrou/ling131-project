treated as different\nAnd you know and Martin Luther king this very sanitized kind of white should've Martin Luther king that floats around\nMartin Luther king didn't just say well we all want to be Americans why can't we all the American he was not a he was not ... in that way he understood that certain groups were excluded from what was pretending to be a universal ideal and he was saying that in order to achieve\nEquality of citizenship African Americans hatched a such that rights to civil right yeah I mean I\nLiterally ... you're the one who making is making a slightly of simplified binary because you I either describing a position which a race doesn't matter at all and we're just against injustice and be abstract and we don't recognize his ... ways in which obviously has been instantly as racial injustice\nUm oh everything needs to become about identity and but we should have lose out of science ... society where met us led I think it's I don't think ... between how Martin Luther king and Broadway bronco bomb it talked about those things\nAnd how some people just basically into politics I'll talk about it is it they said\nWhy should we care for example when African Americans are being discriminated against and how do we argue about that the majority population and one of the ancestors\nYou claim to care about universal principles you claim to care\nAbout the principles in the constitution and when you look at the American south right now you see these principles are being violated so you as an American have a reason to struggle against injustice Adrian time beyond we have some common as Americans and that is the right way I think ... ...\nBy off for an ad on failed identity politics that I was given black lives matter and I showed it to you from the accepts that we just listened to that black lives matter will not say we are different\nI drip have wild but the point is you have to build bridges between differences so that people can build a common life and have a meaningful democracy in an economy that is actually open tools to the point about identity politics as very exclusive was a sense of belonging that everyone can shatter needs to redo the ...\nYou can I throw in a a different element or if that is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now\nFrom say a civil rights movement to the sixties city that many more people have access to these ideas have access to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that ... with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is an American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that but I'm saying it's a function of people being wealthier having more access to\nTo having a voice because they can access the media because they can\nHave social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't ... yourself a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character the conversation that's being had on line\nFrom the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a\nTendency toward predation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more woke\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth to white identity politics\nIs it the ... that actually is destructive if there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf there is a bent on us it is one that has been set up by the majority [noise] this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nSet protests them all in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim narratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your last ... outrageous though is\nThat rather an important point Adrian past is it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nOr the the problem is that you have on the one hand very technical aspect can lead spinning struck things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people on the one hand and then you have lots of minority\nJoshua responses to dodge and nothing none of it is very healthy it's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any ... any sexuality whatever the real victims Israel oppression mixed protection but\nThe way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be X Y or Z that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would just simply don't recognize that but that's exactly in fact what\nThe tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white American goal and sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which that movie er which tells the mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was Popova left but some food that was problematic exercise leaving me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between\nCultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation\nWe have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all things from the same sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we coached on politics until it kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNot allowed to bring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to come into pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nWell I think the um Trump phenomenon in the United states are definitely does some of its rise to a identity politics and it's it in a reaction against it the shrill note that I observed earlier is alienating to the majority and if\nI saw the statistics recently I Wish I could quote them but the\nProportion of white Americans who believe that they are the primary victims\nOf discrimination in the United states is shockingly high and of course I look at that and I say well that's ridiculous but it's you know that's what they feel and it's partly the results of of fifty years of affirmative action so you know they feel discriminated against\nAnd um they look at what is often a a certain amount of casual racism against white people in the identity politics conversation\nAnd think that will you know someone has to stick up for us and you know I wouldn't simplified the Trump phenomena as only coming from this small campus movement but it hasn't helped\nAnd this way of of talking about people and prioritizing issues has definitely instructed the Democratic party and is also alienating middle of the road and independent voters who might otherwise be on board\nPre I Wonder how you view this this changing of the political landscape\nYeah well that's a couple of things to say I'm really struck by the way in which he does in fact a sudden form of white identity politics um that brought the Trump to power everyone else's child should identity politics and not the majority but the majority is playing\nA is being made to play for all the identity politics what I find interesting is the ways in which although we talk all the time about how fat snaps and help the truth matters and how fake news has a problem [laughter]\nSuddenly feeling the hurt feelings of the majority of become the basis on which entire country is run their elections I mean what else feelings\nIf I feel that there are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the staff affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people nowhere near proportional into academia for instance on the\nAffirmative action is upsetting but it just that have any bearing\nWith reality are we discussing reality when all the facts what is the truth well on the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really said it's just the city as river sexism the point is that racism and sexism are about Alice tucked\nOkay so you can't really punch up well you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people do suffer structurally\nYeah Sherman races so a few points you first of all unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and the democracies you have to ... somewhat about the feelings of the majority because otherwise you vote for people like Donald Trump and but as it does offer for everybody especially for the most vulnerable so what I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections\nAround ideals that are going to help us come together as a society and help us fight discrimination rather than ... and so the reason to cabbage and feelings of people is that in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a political\n... let facts we can't we can't ... and the name of field\nI think I'm I'm Talking about in country as the other thing is that I I Do find it quite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think is actually accurate\nAnd Vince it ended up so defined to counter that with different kinds of I didn't know what I Would say that well actually I Know Donald Trump ... it was in my mouth I didn't finish not bringing about Trump precisely shows what's the problem is with the conception of politics because we're going to fight for our group and for our side\nWe don't care about anything else prayer\nSo we shouldn't have affirmative action because that upsets white people for the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised groups fair access to writes in order that the majority and not be hurt\nHimself I but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including vast majority of people of color and the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on ... I wanted to move away from that point and bring you in\nA dream we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the establish policies actually have no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should you not like the\n[noise] I mean it's a big uh issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites establishments simply on representative\nThat often very smoothly groups and yes often do you watch any groups but then as I said groups which actually been bringing about the system is unjust off her father why people and many more so it's not the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot majorities in since ... working class populations in certain countries I've simply not being the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all that kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last ... years in terms of the two the two main policies\nThat come in on that place um I find that the W. W. see the white working class has a very interesting construct\nWell kinks off as as a whole have not done while on the working class as as a whole or not white that they ... white people but they're all working classes were being at the shop end of globalization up near liberalism of capitalism\nIf pressed their ... because they're working ... not because they're white there is no evidence to tell us that the white looking classes are doing this for\nAnd it looks bad as compared to let us say the Latino all black working\nClass which is an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German state elections into that area what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see su which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been\nHemorrhage face the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant AFDC on the other meanwhile the S.

D. which is the leftist sent about ... ... ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have clear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say hey if the anti immigrant or you know I'm lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into these\nWell I think now because the mainstream parties on offering something that's inclusive an off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working class has suffered in often suffered more than the white working class but\nSaying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered you happen to be wide also you know will rebel against the status quo and and who reached to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much less than half of all there's not as much as I said I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe're able to be most depressed people in the early ... an in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not that was approaching and built in a rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe ... we have people who embedded in relationships institutions are a lot since feelings do methane and just say so longing and if you're unable or unwilling to place to people to communities and countries might just be kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage and now she has been loaning so who onto west and east policy of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense and on the longing that actually ... the identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement shouldn't saying on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nIn northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their try than they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully and advocate for their interests not the larger interest\nBut their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door a bull in some ways it was if you'll know\nRendered Modi in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India\nIt wins bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and where we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nThe pasta older needs new classes or new groups come on the block and simply want to claim the hierarchy for themselves rather what we should have this is a ... actually works Ron Rose challenge vacations and actually give everyone a sense of dignity which hasn't been and Priya what a recognition\nOn our kids held the gas is kind of a liberal fundamentalism that we always have higher all can what matters is what kind of hierarchy we have\nI you know I'm all for the human imagination and the human imagination has many times through history and in many places envision world without hierarchy what people are in fact able to be at once individual\nAnd part of the collective good so I actually don't boy we talked about you know the extreme left in the extreme right we need to talk about the extreme sent to an extreme liberalism\nAs well you know these are the banal ideas about high rocky and tribalism and this is the way that human beings are and always will be I don't think that is the case I think human beings have all I\nThink the imagination involves second political imaginations change no\nReal idea what that meant but um no I Know it clearly I'm ... I Want to go back to what kind of society we should and visit and and imagine I'm On the question you asked about whether it'll ever be possible to get away from your identity entirely\nI'm for liberal democracy which means but I'm for society where people have a a great amount of freedom and fashioning on life and that means that some people will deeply identify with the groups of him and say\nI was born a religious Muslim and I want to be able to not just not be white but\nWhere for example the headscarf and be accepted as a full member of the society and treated a with equal dignity and respect\nBut very much live within my comment um sent in my life around ... percent of my life around ... kinds of things at the same time oh it's a thing I Want to live in a society in which the same person can grow up and make the choice about where to come from the time to come from a skin color religion is not an old important to them and they don't want that to play a very large role in the lives at all\nAnd at the moment I think the vision that society which has doubled freedom is W ... it's ...\nFrom the radical right it's ... some people are like Donald Trump who want to discriminate you don't want to recognize people have different skin causing them as these as equal but it's also affecting from people who say\nEverything is identity everything's going to be your top national belonging and there's no getting away from that agent is that how you use it a a a democracy that threaten from the radical right on the radical left almost certainly as an Sosa threatened by that kind of a high liberalism\nThat says that we're just all ruthless isolates individuals or nothing in common with anyone else so we we want to I think generally limited all those extremes and get back to the conversation about belonging about the things that we haven't come and his workers\nAs men and women and people of other you know orientation\nAs people who live in the same places as citizens I think it's that conversation about blowing that matters rather than you know keep emphasizing the differences in saying that somehow\nWe can imagine some sort of utopia without no distinctions all or you know differences in in in roles whatsoever I'm according for liberal extremism ... remark what I'm calling for as a society that recognizes people for the different roles and talents implications\nEnded affords public you know dignity to everyone and dignity means being respected for all sorts of roles you've played for the relationships you have not being forced into warm identity oh into just being a inoculations\nVigil free of very briefly ... is that the world your championing a hyper liberal one where everybody that goes back into the separate identities\nHardly I don't think anything on sets today has um attended in that direction and in fact I've I've no idea who these mystical people are hoping claiming this I think what we need to be looking at quite simply is who has wealth and power and who is in fact inflicting suffering and\nExploitation on other people and focus on that an off the real questions instead of having a false debate about how people who wants to be able to use women's box rooms let's say are uh you know a responsible for the rights of racism I think that's just a\nA a really kind of a surreal discussion that we have sometimes at the expense of looking at actuality it's not no Shriver\nWell as a novelist and they'd person\nUm I get concerned that the identity politics in much like that just that last comment is now trapping us into a world where we think all that matters is human hierarchy that that's the only conversation we ever have identity politics has been very concerned of course with\nWho's privileged who's on top who's been more disadvantaged you know life and the world\nAre bigger than that and I don't want to live in that in that space I Want to be able to talk about architecture\nAnd all that so that's it for this week on the real story Lionel Shriver\nPreempt other Gopal Adrian ... thank you very much if you'd like to listen to the program again or any other from the ...\nYou can listen back on line by setting the b._b._c. the real story if you'd like to speak program make sure you never miss another edition\nSubscribe to the ... you can find a simply by searching for the real story and you'll ... stop and we'd love to ... ... email us the real story at BBC ... ... e K O treat me ... for me with Russia and the whole team that's the real story for this week thank you for listening\nYou're listening to Casey a far from Denver case the FCAT and Boulder on H.

a lot of arm twisting and a little bit of threatening litigation we managed to convince to possess or to voluntarily give it back to the church\nI can imagine that the people you who's on you're twisting a very very reluctant that's right I mean do they know most of the time that they are in possession of stolen\nAll they knew it was dodgy okay they claimed that they bought the piece from a you Cade dealer who was specializing in sculpture when in fact we discovered that this dealer was actually arrested for smuggling cocaine inside of sculptures\nAnd it was the threat of a BBC story they were covering it at the time\nThat convinced this dealer to relinquish the sculpture but it's it's a significant loss presumably if money on the deal is signed well you know what money really didn't change hands they traded things amongst themselves to get the peace up to a value of about fifty thousand pounds\nWhich is what they demanded before they voluntarily\nRelease the work but we refuse to pay them I Try to beat them down with the law and morality to return the object without demanding\nSome sort of payments on what what's best a mixture of voter depends who you are dealing

twist I'm [laughter] I'm just trying to imagine that kind of conversation how that works\nWhere the art world Sixers people come to us and say look I've got something that I Know stolen I don't want to be arrested I I don't want my name in the paper I Want to cooperate and get rid of it can you help me\nAnd we are asked to keep things out of the press in exchange for cooperation which is something we can offer so go to the price is one of your ways of all I'm too high off a that we use it as a weapon sometimes name and shame they have slowly I mean there are people who are well heeled

paintings missing\nSince Nineteen forty and I know where some of them are I Know where one of them is right now in Switzerland\nAnd there was a very uncooperative dealer in Hamburg I Would like to get back piece back so in that particular reason why is that dealer refusing to cooperate why have you'll threats not with the well he sold it to his client so he knows he's on the hook for the money if his client has to give up the painting\nHe's gonna have to reimburse a significant amount of money that's why he doesn't want to cooperate it's all about greed it's all about money\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Nazi looted works of art still out there in the marketplace perhaps six seven hundred thousand objects and not all top ... but you know tourist squirrels and other important religious objects that are just gone\nSo is the art will do you think doing enough to stop this or you can find a lot of people coming here and praise the big auction houses ... afraid to criticize them because they are so powerful\nBut I'm not one of those people the major auction houses maintain restitution departments to make sure\nThat Nazi looted works of art are researched and then funneled through the

so I was very young and I had no idea about what happened\nAnd I discovered many things after my mother died now I must say that I've got tons of questions but it's only five or six years ago that I was told that\nThere were a paintings that belonged to my grandfather ... ... what did I must have been quite a shocking revelation [laughter] yes it was a huge shock and awe after a few weeks\nI've been told that that I was investigating on the property of the painting and the American government decided that it's your painting so they're going to give it back to you\nSo I was a yes\nYou did not

I'm not interested in participating in these elections because we go to several times but the MPs that had been elected and not served a insecurity and policy has increased more over the process is

dealings with a ton of on on behalf of the United nations so how does he think these elections will do\nThe best hope is that they pass off relatively peacefully and there is a ... an agreed outcome people can agree on who got elected to parliament but there is a a very real risk that the elections will be messy because\nThose who are trying to run the elections are facing an incredible task much of the country is controlled by the Taliban the console pulling their\nThis means that turnout may end up being much lower than in previous elections but it also can introduce distortions in to the allocation of seats\nAre for example there in a province if it's insecure in one area and relatively secure in another area than if the people only vote in one part of the province only their

places I think people have concluded that if you keep your head down don't challenge the Taliban have no dealings with the government you'll be okay\nBut the chances of getting on in life the chance of doing the kinds of things that well people in poor places off to do try to get a job in the city working with the government those options are all cut off\nAnd is a Taliban controlled area a Taliban run area by which I mean all their services can you live a life get a job feed your children\nWell certainly the Taliban have a rudimentary administration but it's not like a normal government they have an administrator that they put in sort of in charge of each district there are four hundred districts in the country oh they basically trying to your presided over law and order\nAnd a lot

operations [noise] so what are they doing I spoke to cover all kinds of pets as he's German\nAnd he speaks on behalf of the nature resolute support mission in Afghanistan\nOr support mission of NATO is a non combat mission\nSo we are not deploying troops anyway this country NATO will not have a role on Saturday the whole security is the hand of the Afghan police and they ask an army the African

NATO is not involved in this negotiation\nBut I'm guessing that you might have worked in other parts of the world where former enemies become political or I suppose pot and that was to try and bring conflict to an end\nI think uh your right to different parts of the whole before but I don't dare to speculate here in Afghanistan Afghanistan\nIs a very special place wall toll on for more than\nForty years already the crossroads that we are at right now requires let's tell a bomb at first\nTo take a serious decision which way they should go all day going forward towards a political settlement or will they stay on the path of\nViolence and committing horrible acts against the civilian population over here\nNATO spokesman kind of connect pets as well what is it that the ... what
