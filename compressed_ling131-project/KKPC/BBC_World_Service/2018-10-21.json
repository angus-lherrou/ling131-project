don't think any\nOf the audio tapes have made it to the United states yet or at least I'm not aware that they have\nSo I think this is still a few days from maturing but uh no I Do not mind why they upset plausible at all and actually I think it's very much hurt their credibility around the world is certainly has here in our country\nWhat is the best way down for to go about establishing the truth\nIf the Turks actually have this audio tape and I realized that they don't like their modes\nOf collecting intel to be known but I think they need to go ahead and share those with the United states and with the United kingdom and other countries so that we can go through that and that would be the way to end this and for everybody to know exactly what happened if those tapes exist\nWithout those types I still think that it would be very apparent to me that this is Saudi responsibility and\nFrom my perspective I Would tend to believe at this point that it was at the highest levels of government so while I Know they're looking at if you will dealing with twenty three are twenty four people in their own country and prosecuting them my sense is that this couldn't have happened without NBS his approval and if we're all\nAlready so sad to say you are you are saying that it is your belief that crime prince Mohammed bin some members directly implicated in the mud or all from Jamal ...\nYeah based on what I Know today and they're still more to be known and I may be proven wrong\nBut my belief today as if this is something that was probably ordered by NBS\nCarried out by people ah who are close to him and that he was murder now we may find other information soon but the fact that they have continued to put out non credible stories like the one they've just put out about him getting into a fist fight with them and being killed\nThose non incredible stories even make me more so believe that this is something that uh they're trying to shelter the person at the very top of their game\nIf the United states should game possession of ... video evidence if it indeed exist and it does demonstrate\nAs the Turkish media has been saying that ... she was tortured and to spend but inside the Saudi ... how van should the United states proceed\nWell it's my sense in talking to some of the other and ... that many of the western countries are looking to the United states for leadership on how all of the countries the western countries if you will shed respond but my sense is that\nWe collectively need to figure out a way to do that and that that entails conversations between us we all have some or\nIf you will interest in Saudi Arabia I don't know that I can give you a specific answer I Know that uh I'm committed to working with secretary of state palm pale and others\nTo figure out people on the other side of the ... to figure out the appropriate way forward and we need to be thoughtful about it I mean we need to\nWe need to realize that uh you know Saudi Arabia is a very unusual place none of us have a lot of insight into who the next later might be if in fact NBS is not the leader so this is one of those things where none of us need to react with pure emotion winning\nThink this through and make sure that whatever it is worth doing or doing in a coordinated way but look I I think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nTo that extent do you think western governments ... perhaps too quick to embrace crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man and a wrong to believe that he was a reformist you know if\nYou sit with him he has a very impressive individual when he talks about the future of the country and privatizing aramco and diversifying into other areas and making sure the country's future is not just focused on fossil fuels but diversifying to take care of the nation to future ...\nPatients are his willingness to take on the the most fundamental August and the country to do some progressive things and they happen both for human rights and other reason so if you listen to those things he's very impressive\nBut then if you watch and he's made a number of rookie mistakes I mean what a dead end cutter and the white did it without communicating to other countries will no doubt a rookie mistake\nWhy they did and arresting the prime minister of Lebanon and bringing them back a Saudi Arabia no doubt was a rookie mistake\nAnd in the order of this which it would appear that he may have done certainly this goes beyond rookie mistake\nAnd goes into the area of being absolutely ruthless we know of what he did at the Ritz Carlton where I detained\nOpposition folks shut them down torture some of them and so I think we just need to understand that hood as

when he's talking about the biggest to this country but I certainly my thoughts on what you have a good don't get much market started crying [noise]\n\n\n... for the mayor of London and peaceful policies celebrities that are ... everyone attending to contact their employees to say they won't be Kevin if about ... percent [noise] some and\nJoins with some of the sounds from the streets of London that political correspondent Rob Watson was at the march give us a sense of of the day role but if you can\nWell it was absolutely massive massive massive crowd I think much larger than expected on good morning to enroll someone die but you know what I wanted to do I should say uh for the listeners everybody else is just to Chuck Chuck massive grenade and at the beginning of our conversation\nYou go to sort of sense of some of the question that I Do think that Britain as in the middle of a real crisis because what you've had that as evidence of the extraordinary passion and division the sort of toys in the ... ... ... in to to operate Britain is a divide that there is\nThat you've also got a governing conservative policy that's just including I have a ... you have a main opposition Labour Party that's not seen as a credible governments\nYou've got businesses now profoundly worried about what Brexit light may ... says of a breakdown in the talks between the u._k. and that you are I think uh uh getting high up so I'm Sorry to be so hostile legally made it really does seem to me\nThat we're in a way that we are really in a crisis it may not yet I feel like that's a lot of old people but you take that sort of\nYou know I guess I describe it as the sort of the poisoning division that Brexit districts into this country like nothing else I have seen in sociology is is a reporter ... as you say I'm really glad we had you on the sorry state universities\nWhen you look at opinion polls do you see any significant shift in public\nOpinion on this well you know I'm not a pollster but I guess what has happened is this a it's sort of settled down to the if you think about it to ... leave ... remain by almost ... percent yet the polls have settled into ...\nConsistently of about seven percent of people now saying that it was the wrong decision to vote to leave the European Union has to say that at all I think a lot of people in this month's yesterday but what I understand that's what I think that hasn't quite what has it been yet as some massive decisive\nA public shift against Brecht said I mean it's true that the opinion polls\nConsistently suggests that most people say that the government is amazing thing making the most old might seem asked that they are in a shambles as a social with of chaos\nBut I think what you clearly haven't had an interesting set to hit ... anything there's no evidence to the people who voted leave half on ... uh uh we've made a horrible mistake\nI Will look it up a Rosenman thoughts on that maybe or anything else you wish you observed before I get back to rub\nMy degree at that ... that as well and rice and the assets and oversee the extraordinary passionate and it it it was a jelly for pay to pay and it was perfect have but you come away rethinking lever victory but the truth of the tree belief has on the ice sheet compassion\nAnd yet I mean did you come across anybody who had voted leave who's now change their mind sufficiently passionately to do something like well I\nDidn't even think they do exist but I Can't stand him as that they thought that that many of them in the minds of heights and that but then again it's the Al Smith challenge and there was somebody trying to direct people getting together and a different way to the south but not that difficult to change people's\nMinds isn't that right it's not and I thought well that'd be a problem as your daddy\nLook I think the the my worry is that the sort of simplistic tools that we have to decide on on these massive questions you know a referendum that simply involves a yes or no or even an opinion poll that says do you regret the division isn't going to give us the sort of new ones and it was a fascinating piece of research commissioned by kings College London recently which\nTested various options and ask people to you know with all the nuances of the relationship with Europe to ask people to rank them and make trade offs\nAnd what you get to the single largest group of ... in Britain want her relationship with Europe that resembles something like the European economic association ... now unfortunately none of that new one seems to have crept into public debate led learn policymaking and so I went back to a very divisive simplistic yes no\nType model um when it comes to the public posturing and many of our political leaders and\nAnd I think most people are having up to the fact that that's not how where they are and um they want to much more sophisticated I'm discussion\nA robe us for that thoughts um what what are your thoughts as a result of hearing them\nNo I agree and has a sort of changed my view that we are in an absolute whole I mean that's that's a snow two ways about says I mean it is that is that sort of\nToxic combination of having all ready votes as all the way people just divided in such a powerful light and the politicians I mean the key thing here is that there is no consensus amongst British politicians to six hundred and fifty employees you said\nTo stay in aside from within that's another option isn't it\nIs another option and I do have a few friends although in a decreasing number who are still principal number Trump present are in the Republican Party fighting for their\nBut I saw that early on that it was a losing battle after Donald Trump won the presidency\nPersonal one if I may what she'd like to leave a political party that you've been a puddle for so long I mean how loony does that become one it's a difficult\nProcess no question about it I mean the falling out with friends or having to reorient myself in the world I mean I was a member not just the way political party but about political tribe and that's really what what the political parties are in America it's startling to see that people change religions more often than they change political parties\nDo you consider yourself now to be a a new party personal view swung as far as now saying you'd prefer to vote Democrat\nI'm not affiliated with any party at the moment but I Am saying that everybody should vote democratic in November because I think it is imperative to have a check and balance on Donald Trump but I think there is a real issue going forward for twenty twenty\nWhat will the Democratic party stand for I I for one would love to see the Democratic party moved to the center and capture the allegiance of a lot of independent voters like me and former Republicans like me\nAnd what would moving to the center mean in practical terms in policy terms and I'm thinking particularly in foreign policy terms which we haven't talked about yet but I Know it's an area of particular interest of your calls at what would the send to ground meat in foreign policy terms for you\nAnd foreign policy I think it would mean reaffirming our alliances stopped trashing NATO stopped trashing the you stop complaining about American troop deployments\nAnd just one final point about the Republican Party going perhaps a little further back in time than just since Donald Trump became president because that's what you looked into in your book and I'm assuming that you have shifted politically not just\nBecause of Donald Trump what he stands for but what do you do to be fair to say that it's because of some of the things that you have\nFound out about the Republican Party and its recent past as a result of delving into it\nThat's absolutely true I ... in the corrosion of conservatism I chronicle my awakening to the Republican Party and the conservative movements dark side which was there all along but I was blind to tour the country because I was part of the tribe and now looking back at the history with with a clear eyed assessment I realized\nOh my goodness the Republican Party has been a catering to racism or for a long time it has become increasingly marred by by ignorance by an assault on science by a a pandering to to prejudice\nAll these ah critiques that liberal so I've been making all along that I thought were just slurs on the good name of the Republican Party the election of Donald Trump made me realize wait a second this is accurate this is true\nMax Boot to as you head has now left the right I'm telling you what do you make of that\nWell look I think the heat the current heroes of Donald Trump does make me nostalgic for a time when conservatism meant something there was an ideology behind the politics is of particular tribe\nAnd what worries me is that not only has that are sort of distinct lack of any coherent ideology behind what say for example the policy actions of a Donald Trump at the dismantling of the very institutions that have supported supposed to sort of um uh keep democracy propped up ... and that's deeply worrying\nBut the Max Boot argument without ... disparaging seemed to be to go back to something that's been tried before and the voters have rejected\nWell voters are rejecting all sorts of institutions and I think that's where the power of populists like Trump or live in the sense that they say look you're frustrated with the lack of you know how how this institution isn't working that come on board but what they now get is a is a sort of lottery of of\nOf of Twitter generated policymaking rather than something that's actually coherent need based on on ideology\nRunning things I find fascinating because you know and the u._k. we might be looking and some people had to actually come paste and I went back to that she has happened when we might be looking at a red lining about political party but\nOne thing that is not when you know Janice that cake that he's quite how tribal people have mended the young particularly over the unpaid and in that sense that\nThe case you do fail ... crowd I mean that's not what one thing's really it was so interesting how ... leaving friends but you're also leaving something needed invested much time and and but I Do think there's something really sets that people are willing to look at the accidents and I'm over in right now\nAnd say I would change my position and I and I have another is that that I think where we can be very cruel steeply change their mind and I think actually it's something we need a lot more generally and I'll tell us that\nAre my guests today Danny ... tend to Roger ... when

in recent decades has been about creating a rules based international order and\nOne of the things that I Am so very clearly at the United nations just a few weeks ago was that never has that system

regard\nWe're entering a very dark and dangerous erode human his\nBut if a signatory is violating an agreement isn't it an incumbent on you ultimately as the other signatory to say well if you don't

G was not going to come out to update comes to let that um something had happened to him\nI was worried not because he will be achieved in the ... that was something that unexpected and and I think we'll think which will be possible for my imagination all the confidence of international relations\nBecause you were in conversation and that is deep conversation with one another month ago talking about the possibility all sold out in the gym making some kidnapping or arresting people abroad when it comes to turkey she said it almost impossible to do it you know in Turkey because\nMinnesota is paying much much attention much significance relationship with turkey because they have very good traditions and they don't want to put it in two or three he were feeding himself safe for even into cheat\nHis key and was not because he didn't care about these fish was to be kidnapped or can be arrested them being sent to so that yeah\nSo what do you think happened to your mouth shut the inside the Saudi consulate\nPicture is almost complete so as soon as he enters the coast so they know the short time he has been kicked I think the ... the explanations that's made by Saudi Government that he was a fight or something like is impossible of course on convincing claim because\nFifteen guys it wasn't that much because she fights you has been lynched I think they came intending to kill him and ... his body and they are not that much because I was to think about some deep days\nFor example the just waiting for him outside and if something is wrong track them showed him for me or inform somebody as\nTech he promised to reveal every detail about the killing of your mouth shut gee\nWhat does it mean by that is it going to make the audio and video evidence of his killing which is said to exist as he can make that more generally available make it available perhaps to foreign governments\nI think turkey has many many of them because the prosecutor or the intelligence or the security forces are from the beginning collecting old evidence is old news is old data\nAnd all they are under what ration and there are studies and they are being analyzed out of the ... they'll come of where the where the the pay is about what happened nothing will be kept a secret\nSo turkey is determined to continue challenging the Saudi version of the death of Jamal ... G your determined to do that even though there might be diplomatic consequences for turkey\nFor the people on the ... edition doesn't contain to hide the crimes then the criminal issue here and this cannot be kept secret that cannot be hiding in terms of justice should not be in those\nCould I just dropped that because all you tending towards now accusing the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman a man of all during the mud or rub Jamal ...\nActually at this stage ... nobody you cannot because anybody because Steve the investigation results officially the hasn't come yet\nThat was ... chief advisor to the Turkish president Richard ... to one and a close friend of ... to ... G and just on that last point roast them in the close friend to the ... degree I Wonder whether the personal side of the story has been lost as people have rushed to talk about the geopolitics\nUh yes I think that that that is true I Am one of the thing that I Am raising less bad mouth shut and he was putting out in the run up to his death he was receiving a crazy amount as a piece on line as friends that she talked about that some as well\nUm and you know he's way camp every morning to ... and stuff and it was really really weighing on him as as you might imagine it would be very nation in training\nAnd say well the he knew he was in\nUm uh you know in in in ... I'm ... something to kind of dying from being of actual threat obviously to being a real threat is very different thing but I think we have we have forgotten ... says while in less I mean I I kept thinking that I'm watching it was a horrific thing to be way sang\nAmid reports of self home and suicides\nSome say that might be one of the reasons why the government has raised the possibility of allowing the asylum seekers to settle in New Zealand with one condition they have to agree never\nSet foot in Australia in their lives so is that possible we'll plausible will or on the line to discuss it to to get that we've done in Rhode Island\nJulian ... law professor at University of Melbourne and former president of the Australian human rights commission Julian welcome to the program thank you very much and the ... government who's an MP in New Zealand\nOr he was an asylum seeker as a child and then became the first refugee elected to New Zealand parliament a bill reads welcome\nThank you good to have you on the program I'm can we start I'm dealing with the practicalities of the ... is it possible to do as I just described\n[noise] well um it's probably for practical purposes going to be very difficult to its whole so though as we all know with\nDigital computers it's possible now to maintain surveillance as a people and and possibly to prevent someone ever returning\nA badge and that it's going to be a difficult thing to achieve thoughts about possible\nBut they have to see the point that needs to be understood is that this proposed ban uh it would actually have an effect ... widely than those\nA hundred and fifty on a on the road amount is uh that could affect all those who have arrived in Australia since twenty Thirteen as so cold ... unauthorized maritime arrivals I'm so they we now have\nPerhaps a wicked problem of trying to decide whether the government should how are they allowed to hold the house to the that the children as hostage and they found it costs a to this proposal for a band that would affect a hundreds of possibly thousands of other people\nI it's a very difficult to I mean there is free movement is in between New Zealand Australia\nWill that it that it's precisely that pressure economic relations agreement that allows treatments that\nThat has created and away the problem because if an asylum seeker ... a refugee where to be settled in another country they would all Rick lot harmful but these are noted come back to Australia which would be a mechanism ... at one whatnot safe for blocking their return if that's what the government wants to do\nThat with New Zealand there is a writes\nA of ... to ah to to free movement into Australia said that is that is a pop the reason why this ban is seen as a poll because they start in the government does not want anybody who's being removed from Madison to have to have the opportunity to settle a straight it it's gotten the policy from the very long\nTime so ... got them and what does that therefore mean the New Zealand government would have to do in order to make this work\n[noise] yeah well this was of course there's also was ... years ago and and the Fisher or are they in all sorry um and at that point a stray was asking that New Zealand and full of less than hot so low that that um would eventually create um and there was opposition to it from the Green Party which was my policy as well\nIt would create this kind of state can tear residency or citizenship within ...\nUm which was really concerning and now it's slipped site that of course that's sort of going to the terrible Lauren Australia potentially\nUm but uh but of course there is this a issue and I I have been really close contact with the ... since the software was made to understand what was happening I visit but um you know it's the broad base\nUm approach that those ... low tax which doesn't just affect the uh United says the anti except that New Zealand world have but actually you know it kind of unpaid the rights of ah every assignments they ... or a refugee that's come through that kind of the arrival pass 'em\nBecause the ... of course for some reason has decided to differentiate between classes of [laughter] of mind them sick as a depending on how they arrive at one side joined us and the opposition but but at at at least doesn't affect us and you say ... sorry the office stands want them\nYou know I was gonna say 'cause I just wanted to clarify that before I bring down the road rules have been ... on the broad issue the New Zealand also that you referred to that goes back some time in the past you think that's a good idea that that is a positive from New Zealand point of view\nYes I Do you also was night by a previous a prime minister that John K and it was when you don't like the immediate late by a out prime minister ... when she took office\nSo that that offers um one that stands on and of course the practicalities the vet become complex F F at as accepted um because of course there are the children and it's Ninety our children um at at last count that I had access to and of course I've got family so it made\nIt there there's a lot more people than one fifth of all of that has like a couch all the while\nI'm right so it was from a studio here then I'll come back to you both ... and your mind\nLook I Know that the you know over the last few decades and bring points at which this tension in this free movement of agreement I remember you know straight in complaining about using this coming I'm living on the old

New Zealand is leaving to go to start he said well no because he you know every time and he's doing leads to go to Australia\nThe IQ of bugs countries goes up and despite all of that tension never was this principle of free movement um ever really under theories threatening in yet here is an example of how\nTo work something desperate to politicians become when it comes to immigration and asylum in a few hundred people and the future I'm a ... he's putting it\nFundamental principle of free moving between these two come back in the news because somebody who grew up in Australia as a refugee on this is one of the things I wanted off doing about you know I my parents um found in stride your lifetime and I grew up in in a period in which started was a very welcoming nation and\nNo one or two off duty and where where is public sentiment these days in terms of these issues\n... well it's it's an interesting question the end to end up particularly interesting time at which dry skits because ah last night Australian time we saw in ... I Believe an unprecedented um shift in political or support from the government\nA swing all around twenty percent to in this case and independent\nBut in the context of that ... and\nThey was the suggestion put out that the Australian government bought finally except they a generous offer by museum which has been on the table for some some years and the data one irony is that had Australia accepted that office when it was his made we would have cleared out all the families and children on the roof\nOr they're still about twelve hundred people on those two the two items\nUm so I talk to your question they\nTo the extent that the bite action is an indication and I think it is up to a point there is now a a a real public interest in resolving this problem that\nWhile arguably a the the public could accept that people will be sent to Madison ... full of processing with a view to finding some form of ... settlement within a year or two\nThat four five six years later a way ready saying people in a desperate circumstances as you said with many suicides and threatens threats of suicides but also\nA crisis in mental illness so I think that there is a shift\nA but we have to be very careful in in in ... in taking the weight with 'em by the action result as too strong an indication of his shift because it was very much in the context of a desperate government trying to to win over relatively liberal minded\nLike adults are labor not necessarily going to do anything different\nYou know well that is that he does need to be understood that labor introduced a mandatory ... detention that unique provision globally and has since insisted on both know robot wanna now Murray a nervous too so\nWe have to be very careful I think that the Labour Party will be more humane and they probably will try to get the children off the island with their parents about nothing is sitting in this highly volatile political garbage in Australia Rosemont\nCan I ask about the feeling in New Zealand in the ass chi chi refugees and migrants because\nI mean obviously in Europe and unfortunately we have suffered this was an increase of anti refugee and an anti immigrant rhetoric what'd you Nancy she'd like in New Zealand to these people and their company is a small number of people\nYeah New Zealand to I'm sort of often identifies itself in opposition to Australia [laughter]\nAs you know we have sort of Canada us relationships that I'm so serious suddenly some of the ... you know the war on terror ah and um and that kind of populist movement that we've seen with you know the rights of President Trump\nAnd have differently tend to trace it here and you can kind of see that\nI'm On online forums and and and and the rise of a certain type of populist politics here um that depend on on rice and and sort of on a sketch gutting of migrants so things like we're having a housing crisis for example in ...\nCertainly have seen the ads and it's sad to say but in tens of that kind of fear um that kind of intense fear and and and um panic that we see in Australia and sometimes\nProfessor Steven ...

mean should be lovely old lady has been playing on the streets and she was a little girl you know and she tells me the name of the song tells me the authors of the most famous interpretations\nAnd we just have this conversation about music it was really magical in a way because\nYou know in the world that is so visual used every visual tool I could find to try to find information and then the only place that could actually find information was the memory of a wonderful blind woman\nOn the street and she basically added so much magic to his story for me personally\nNow do you want to hear more my ex pave in Africa might sound like a major and expensive infrastructure project but not so says ... who is senior develop a manager for Africa at the Internet society\nIt sounds ground when they say intimate exchange point but it's actually just a normal traditional layer to switch the speech that you probably finding any office\nOr a data center is pretty much what it is but it's building one in a lot more about social engineering than the technical side of it because\nWhat you're doing is bringing operate as who are inherently competitor housing market and asking them pay into connect and exchanged traffic among just fails for the benefits of you your network on your customers you both lean\nAnd making them see that Russia now take some time and then once they actually do understand that they become a chunk of it all\nRight so we're not talking about digging up lots of streets and laying in ... you know this is like the ... my fix as simple as is often the way the technical but it's relatively easy but it's bringing people together and that's what's going on with the Internet so I'd say one of your partners for instance if Facebook say he's getting invoked joins ...\nA lot of the ... a lot of capacity building a part of the reason why these exchange plans have know meanness damaged his because um\nMost of the network or protests and the state cold as all their community involved in providing networks ... access services are not aware\nAnd the other thing we're going to do with this project he's also help those that are already existing\nTo be able to grow and kill to be able to me that increasing demand we've seen some of the ones that have come up into oppression and the last twenty four months that is six months of hot significant growth in the amount of traffic\nAnd so they need new equipment because what they started with was basic as he needed and then the growth hasn't been a lot more uh exponential than anticipated at the beginning and so they need the equipment new technologies to help them support the growing the mountains\nAnd Facebook has all kinds of initiatives to increase isn't the access in\nDeveloping countries in some of the poorer parts of the world including is while the controversial free basic site there where you know you were given free broadband access but in return Facebook has a lot of control over which services people are able to access\nI I just wondered if Facebook the right partner for approach it like this well\nUm yes I'm double see that looking at the whole picture that you know the Internet is for everyone and they they object TV I used to actually ... exchange points things to in fact uh the quality of access at low cost access basically ... and he uses\nSo our mission and out of Facebook it's quite aligned with respect to try to bring access to everyone\nAnd so um I think in in this particular case we are very much aligned\nAnd what about then and finally uh how many uh BBC World service listeners across Africa especially in rural areas he doesn't have Grayson snacks as well does this really means that ... ... how soon might make a difference if a tool\nSoon enough if you look at how the Internet is designed eight and that takes change points that sort of like and I would say a facility that helps make the Internet tickle system crew\nSo uh you know it's sort of like that missing ingredient that makes everything went well so when you have any time that exchange fluent in means that you cannot tracked a continent Saudis provide us you cannot shocked a creation of local content\nWill kind of ... too many Saudis access provided us to come and connect because\nIt was the cost of them having access to contact that teams as won't\nAnd with enough a short time at the market itself grows\nAnd that means that the Saudis provide as well previously paying a lot of money to kind of a local content through expensive international liens can out of lord the local traffic onto these uh exchange points and the savings that they a crew from these offload evolve\nLocal Chafee ... ah from international expense evenings goes into building that last mile a which basically helps bring access to people who are far from the Aspen center\nSo that summit shaky more on gay and it's interesting that build something that he isn't cooling fed digging up the streets in some huge infrastructure projects the actually on a ... logical basis these acts pays these exchange points there isn't it pretty straightforward bits of ... by the end of it\nI mean that they ... that sophisticated themselves but you know what you're actually doing is just changing the connections ... network so they don't have to use the the long distance yeah find the base and international networks that that do lack\nA Jew cost a lot of money and and it's it is a really important initiative figure was interesting that you mentioned Facebook's free basics because this is such a different same that they do get holders to be supported\nThat it takes us back to the days of the ... you know when you reach that started it was about rich in connection of networks that made the whole thing possible\nAnd having moved over the last twenty Thirty years to go to where they're all major providers you tend to be interconnected themselves in a much more limited way\nI think the way forward particularly for African countries he's to return to these core principles to build that will which allows a dream today after the exchange local traffic and also chip to catch things likely to make it more available which will improve the quality of service to every one as well as as we heard that\nLiberate some of the funds to allow them to do the really hounded which does involve either

and and how that can be affected\nYeah sorry man huge unintended consequences or an antibody responses to pay to some of the spies assaults turn and threats to democracy from some of the innovations that were saying like let's say are now taking them all posted direction you've outlined some of the problems I mean some of the most puzzling but what about some of the solutions great

I introduce and piece by piece you make something that and then you explain hey just made a power last second\nAnd this is what it is and this is how it differs from as serious portion me this is what has to do with the way that we asked\nAll of my projects twenty project in the back and all of my projects were not chosen by me actually in fact I have an advisory board at two hundred girls between the age of seven on fourteen\nAnd I would email them every month with a whole bunch of different ideas and then they would vote on the projects that they wanted to see me make and I would make them so

hope to demystify the technology that they're going to be using every day and also to bring a sense of playfulness into their lives\nAnd something I've really tried to do in the back is to show them

looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAnd asking whether they will sound all not tend to look at them one by one and what we know that financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into was way so they build\nModels not where one dumbing down notes down enough of them now they build models actually with that if that wasn't bad [noise]\nWatch these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest rates

that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed would\nBounce back and most effect others but why would prevailing models assume that it crushed couldn't happen when economists note that economic crushes occurred was disturbing regularity\nPolitics that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous list because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great moderation and what that meant was the boom in the past didn't seem to be with us so we this is rolling along in a chair for way down the river a reasonable state and things are going OK\nPoliticians believe this to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue catch on sort of big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven\n[noise] we will not return to the old boom and bust [noise]\nEconomists so happy to blame the models

having a helpful obsession with perfect market ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes\nIncredibly these high priests

willing\nBouncer the former chief economist at one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were

not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either\nBut my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the right match once that disease has been diagnosed\nBut much of the fashionable economics of the Iraq has absolutely nothing to say about how to handle the crisis\nIt to go far too long to diagnose a disease and responses appropriately it was a school of economics that actually did that I Would add to the crisis\nSpecial occasion economics and a number of people made that point but then people recommended fiscal stimulus in the face of the recession they weren't using frontier economics or the guy that gets stolen graduate schools\nThey are using stuff that is vaguely remembered from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the searches that rather better than the economy of the eighties nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy whose students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in clubs ... there was seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crashing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions of the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them\nBrought home to many out of touch the profession has become Wendy colon is most of widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books must stumped subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash things as\nBasic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're\nAddressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way that curriculum excess taught in universities around the world and has not changed\nIt has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms\nRemember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend\nIf they give bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about and so I have to put my own conduct their I chose the core charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cool who to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's models allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\n\nHad massive Marty's economics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond even criminal behavior by buying cars that can freshman financial stability\nWe need a much more diverse group of\nResearchers in economics and teaches and mental\nMore diversity ... will shift the balance of the topics that are chosen for research it will give us much more talent to make it very plain and I think there's every reason to think that the subject will become even more vibrant even more\nPromising as a way of taxing the really big problems that we face\n\nSince the financial crisis that's been a healthy soul searching in economics the growing number of people in organizations have been pointing out the obvious froze and developing alternative views to better understand and improve the way the economy's work\nHas actually had an impact with masters\nCountry must so says if there's some evidence that it's not just lip service that change really is taking place\nWe had the global successive somebody like to pick a table with his inequality critique\nWe've had you know governments looking into different ways of measuring GDP we've had the big institution that's probably the biggest change like the IMF at the end of the day if you look at what they used to say before the crash in what they say now\nIt's it's very very different take the in the city that recommendations or recipes for how to\nCreate more jobs in the economy in the in the nineties it was all about deregulating and there was that there in Texas and if it's a bad set of making the labor market more flexible and and I sat and white and now we feed them now it's the talk about the importance of\nUnions and the importance of having relatively high wages send it it's ... it really has\nChanged I definitely think that the consequences of the crisis end of the discussions that we've had in the last ten yes\nHaving worked at the obesity the organization for economic cooperation and development I can vouch for this progress which is also reflected in the IMF work on inequality and it's and the bank of England's welcome climate change\nI've seen firsthand how much economics has changed since two thousand image new perspectives different ways of teaching and far more of a move towards understanding how crushes come about\nThe good news is that there's been some progress the bad news is that this was not it filtered through what he's done in the financial sector will impact on policy may cause\nI Believe that the best way to make sure those in power to hold their ideas about economics is for us all to get involved\nThere's a saying economics is too important to be left to the economists if we were all more confident the economics of Metra about daily bread wrong and something belonging to men in suits we will be better able to smell Iraq when something's too good to be true such as being offered a mortgage when we can't afford to pay its\nBut many people think of economics as very complex and the road the remote subject how can we overcome that and encourage people to get stuck in to improve our economic literacy\nJust like the statistics with politics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn it means we can better understand the world around us and we'll be better informed and more able to speak out about big national decisions such as regarding migration and trade\nWhen do you call them as citizens across the whole range of jobs especially journalists me to take more interested in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history and a better understanding of how different countries operate\nIs going to provide much broader basis of understanding so that when something new time's up like the threat of trade was then the kind of resonance the idea that somehow that they had been tried before that they hadn't had serious economic consequences in the Nineteen thirties\nThat can have a resonance with people with a broader public\n[noise]\nMy hope is that grace economic literacy will make our government's more accountable for the economic decisions they take
