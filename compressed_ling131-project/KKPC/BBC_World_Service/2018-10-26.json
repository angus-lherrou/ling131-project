Sunday these would be reversed\nSuggested to quite different views than a giant ... an hour as you'd expect well do you think his appeal is\nWell here's the deal is that she was the quintessential onto this tablet shipments candidate of course 'cause first target is that the tea but his main target is the political system\nAs we knew it so ... ... each of the political system all parties included\nAre so low in the historical low point in Brazil that someone that appeals to the prevailing on the establishment sentiment in the Brazilian society with a credible credentials because although he has been in politics for a long time for Thirty years\nHe's has always been an outsider never in the mainstream and uh what was a witness in the past has become clearly is Trent\nModel they'll tell you what would you see is is he being spent his appeal\nI think he had his timing has been excellent he was quietly in Congress for twenty eight years and now he has made this move he tapped into the disc content the frustration of voters the corruption the poor state services the economic recession the job losses\nHe manages to present this blend of social conservatism but also mixes with the economic liberal listen in his particular fake proposals so he presents these proposals that perhaps I'll bet can reassure investors\nCapital markets both international and domestic have been very ... listening to what type of he said and what type of that's been going on the simplistic solutions sometimes present it may be exactly what people feel is will the would like to hear at this moment\nAnd he is very good at talking he doesn't say much while he talks but that's the point sometimes and I think that is really life at the heart of his success tapping into the mood\nSo let's think about the background to all of this you mentioned the timing mother talks to just give us a sense of the states of Brazil's economy\nTo the state of the economy is just ... imaging out to a recession unprecedented two year recession alone side this recession job unemployment has\nReally rocketed up from about six percent before the recession started in twenty uh fourteen uh all the way up to about twelve touching percent in recent years alone side the recession the fiscal management the poor fiscal management of the previous government to be the governments have been exposed\nBrazil's public debt is Seventy seven percent of GDP some six point two percent of that goes just to interest payments the budget is is in a situation where primaries surpluses ... to the boom years if you're like a friend of president Lula have absolutely disappeared\nSo then they got enough and living beyond its means Randy well beyond its means and with ... asset to meet\nTo well I should say the current government has made ... efforts to reform but it is a very fruit a weakened government I'd of very divided Congress such if I Know you'll you'll agreeing I think in the background\nI entirely and just like to it's a two or three comments one is that it's been the longest recession ever registered in Brazil in history\nAnd the recovery is the slowest ever registered in the present in history\nSo it's hard to imagine from outside the levels social frustration and Brazil\nEspecially when you consider that prior to that\nThere has been a lot of upward social ability and Brazil from two thousand and three until two thousand and ten so the emergence of new so called new middle class in this so called middle class has been ... by the recession\nNo wonder that this bogus residents decides who who had voted for the tea in the past\nIs now voting massively for ...\nDays the meteor victims ... to the change in global economics China perhaps demanding the commodities and so on rather than just an economic mismanagement\n... we are witnessing in Brazil it's a combination of factors we have witnessed a growth and law inclined mentioned Brazil between two thousand and three eyes to Johnson and fourteen or ... thousand unfortunately all words of the criticisms are still ... economic policy that even people\nExcited they agree that there are two measures that she lied during her second third or wrong but beyond that we had a ... year political instability and Brazil has had a direct ... bought in our economy\nNot to college divinity though comes out of the corruption scandals and ... that has flowed from them or doesn't ... he has to take responsibility for that and actually look to that thought the hops ... the the fact that it's struggling to win votes and it's an action that daddy I guess ...\nYes with regards to that first criticism against uh the austerity measures we agree that that they were wrong but in addition to that we have to remember the right\nAt the beginning of this second term up too much government Congress has approved what we call about a bomb bus which our budget bills ... negatively in Brazil and budget\nAnd these wasn't like by the president of the lower house queen raising jail right now and also true my support from Brazil and opposition is the old politics\nAs worse it is better for\nUs because we can't change the game and has being damaging for the present anymore\nI'm On a ... that's the problem you see right there they never recognize any mistake that they have done for all those years you know it was very easy round has a lot of great it was like why Mary easy to have a budget surplus when commodity boom and\nThe first term of a Lula was really I I was very happy with his performance I Would have voted for a little bit that I don't I'm hearing you asked for a long time but if I were\nIn Brazil I Would have voted for a little in the first black out\nThat he increased welfare benefits and introduced a minimum wage\nYeah and it was the right thing to do but after the subprime crisis you start seeing a lot of counter cyclical policies that were not sustainable in the long run\nAnd by the time that a human hair lacked you see a reverse off many of the policy that the first term of ... that had pursued you start seeing a much more intervention used economy\nAnd when you look at the ... program for these election they just talking about increasing resources for areas like education health which you are very important but what we will\nTalk about that and a bit ... in a bit more details of the moment but I just want to think about the the backdrop to this election you have so president knew that the ... the president who is embroiled in corruption finds himself in prison his successor Jill ... who was impeached\nSuggest us do those are two factors the economy corruption the face of these two leaders that perhaps as as a fact to this election enormously but what about the other two things that are getting on the top of that crime and the conduct of this election crime is enormous feature present in life and Brazilian concerns\nFor the for addressing this topic and I took a step back and with all due respect to ... I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others it's not working any longer to the to the\nFirst one to scandal when the cyclical a corruption scheme was discovered the the PTA react to this shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if the war parts of a conspiracy against the tea\nThen when a before that where the economy started going down they said that they shifted to blame to the external environment so a yearly this just this rhetoric is not working any longer just looked at the polls and people were not mind that story and they won't\nLet me let me throw food then let's talk about how crime and they will talk about how these elections been conducted holidays affecting how Brazilians think about which way tonight\nCrime has become endemic in Brazil the reach of homicides in Brazil a has reached\nRecord levels in the last two years and now we have three homicides for one hundred thousand inhabitants what puts Brazil among the most violent\nHas close ties to the country's current military leadership Brazil lived on ... ministry dictatorship for more than two decades\nIt came to an end owning in Nineteen eighty five\n... ... what do you think uh both in our government would look like would it have a minute terrific aspect\nCertainly he has had many military advisors or his vice presidential candidate is a ... a recently retired military general but it's worth remembering that he in fact approached sucking traditional politicians to join his ticket and they were refused so\nThe military was certainly have more influence and government he's likely to appoint ministers who are retired military men\nBut the military in the sense of ... currently operating armed forces I think at this point the U.S to trying to not get drawn into let's say this new adventure pure warmed\nUp Monica who to do think it's less sacrificing perhaps some of Brazil's democratic credentials if that ... some security by moving closer to them in a tree\nThe fact that he is a form of military that in itself\nFor many people raise flags but you know I think that in the military can be very helpful in many areas of ... of you need we need stronger\nThe fans saw in the in our borders right I Would hope that the fight against drug trafficking will take place on the borders and not in the middle of the cities\nBut it's that Britain mills is that Brazil's biggest problem and what is it is because a lot of the weapons we we're getting a lot of the trade of weapons is just huge and and they will narrative tree or is that a role for the police\nOr the borders for the military and I've heard from people from five to campaign that they also want to use the military for infrastructure projects in the story of the country which the military has expertise right I'm moderate\nDoping is that is that usual to have the minute she on your boat is would it be welcome do you think in any country to have the minute tree ... involved in in in the in the area\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presence in the Amazon answer to that extent the sort of\nNationalist view of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the border\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society I think the more important distinction however about the role of the military he's on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude to where it's growth and development\nThe Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most to boost Brazil's development and I think Shia international markets have got to slightly I think or do\nThey think that both scenario would be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet and then I don't see how they can expect to realize the sort of economic liberal version but his economic advisor ... stokes about\n... jak there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is if you read their program for governor ... the one number one thing that they keep heating on it just didn't need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many interviews acknowledged that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of this trend is one of the country in the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption ... associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHe's government is clearly one\nThat the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending he's already has a plan to reduce the number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team they have a very clear record of being very pro Marquette and probably even really forums\nOr his already Monica nothing is very clear about what you\nJust read from from from well I'm On the new governor\nFor eight years I don't know how this thing's worsen realize this coalition has been put together hastily\nRight and you have different groups that do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues\nAnd I think a doctor mark group is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic mind side of the military and the liberal team which has been gathering around the economist in a previously announced\nFinance minister Paolo get the let's see how this story on the program an old programs are deliberately vague\nFor us I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called headquarters of his campaign what we have to judge if they if you read the two programs right and I think there is a stark contrast between this ... of the comic project\nThat's what we go for on the other hand I understand what you're saying that the ... once you are in power that is really that you put them through the past what are they are going to be faithful I understand that but clearly that's how the business community in Brazil believes as well and you see\nIn ... just how the stock market in dollar behaves when he became a including his lead and then you end up homeless\nRemains it remains to be seen markets are my authored by nature\nNow you know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving\n... you know today if I can bring you add it as there is a renewed\nAbout which makes it difficult to the PC well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil but ... days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the states in that lived\n[noise] we have two different very different projects with these two very different approach in one side we have a few of those so narrow himself as a liberal surrounded by ministry a nationalist on the other side it has a dodge who has a\nKind of a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage or to have a presence [noise] so what we have ever is is is lawless state versus states that will intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people have in jobs\nMore people would spend money and ... that there is in an economy\nProblem is that they don't start they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than the world bank and that they compete with the banking system rotting front that that's why\nYou have to get the caffeine with I Know they get they get the ...\nWell established companies giving loans like very low interest rates\nMorning at around ... you said that uh both ... makes very clear comments actually not for example initially they talk about ... stokes about privatization of state owned enterprises and then of course both to narrow immediately boats in and say oh yeah yeah yeah privatized ... not\nMetro bras not generations or the left her Ross Perot says almost on the brink of going for privatization is not going to be hosted\nIt's all very conditioned maybe ... ... talk has been liberal but I feel the practice when not to be liberal it will be intervention okay because that's the way Brazil has developed let me just Brazil's development history\nLit hold on to those two quite distinct views of which way the economy may go I wanted to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talked about traditional family values very tough on

has to make what the cost more small typing in the end of the day\n... down the line he gets as well I think that there's a lot more people involved and tasting the food so a dish that we might change\nWill take good six months to get a she asked in the restaurant it's not like oh today ah we've got the whole close it could all does none of that not only is it just about the customers it's about getting it right every single time\nIt was very difficult with Indian food because you have to go to Berlin striped with the spices and the parents here you're introduced spices and the

do you think about that\nShe always organized the best party for me but the the pet thing like the worst case is that's only happened like every two years because her focus is at the restaurant\nFast will serve out ... fast in West things about being married to a chef and do you think can tell them when they agree\nWith very very tight and we it was a relief for me to be with somebody who was as focused on that would cause me incredible\nLifestyle now having done a lot of hard work\nWe do meet some incredible people and the one thing is possibly seeing him not have enough\nTime where they feel though I was really really really really how to make sure that he has so much time with him [noise] taken him to the restaurants and eking out on a day's time not so she can spend time with that and the ... so some things you know I don't know we'll just have to say\nNow I think the best thing if I'd been married for ... will say will be ...

that they are engaged in\nA but to say that they control those areas is I think a a very big exaggeration yes they can drive fear into people in those areas they can they can get ... they they will be able to kidnap and there'll be able to attack people but do they govern those areas I think that there is has to be a distinction between does\nWell ... if you're telling me is it off your student every inch of the country yes yeah is it\nPossible to man every inch of the country no do you know but no country does that but to be able to bring the ah the population centers the Afghan population central under control and provide them with security\nIs that effort that we are uh uh that we have that we've been working on and are now working well Lance or even for the areas where there is a there is in security so that I have the support of the people in New solutions to uh to bring stability to those areas and security for the people\nI I understand you own your own understand you're working on the challenges and the challenges are real just explained to me if you can because you all the president's national security advisor as all the last few months explained to me why\nAccording to the Pentagon inspector general the civilian death toll in Afghanistan\nHas reached a new record high in recent months the last year why is it that the trajectory is it in the wrong direction and the the most important function of any government that is protecting civilians your government cannot achieve\n... where we are under attack as the space for the insurgents grew smaller and they're not able to launch the kind of attacks they wanted to to take territory in two thousand fourteen after the international security forces the majority of the national security forces left\nAnd they tried to take territory and that has been there a strategic objective but they failed they could take it could not maintain so this the tactics waged two attacks in cities in populated areas to bring international pressure and of course pressure on the Afghan government\nUm uh that said we have been working at protecting politics or a population centers um you hear of the news of the extraordinary of attacks that happen but you don't hear of all the attacks that have been preventing\nThat we have been preventing our security institutions have been a improving their their service system to prevent them and prepare themselves for the changing tactics\nThat yet I haven't how will you tell the leader you got a little later by that I I'm\nSo sorry to interrupt ms might have been at it it is difficult with us the lay on the line with a whole you're telling me about the scale of the Taliban threat the more I get completely confused about what your own government is doing in response for example why is it\nThat you are failing to keep up the force levels that you promised to actually deliver security to the Afghan people\nAs I understand that your according to the Pentagon your force numbers both in the police and the armed forces on now at least ten percent below that expected strings and then the numbers appear to be dwindling and not only the numbers are dwindling the morale is most definitely dwindling as well\nWhen when we look at just numbers and I I think without the context\nIt obviously seems uh a very bad but we have been working on reforms in our institutions so some of those windows ... numbers what it seems like we're actually inflated in the past ... they were there were goals soldiers are that that have been reduced the number is because we put in systems in place\nTo tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news a space for them on a son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is that transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investment in the ... the has not gone to waste yeah that's way out of the war it's not an eighth it's not a ward of the way of brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a ... it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support or been helping in equipment and training our security is\nTo provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time is it might have so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particularly the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nHonestly ... you know the checks sold them electronically more restrictions on the board of what would that mean\nEven if we leave the the reason why we got in trouble [noise]\nCheck at the same system there is no\nWe don't know what's gonna happen whether we're going to offer a business just cuts on not just because it would be so hard to get across in yeah yeah ... are going to taxes are going to be top sort of stuff with the border asking\nReading from the down in front of a man from Romania they you know the whole evening portable we're going to be more has to be has to be with some very very easy like [noise]\nBut I'm driving alongside the border\nAll sides in the ... the u._k. the republic of Ireland and Europe they all agree that the border should stay open the problem is that just counted gray

that which is even more major for our company fifty out of her own place to live in Northern Ireland traveled across the border de ... sort of fear if these two well you could ... I was I think\nFor any of us in the ... last the last thing any of us want to see the reality is if you have any Cain of checkpoint on the border crossing is going to disrupt flow\nAnd when you the slowest inconvenience cost money\nOn the on the phone payoff I won't be in front of them\nHave family from\nLook at the moment is probably about thirty minutes to travel across sucking off from a party defensive and we all know one of it is actually the previous experience of\nAfrican left off the air ... every day I mean\nThe moment and you're saying so yeah okay [noise]\nSo he's a big question do you think we could\nSome of them get in on one of these red Skelton\nDaphne ... off of a big part of war you know ...\nThe other one is from the moment are holding off [laughter] what do you I mean they're going to tell me\nSo what's clear is not any change to the moon and wouldn't be a huge issue for a company like this\nEspecially when you consider that a court of ...\nTo me [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] ... really really illustrates the challenges to board a present so it's a it's a form that actually struggles ... fields here for the moment I'm In a note on and in the u._k. and the ah there's a little stream of hedge\nAnd on the other side I'm just pushing it now on the other side here is the Republican bought and didn't or\nThe former who runs this lunch is Henry McIlroy\nSo how difficult would it be to close this boat or do you think they're cutting Rico's no\nYeah you just like the whole thing by talking on a ... and ... but I had him on stage that clicking on TALK of all but I still talk to you want to know guard post here in ...\nOn the court and I told them situated\nSo when the ... the British troops were I guess I make a ...\nCouple of years or ... what are some some stumbles beef on every\nMeans suffered only getting so Britain UK crossing for the federal ... hat yeah becomes a person's right through into the into the European Community ... on a\nShort drive from the border you know ma brings me to market hill in Northern Ireland so I Wonder what things ... small independent trying to like this\nAre you worried the might be a hard border again without their programs bishop chasing\nA wave country far worse than not here we had five bombs at her door and businesses here over the years and I to be honest I think Theresa May has Ninety five percent of\nThe ... the other five of the shortest she comes right after I don't know what\nComes through very clearly from those interviews is how important it is for but treat everyone who lives works near the border that it stays open so why is on and divided\nOn why is this division still such a sensitive issue that is what my colleague ... ... Amanda focused and a freelance journalist from Belfast in Northern Ireland\nEarnings divided into two jurisdictions the republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. so governed by Britain within Northern Ireland are are sort\nOf three sets of people there are people who have the British identity people have an Irish should end today and then the group in the middle that have a mixture of those identities\nSo the union is that people with the British identity one term in part of the United kingdom whereas the other side won the whole light and fired and to be one\nNation and not to be governed by Britain so that's what the conflict came into it and not still a cultural war still a political war so the Nineteen Ninety eight Good Friday agreement to peace protest ... signed has given Northern Ireland uh degreed stability prior to that\nWas in decades of conflict ... murders and bombs and people were fair to the troubles which doesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would have been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day not fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go without any restriction we knew it was time to show documents that the idea no idea that you might go back to there being any sort of the it presents or a military presence or anything like that\nThe border as if deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of finance returning if there is a quota we established between the Irish republican or the night and it's a real threat\nI think that it is you know when people talk about I returned to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think about the hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups who gets to the Republicans and what are most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton is sad\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are carrying that work would become a target\nThan it's the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the police service here how serious concerns about bought a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view\nThat people in ... and not into it would actually like to see the ball to come back well [noise]\nEverybody says you know the political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion all say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that you know with an account be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade database that\nThe Northern Ireland wouldn't be excluded from that\nWhereas the majority of the parties have you back so it's sort of the best of both worlds speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've got her head and her hands because we're paying for this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement and it's not being accepted as\nHow much of the discussion topic is for people on the day to day basis in way you are in ... this is something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time\nIt's something that everybody's talking by day in day I\nWas ... that has done is put the issue of the constitutional possession\nHigh up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't pain in the past the peace they'd had sort of felt the constitutional position whereas now I with ... said people here are talking up Irish unity and away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is feeding the practice it will strengthen northern Ireland's union with Britain\nWhereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually have a ... when the British union aside if things are now starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances and certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every\nTV show every talk show every polling older by these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity\nWhere in the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between he and the u._k. but also

on a rule of law political prisoners and so on but you do come and discuss with me\nIt is also a second thing is power diplomacy by putting\nA essentially the message from Moscow is we're in charge we'd only even outside all all the Iranians to be around the table and a as we all know is the best of the spokesperson for within has already announced no back breakthrough to be expected\nMr Bruni

think uh the agenda is somewhat different depending on the participants for Idlewild essentially a major diplomacy and photo opportunity demonstrating that the east part of the solution as you said in the U.S\nFor letting me and put in this is power diplomacy has already\nA made an announcement through is a spokesperson on Monday I think it was saying don't expect any advance them but we are in

will hand out the bill when we come to reconstruction\nIt's more complicated if you look at the the positioning of of Mac and micro or they will inevitably be perceived as bowing to to putting\nThe

the U.S\nOr the U.S domain aides mid eternity the one side of the Syrian territory which is north and west and east side of the Euphrates River\nOr through to solve so special forces some French as well and uncles the allies the Syrian Kurdish forces\nUm but uh that is something that in the end will be the real problem for for ... because the uh overall objective is that the Assad regime should re conquer the entire territory upset and goes all the borders by the way it will also be the problem for\nFor turkey which has three military operations on going in in Syria but for the moment

uh he was in the newspaper says he was asked for his resignation by a a Larry Page one of the founders of Google um he could have been to be fired and and given nothing and said he was handed a Ninety million dollar a exit package\nSo shortly after this this a newspaper article appeared and I must be said with Mr Ruben has denied the allegations shortly\nIt appeared 'em out came this email from some chai goose chief executive or saying today's story in the New York times was difficult to read and then revealing that these forty eight people who've been terminated for sexual harassment and stressing that none of these people had received what do you call it an exit package\nAnd up for re pretty Rory Google says it some can get tougher in the future against inappropriate conduct by workers\nIt says it's going to great environments a workplace where you can feel safe to do your best work or where there are serious consequences for anyone who has inappropriately but there have been a number of cases are in particular they're being taken to court by a female engineer\nAlleging Harris meant it has been a growing issue not just to do but the number of other Silicon Valley companies\n[noise] ruining many things how technology correspondent Rory ... a big businesses are doing enough to grapple with this problem I'm Charlie ... to the u._k. lawyer who's handled a number of sexual harassment cases over the past Twenty years\nI think that he different to any other large organization within the u._k. and I think the real problem is that we haven't actually dealt with sexual harassment is an issue with an inside say there are a number of head or for women who do you feel that's been sexually harassed within the place that they've got to always come if they want any remedy what was the last I\nHad was included the effect on that career if they make a complaint\nAnd there's evidence and set any research that shows that they have a detrimental effect than any woman all non Korea if that's actually interested in the workplace and actually that they couldn't painted they investigated by the employer was well he's ultimately liable compensation for the kite\nSo there was too late investigating themselves tax rate settles with it as well if the woman against the thoughts of employment tribunal than they have quite an aggressive\nCross examination they might they may be representing themselves that much is it that we live in these claims unless they need to I lost that job\nAnd also they might be faced with a with a very experienced ... number of days about the instance that it could that's quite distressing that finally it will say it's a national settlement agreement that if we compromise needs planes in resettling gr effectively sided thing that\nWe never actually look at the systemic failures that actually go towards encouraging sexual harassment\nWhat price and therefore they continue to have I Know no systemic machine that ... that were fat defeat diversity attached to white rented that you will laugh or not dealing with the original issues other place\nBut this does seem quite decisive action by Google the the second such teensy near managers and more than ... employees have a sexual harassment allegations\nI think it's definitely a positive step for organizations just talk to type sexual harassment within the ... serious state\nBut it's probably just the tip of the iceberg sexual harassment says I say within within ... organizations is endemic and we are not dealing with it\nAnd the fact that fact number the visual system is that what he did with the static issues that you face for example an application itself because the coaches that went in size from yes you have to make complaints\nAnd in fact the other shows and the geology by far the geology where they will not say anything well they'll ever\nAbout being ... so the tip of the iceberg is good news but it's a white guy the publicity dating with sexual harassment and ... so\nHow do you create that environment was sexual harassment is not Tom a right to bear is that there is a general cultural view I think we have to stop\nBlaming individuals diverse attached to the life of systemic failures I mean I spent Twenty years for examining Matt mainly\nAnd the effects of that effective is to identify what individual as a sexual the laughter is no examination that any organization fighting is there anything that goes to that ... the best way to do crafts systems that are broken isolation review the change in sexual harassment will continue to ... where they will make paint\nCherry would that to the u._k. lawyer specializing in sexual harassment you're listening to world uptight from the BBC in London [noise]\n\nAbout Seventy as anti microbial drugs such as antibiotics of successfully treated patients with infections ... many infectious organisms have adapted to the drugs to kill them making them less effective maybe using misusing these drugs can make resistance develop even foster [noise]\nTake the United states for instance that these two million people each year also to become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics these twenty three thousand or die on you as a result of these infections but scientists say they've developed a new antibiotic could help in the fight against drug resistant\nBacteria with me and the student professor Graham co chair of the world Health Organization's antibiotics are working group I gave statistics that from the United states but this is a global problem\nYou know it's a global problem and we're seeing it throughout the wealth both in rich countries in poorer countries in terms of the challenge it poses\nA particularly in Southeast Asia and we have problems with the measuring resistance but we're seeing it in the u._k. as well and the real concern is that this might threaten routine health care that we take for granted in my ... my
