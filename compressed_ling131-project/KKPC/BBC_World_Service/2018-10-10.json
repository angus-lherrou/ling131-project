I'm Kathleen O'Connor from Northern Ireland originally my favorite chapter in the book is the one written from the German perspective and I would like to read more around this particular topic\nAnd my question is what was your favorite written source in your research from the German ... this\nIs this is at one point for him one of her life is a ... is in Germany is living in Germany she is she's still a British woman but she's she's a um we do see actually about ... to ... some like from from\nThat side of the jungle yes I did become obsessed with David Brown or rock\nI [laughter] I had to be held back from being excited whenever I can go Seventy but even as I started going [laughter] you know his mistress were too young to remember is said as a there's a lot of color film footage for example under film footage but no to color film pushes so I'd I'd say that um although that sounds\nLike a trivial way of getting into the gym and experience the world is actually does open up lots of things about\nAnd so it's it's all going into the book so it's not taking the limited space in my brain\n[laughter] ... oh\nSo she's ... in Pennsylvania or in the usa asks you this is talk can house I just find it for you as a right to to give your characters every ending from actually the wretched to happily ever also\nVery satisfying I think I can say I I'm I loved endings anyway I Love the Endings That books I like that I never I ... as well as several endings so it was really satisfying to be able to do things again and again and again and differently um so you you\nYou have limited yourself\nParticularly ... with us you know because\nShe is the main character but I Love mine accounts I Love mine a character that was nice to keep bringing them back and do different things that um and messing about\nWhat you eat enough some rabbits and the snow full who on some in some versions of events die horribly and then ... the girl\nThat golden rats [laughter] I'm very glad to see that they had their civil resuscitation that so [laughter] I Know I learned\nMy name's Janice ... dream in salary my question is why does it send many stories of multiple lines\nRichard ... story twelve hundred and one about ... all time and such is Groundhog Day at the time and time meeting for new stuff for three to one way he has the gifts and living ... and different lives in life often knife you have a CNN knitting many lives\nIs this the reaction to the world as we know it and the need for a month to ... to ... with on reality\nWell that's a good question and I think it's um that it's the new playground we have way we can do that because we know we're on a trajectory that has only won ending and really it is only about one journey we [noise]\nMuch as we'd like to think it was not going to have all of those pots I have another son you know the which felt that live but which is there's a character he walks along the street he get snow down by bus oh he will slow down the street she doesn't get run down by bus see me to put you go\nAnd then you sort of these narratives so that they buy for Kate and see and to see into you have\nA completely unmanageable novel [laughter] I I still think about it and I still think that has to be way of rising that so yes most ... is a very attractive to rise has I think that that's you know that ... labyrinth way you\nYou can just do things that you don't even know\nIt just is is there is something I mean I'm told it's scientifically respectable thinking the idea is that they're all multi doses as soon as you know yeah we are at this moment living\nMany on Monday laws I Know I Know it's it's it's fascinating it's fascinating I tell you one day we'll we'll meet or less so [laughter]\nUnless fascinating to another question from the ...\nAnd it came time my name's Emma Lee poster from nuns and I'm a huge fan of your ... especially the ... and I would love to try another one [laughter] so my question is um would you want to live multiply\n'em let my fantasy obviously I have many ... because I keep talking about him I ...

... uh\nAnd the chief executive is Catherine bummed me er and she's in the studio with us now I'm going to Catherine I'm the first question is\nIs there a need for women only drivers syringe there there are women Danica Patrick is the oldest one who's ... who made huge boxers emerges spoke to ... and in ... in the states not everyone's inside for instance me so what is the reason behind it\nWell if you look for in the ones that have been nine hundred drivers over the last sixty eight years and I need to if those drivers have been women\nAnd it's for two years since the last woman driving the full minimum rice we believe that there's a structural problem in involved in sports so W series is being launched today\nIn order to redress not balance uh we're getting to recruit drivers from all over the wild\nAnd we've been to train them and we can time six races in Europe next year and hopefully um we are going to propel all drivers up into Mohseni unserious we won't tell drivers to race against men to\n... you say it's just a stepping stone to you to kind of balancing things up in the world ... rule\nYes indeed might just go to the un you spoke to in the wild at the moment it doesn't have an eight women series and we're not saying that women and men column race together oh we're just want to give women increased opportunity so that they have a better chance of racing against men some very\nMarketplace ... at the moment we have the ... getting bigger the electric vehicles rice\nThe one oversee dominates headlines in the states I mentioned the ... and ... there's a lot more besides how do you call a vow to position in that market price well we believe that\nWe can time from tightly exciting racing the dry desert racing oil racing exactly the same ... which means this is going to be the enemy series that that amongst all the others that you just referred to where we were really find out who the false drivers in the wild and we believe sometimes can be very conscious of\nThe United states or how does that work because they're in for me to want everyone knows the drivers are associated with the change the teams do their own work on their own cause within a setting sets parameters that use the organization will be providing the cause for the drivers in the W ... yes we\nAre in all the all of the cars and our engineers and mechanics within showed

of the last thing is how African economies was yet another new minister\nWell it is a little bit ... I think this is all the sick part that's the area don't just for you to what has become sort of open door at the national trade but at the end of the day we'd obvious ... to ... to actually be shouted political exile\nThe people as you say can keep changing but the problems continue to mount up and not be addressed what do you think needs to be the first thing on the to do list for the new man in office\nI mean despite congratulating she turned away on these point we do have some reservations because it's your trip is all the posting though social media that he's posted over the years they strike a little bit and often seem to be at odds with government\nSimply awful earlier this year ... posted that he thought the forty percent of the line should be owned by the state in South Africa so I think that the first order is for the minister to carry it is it called a\nDifficult decision to invade western minister terrified he's he was on the economy will have to make those difficult decisions ad adults that's difficult to get in a medium term budget out like two weeks target and central she will be a way the old school art\nHow he deals with the fiscal consolidation in an environment where and all that close to Dallas\nWhere every all the way they are major cost pressure particularly in the fall\nOf ... a lawyer will probably six to wage\n... minutes a day to many of them aren't so we have almost repeats late for the south African government put a representative food but they know ...\nSo many things and they will with the business know talk about the ceasefire\nIn northwest Syria which was agreed last month by Russia and turkey or it helped hold off for many people see it would be a a final push by government forces against the last rebel stronghold with all the humanitarian\nDisaster that would have caused um under the plan or the medicines should now have withdrawn their heavy weapons and created eight new demilitarized a buffer zone but it's unclear today or whether any of that has happened or the jihadist than have about five days to leave the zone\nNow the uncertainty is pretty dreadful for the citizens who are ... there are many of them were evacuated from other rebel held areas in Syria you could describe them as ... because\nEndemic if a board game that's intended to represent how government agency would respond to a break out of some sort of\nDisease on a global scale and very cooperative games or wherever we at the table is kind of joining forces to combat the specific diseases tournament eradicate\nPlenty for me it's a collaborative game to save the world\nYou know I mean the scariest scenario impossible to meet your everywhere those duties and that's a big deal for me [laughter]\nI don't know if it was one of the first proper games out there but it's one of the first ones I ever play I ever being able to work with people instead of against them is always fun\nYeah I think it's an interesting way to think about how viruses spread and how we had like a world would have to respond with you Mr player I miss if he made some units their national ability and so if you don't have their speciality and then it makes it much harder for everyone else to kind of nice except for you definitely have to stick together\nWhile not leak off is Jen cone he's going to tax the next game in the theories turn that make legacy season three I'm we will be rights that within watching it has to say I have to find him on in the reason they stay\nOn TV [noise]\nLooking for my for the moment cutting through\nHuge crowd is a man trolls these are the costs play from smoking pot games cool cherished code name century column edition\nGot hit by a member of the shield [noise]\nTo go to our guys getting them in front of them [noise]\nSo I'm not totally stole that he should be on [noise]\nI like\nKevin how long we finally made it a point to and from England and you're like you're freaking out there that can you just heard from\nCertainly happy to figure\nOut how much do you keep paying [laughter]\nMy dad right which is just going a little pop the are enormous memory corona [noise] let's see if we can work our way trade [noise]\nFive months ago I contacted not in California I live on the line with him from Britain and they want us to find out more about the gaming on ... [noise]\n\nHey it is you're in the middle of the creation of pandemic legacy seasons three now wherever you will see we create ... ... ... mail them out\nAnd we ask people to sit down and record themselves so right now or wait for ... Wang posted videos we will sit down and watch our about an hour or so play tested ear\nAnd I have to cook a lot of rewards for myself for example by by make it through an hour or two video I can take a shower or go to a gym we\nGo to get through that much video somebody told me about your family she background I grew up in the mid west or in any way my dad no very a big part of my uh exposure to board games the kid so what games did you play\nWhenever the kid I've spent a lot of really dreadful games or early on a plate Kevin standard bearer monopoly clue and a strict ego and what not one of the stuff that my grandmother had around her farm house they kept all the games there this giant said\nThe criminal hid the games away [laughter] yeah um my mom\nWas when the ten kids and in order to keep the games and some of the border they were\nKept in a closet called the face they it adds a lot that they can [laughter] that was not my memory that we could I Would go in there and that's about what can you paint me a picture of getting in that for the first time [laughter]\nWhether that was that you know about a dozen games in there and that we pull out of a game of risk we wouldn't know what we're doing we just got up and alert which\nYou mentioned that the gangs will rule ... disorder that she became ... the way that he approached playing these games she ... you are right to find them you would changing them\nI mean ah when I like the one that the the farm out it was a matter of just trying to cobble together enough rules that we could have any kind of experience but I got about a game at presidents and I remember the excitement of opening up the box and just the thrill of that takes a fresh new product and you sit down and play it and uh\nAnd it was just dreadful I remember playing one that was mostly based on space invaders well my uncle was pretty instrumental in that they almost fresh memories of working on that particular game with him flipping over the uh\nThe game to go in a couple of days later and they had all star ships and and things that look very exciting to play with so we looked at port over and we spray painted a British stars on it and a\nCritic from Carson products and poker chips and tried to make again about mining asteroids\nAnd contributed ideas but he was he was an artist and very much into making thing and that was kind of contagious\nLooking back who's the creation of the game and the plane\n[laughter] oh yeah very much so it was a that was the making was the fun of it does it totally crashed or does it does it work that little cycle they're like create something and and poke at it and see you know with any fun coming out with that is pretty engaging\nRight well I think that's I think I'm coming up to my time limit on this line at the moment where did you say would be a great time for me to actually kind of have a look at what you do in the next stage maybe\nUh let's see we've got a big national agenda on August ... uh three years we've actually probably a variation this product to Jane common in touch with people in the evening [noise]\n... we can learn about way we are in the creation of print that make light of the season three you'll watch in small videos from across the U.S you'll rewarding yourselves I think if you remember with showers war has seen happening\nInside rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically the the entire year of the game developed so it's sort of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place an hour refining that and trying to make it better and better so it's a it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is now it's just about making it better and I certainly will be a story sets across the the times kind of a yeah that's right so each game is a a month so sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out\nWe can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the games kind of reinforce that ending\nSemi this whole with tens of thousands of people and it will qualities and some railway will begin what happens tonight\nTo tonight's a very important part of our developing process we're going to a meeting up with some place that they're in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location a plane through season three and I'll be watching us I Know that in hand really seeing how the out of the box experience where how their first games work\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend um had tonight it's going to be two couples are for player game we recruited them off the Internet using Twitter to see what I Do not know I've never met we get a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard you\nKinda feel like an old tire below no take you know seeing how it's what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist\nBecause I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible in front of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect but I get ... rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible there's only to find the discipline that you go back to the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions and they get really stuck I don't want to interfere\n'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and this is where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is

thousand dollars\nFor three hundred thousand dollars yeah was keeping the expenses\nAnd that prices come down considerably how much would a burger today and cost\nUm it's it's hard to tell you can only do calculations because for the prices come down to four is it needs to be\nScaled up the production and you need to know exactly what the production system is and\nBut having with a couple of some ... that you can scale up to let's say twenty five thousand leader bioreactor which comes out about ten thousands me for ten thousand people a year that price would be around ten dollars for a

strictly vegetarian including burgers and hot dogs make some plants but not from the sounds of animals\nThat's partly because no one has scaled up to a level where they can feed hundreds of people

figure out are regulatory situation the U.S or we could do it here but it's much more likely to be outside the United states are in poor countries that we're we're talking to we're optimistic um a few
