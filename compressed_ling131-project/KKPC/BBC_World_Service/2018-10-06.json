last year up to ... you might remember Mbali a gun was was was ... so well everyone was being evacuated I was getting in the opposite direction which cost him puzzled looks some tourist off can be where I was getting I said I'm going up to ... um and\nWhat I was struck there is actually how they were really despite having limited constraints of being a not a very rich country by by some measures and they were trying to to to to sort of prepared for these things as effectively as they could\nUh and the ... people that I spoke to seem to spend half of that time traveling between different vocation is that we're about to explode\nAnd the difficulty is also is that I think in this case it was evident that the monitoring systems went whacking but the difficulty also is when do they cool when did when they made the coup because if you evacuate people too early and then nothing happens as invoking people some people believe it less next time\nAnd that's when dangerous things can happen and when people can move back into the home to the base of vocations for example an extent\nUm so I was struck by by basically you know how how how difficult it is to get around to the needs are and how they were spending my time doing that\nBut also how they have to sort of balance or the that that sort of monitoring systems but also with the human the human story of how do you how do you tell people soon enough or how do you make sure that you don't get the full Saddam\n... which was your what struck you as you you've watched this from an heard [noise]\nWell they don't want to

have quite as much else pops invested the things but\nIt it is to me is concerning that seeing things seem to fall apart more drastically and pops is because we were so much closer with the news that it seems to be getting worse and worse and that's my mum\nOn your secured outta Cassandra members I just wonder about whether or not in any part of the world governments Caesar dissolves the it deals with it as often as best you can shoot hoops another one way to cook and therefore the money perhaps he's pledged in the way to do it needs to be\nI mean I don't think it needs to necessarily has enough money to for natural disasters so that needs help from elsewhere I think any ... and and I think that\nThat help has been I I as I understand it to help is being offered up but not not the right thing exactly meat but it's going to be a big test for president Jacoby he faces in action next year\nI'm I've had this been a lot of backlash to towards him into the way the which is one of the

Russian cyber spying evidence over bundling\nOr arrogance the British and Dutch governments revealed on Thursday that Russian operatives would try to hack into the office for the prohibition of

British or ... ... only places of terms to undermine international law on international institutions\nRussia ... behavior\nWhile listening values Joyce Hackman he was a research fellow at Chatham House and co editor of the journal of cyber policy welcome ... were you surprised by ... ... well\nActually I'm I must say that uh what's been going on with the attribution and and so forth is not read it and you think I think what's new is like you know the kind of coordinated accusations are it is quite surprising given the level of the Russians sophistication that they were called ...\nBut I Believe you know when the uh intelligence agencies from different countries they come together and they call it you know a ... their head\nStation altogether that gives them you know like it better or put them in a better place to be able to achieve results and therefore uh we saw what we saw a yesterday\nAnd what does this tell you about the scale of what might be going on behind the scenes here\nWell I mean if you look at a where the Russians are attacks have taken place you know they've uh it went against like organizations in uh in Canada and the U.S and met Asian Brazil and switch that land and and and the Netherlands in the u._k.\nSo they've been keeping everyone quite busy and I that's basically you know and it gives you an idea of like you know how ah how much like cyber to his now are very much\nAt an essential part of the Russians are tools to advance a they're a foreign policy agenda and they use it quite at all and you know and the all the ongoing whether the conflicts on I deal with the concessions that they want to achieve\n... and all those potentially being spotted a poem able to resist first tools effectively\nWell basically I mean uh if you ... the thing is with a sign of crimes inside the taxes like more often than not uh\nThey will be like you know what I had already infiltrate into the system without you know you knowing about it\nSo it's very challenging at you know about all the infiltration into their systems but of course you know I think what happened yesterday kind of like raises more awareness on the Russian activity and I think\nEven though you know some might argue that Russian is not very much like a shame of the nation that is that does cause adaptation of damage and that does ... said the way\nFor a more economic sanctions which would be like really a challenge for the Russian economy now\nLet me bring my guessing to maybe ... of course you know what's on your mind\n[noise] well I was struck I mean I'm kind of drawn the car and and and I don't know much about through to the modern the modern equivalent of fine but I was struck by the ... are released by the I think the Netherlands I'm\nSort of a police about about the kind of how basic it seemed like they were doing you know how to go ... full of equipment or a jacket covering an antenna\nAnd and that they were sort of they came on the on diplomatic passport but presumably but were traced from from that from the beginning so it seems strange to me that we're talking about cyberattacks but then it had a very physical presence in the same time and I wondered about that is that how most of them are done or is is is that are just ... by by that these ...\nI Believe like you know these sort of attacks that combined both uh I was reading so you have to do some sort of like a fun activity combine that with online activity or what happened yesterday with it of relations\nA show that can be for like a an embarrassment I Would say for Russians and that it just because they are they've been very keen and the recent he has to show supremacy and ... and when you know you're caught with like a taxi receipts and like you know all these things and what if your car it shows that\nProbably there's some reckless I Am going on from the Russian policy but also when you are engaged in so many operations across the ... and then you know a sooner or later you would leave some\nAh you know in the distance wide I Would call them digital bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then ah basically lead to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the\nA nice as spies with call in April and we only had about a a decent yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of\nAh coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm just on a purely practical level um\nIt seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives ... incentive we don't know if I say spoken or through the been infiltrated be seen\nReally what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and to me what on setting as a storyteller it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean\nMaybe maybe it that made our image you know at a movie it's a big taboo to talk to a ball to pop them you know and that's why the ... ... ... double was about six years in a relationship everybody knows about it or ... are talking about the problems in public\nYou mentioned a moment ago that some people in Iran have seen the film as well how how available easy for people to watch in Iran\nCan find each in on the black

now [noise]\nI'm not sure or you can go buy a depression is if you can come out again\nThat would be your fear that you wouldn't be able to put their risk and do you think of film like this can change anything in terms of the way a country like Iran operates my\nI think a fitting or generic artist cannot really change something directly but they can ask questions and I think if we can ask the same question to the audience and\nAnd and the audience in each each person asked the same question him says a start to change his mind set so we can change of society in a long time\n[noise] Iranian film director alley Sunday talking about these films to run to boot off ... not necessarily change things Patricia ... it can also questions\nAnd I think that's tremendously important and so how you found it and how you support it becomes tremendously important you know that you have those independent places but also I live really like to say sometimes out can fail it doesn't always have to be a glorious success because that's how you build office in that in in essence what failed this year made five years I be hugely rather than\nBy its very nature it's experimentally exactly ... what did you take out to be interviewed said\nLet's fascination the way that he was talking about how people access to it and to them on the black market and and so on but it will say because even the online and in that I feel that\nThe Internet has changed the way that people can connect things in countries which I'm going to be restricted so I ... I mean the other day about three and did you choose of online channels being incredibly useful for people in India or that sort of a sense in which you know how people get round China's such a great great five\nAnd I feel that the Internet is opening up say much people who are in places that that that they wouldn't normally be present access these things that they didn't have to be in sentiments despite the authorities best efforts to stop doing that exact places exactly\nWhat about the use of animation Patricia the the form of innovation that I managed to mispronounce during that conversation\nAnd you kept it in which I think it's an ... [laughter] what not to me [laughter]\nBut it is that something that's um I think as we become more sort of worldwide and the baby wants to present things we also choose different ways you're telling our stories because I mean it by some graphic novels for example that you are beginning to just huge and pop stores it's not just you know\nCity children's story in the graphic novel because visuals um communicate in a different way in a way that music those as well that the visual outs and and actually tell stories and very popular in this are always so I think any so the technique that he can use 'em is ... valley\nWhat does not protect have to say about that\n[laughter] I thought the elite fantastic when I look at the trailer and times is this is strange in space animated if it will say you get the sense in which it acted happy behind it and I feel that that incredibly powerful\nBecause there was a time and maybe I was just an e seeing certain things as a younger as a younger man but there was a time when you you associated animation waves from an an flip and see\nAnd it wasn't necessarily as you say anything very profound it might it be brilliant you put together but they weren't any deep messages coming out of it is that changing\nYeah that was something called Felix the cat that's really very early southern but yes absolutely it's changing and I think again it's a necessity to tell stories and telling your own stories in the way that ... ... I'm not that changes as a medium changes ...\n... ... ... absolutely I mean I think that we had the mouse the art Spiegelman about that that the Holocaust I feel that as as you said it mean graphic novels have have have really taken on the rain out for the past few decades will say that and I feel that they no longer consider to be you know the kids and and they said if we can reading now\nTo me in there and right Mm well Toronto to booze is available here in London as I mentioned in conversation with how they she Sunday and you will see it here in the coming weeks no doubt you're listening to weekend from the b._b._c.

I Wish I push myself out and more to me I think loneliness is still a\nFeeling like you want to be able to talk to people more but not knowing how like I've looked just like sort of superficial acquaintance e friendships but I don't think many people can really talk about ...\n... about ... to no free lunch you were part of the community that you're in very limited\nOstracized if you're on the weekends I struggle friends all around as much I Do like Sundays I 'cause the family as well so I definitely struggle and Sundays when having much going on\nA remote as well so let me but for these loans or out of a devoted to the pirates are just ... food food or do you know develop that people can reach out food if I was eating circular\nMy what I Know it's just a law student I mentioned that it doesn't always last long so maybe it's a very normal thing to feel at that age and can often be temporary\nYes so that's that's another reason that I think we are seeing such high levels of loneliness and younger people is that\nAh when when they experience it they don't realize necessarily that this is something that can often be temporary\nAnd they also don't haven't rehearsed different ways of coping with it and what works and what doesn't which in itself from I make it last longer so the whole intensity of the experiences is is higher because of course you don't know you can get out of it to or how to get out of it\nSo yeah that's very much that is very recognizable\nIs it possible that older people might feel lonely in the same numbers but fail like counted Mitt to it or don't want to say in the study that they feel and me\nVery possible of course because there is indeed a perceived stigma associated with loneliness and by that I mean that people have the idea that if you admit to learn in us and then you will be seen as somehow we Korean adequate and we did ask about that and we did find that I was a stronger among older people so it's very possible that\nUm it's it's not entirely clear why that is not the case as much in younger people of course\nI'm a buck but indeed that was the case what's also interesting to think about is that we did try to delve into that stigma and try to see well are people who admit to being alone they are really negatively evaluate that are seen as we Korean adequate and we actually found no evidence for it\nSo our participants are fifty five thousand participants were generally very kind about other people who feel lonely and very um positive about them wanting to reach out and help\nSo it is perceived stigma but not so much stigma that actually exists and I think that's interesting to to speak about so that people realize it actually isn't as bad as they think\nAnd of course it's not a competition between the ages and if you do feel any then of course ... ever age you are now some older people such as Ninety six year old Jack King isolated because then no longer so mobile I went to meet him in a time where he lives on the south coast of England\n[noise] really nice to meet you I was a souvenir sphere Murtha is as a prisoner of war\nThat has a role that's my whole ... boss from Boston wow that's a

I don't feel that button for them and then also bed and for me with my sister so I go and have lunch with them when they're alone\nHere in the southeast usual even more during festivities that we all these people are you alone yes okay so that Smeets and have lunch to get the food is a big funding for people\nThat I might as well as your mostly in my case I've never felt lonely because I'm young I've always been surrounded by my friend's family I don't even know what it means being lonely I feel like I always lived in a very strong and you know to family ah I think the family is the face of everything\nLydia and have friend Jenny now before we go I wants to talk about what people can do about letting us we all people to tennis the solutions that have helped them cope with it\nA ... to do

my my friends they now that I didn't even see for not because you're usually comes when you were doing stuff and that's the way I couldn't really nice and I I Love being surrounded by people and I love ... and that's the way I keep myself busy\nEverybody can do something even if it called for a while if I could draw or\nTo probably do more to come up\nAnd then you look at it and it was it last year with it will just go to predict it's interesting that ... jets it has to do something that really distracts you like that because\nFifty five thousand people from around the world have told us what they think about loneliness and the number one solution that people suggested was to distract themselves by getting very involved in whole days old tough times all old look enough he's actually what you said yes it is the also\nSemi weather in the study jak songs of distracting yourself was the one that came out talk but what else was in the top five\nSo first of all the destruction is a is a really interesting concepts because you can also think of it has some simply you know enjoying being by yourself engaging with things by yourself\nBut of course some people will see that as a distraction if they are if they're feeling bad for example the second one was about joining social groups are clubs and of course you'd want to work for everyone I Need one work if the ... you've joined the group that is for example not accessible then you have a disability so the group itself needs to be one that is inclusive\nUm the third one was about thinking positively breaking with negative thoughts cycles which is of course a a a really a problem when you are already feeling quite lonely for quite some time so there are techniques a\nPsychological techniques for this to help people get out of those cycles\nBefore is is it was interesting was about starting a conversation with anyone and small moments of social interaction\nCan become big moments of course and I really liked the example of the the person you spoke to who spoke about\nYou know asking people for a cup of tea that's a really nice way of preparing to have those those little moments because you do need to know what are you going to say but it's also good example of how ... how cultural this can be and how much it needs to work for you\nBecause you know it it it's funny but in in in a British culture of course people want to have to you that's a big thing and\nYet here he writes we must have been yeah by where I come from only people who are ill will have to use the opening of oversight\nAnd the number five was talked to friends and family about your feeling exactly which is an interesting one because we found that the people who said that they have high levels of London is were less likely to suggest that one suggesting it it might be difficult that what what for every one\nOf course it's true and it's it's also true that to to talk about do you use the word loneliness one's saying that might be the most difficult that so\nIt is also about finding ways of talking about that not necessarily say I'm Alone I it can simply be about you know I really would like to to see people more often or you know can we go for that cup of tea every Sunday instead of doing it so sporadically so it is about finding a way to do it but it is a very important one today\nIf you want to hear more about the top solutions in ... which ones might what best for you to download on new ... serious how you can feel less lonely we put a link to it on the health ... website now my mother I Know there's a lot of data still view to analyze\nWhat is the main takeaway few that comes out of the BBC letting us experiments I saw\nI think one of the things is that uh is is this whole diversions between\nPeople perceiving that there is a stigma and being quite ashamed about feeling lonely but actually the fact that we don't find one we do not find negative views of learning as I Am not I think is an eye opener\nAnd it's something that we can actually stress more to to liberate people from that pressure of there being a potential stigma about it so that's something I Would want to pursue more\nWell thank you so much for joining us today man went up but I had I think the only the hard work on this day to day but you said was pulled ...

technical solutions\nCan banks the head of social impact of the digital identity from your study was that average I Wakefield right here put it to him that digital IDs hadn't been fully embraced in developed countries so why should they do presser elsewhere\nWhen you look at developing countries as a starting point it about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still aren't registered as being bullied by the fifth birthday so it's about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nSaid it's just the kind of way as we've seen with other technologies in Africa and other developing um places of leapfrogging existing ways of doing things and gang straight to ditch ...\nIt is absolutely a pipe is still quite important to many of these places but if you're going to and says I got into West African countries all across Asian countries and a good try and help them to register\nChildren being bowl which is the best starting points to register to being bowl and then they technically have an identity going forward so that's the that's the point that people are focusing on quite a lot but absolutely if you can go in at that stage and give them a digital identity rather than giving them ... then um that's that's up for life as they take part in the growing digital economy\nAnd what are some of the suggestions of how we could provide these teach to license

threatening\nTo like ... an ID causing general often feel people with worry about privacy concerns um how can you say the camps that they can sense\nRight well there are a number of different solutions and and uh ideas kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently had a well bank event\nThat tens of looking at digital identities no people looking at ... chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions um central I solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on\nBut at the same time that a favorite political for hackers an odd how recently got a ... a again we hiked number of times recently got hacked and that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so absolutely there's concerns they're all\nUm you know some ideas about using cell phones for an identity is way you have your identity on your mobile phone only you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with a service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your smartphone so it's actually held by you rather than being held in a central place that can be hacked\nBut at the moment there's a number of different solutions that are vying for a time um but the centralized ones which is the most common at the moment all the most

foreigners being thrown around but not certainly Hoff true to the way she is sent back from the main circle of Pacific tectonic activity but it is cool too complex network of geological fools squeezing and bending it every which way and one of them runs\nOn demand a geologist feel ... very well I think produced a comprehensive seismic hazard map of the region only two years ago\n... as a city that sits in the sort of long gated ... valley\nAnd that is a long awaited along a big fall it's called the ... fault which is a big strike slip fault which has considerable relative movement four to six centimeters a year of movement along it and that's quite rapid for fault so it has very high potential to rupture in a large earthquake as it seems to have done\nAn strike slip means that one side to sort of moving north on one side is moving south roughly\nThat's right to the east side of moving north and west sides meaning so\nSo how much movement walls that and how much if not full broke on friday\nThat's a good question I mean it it varies of course along the fault but let's see the U.S just so we shouldn't have about six meters maxim slip but I also saw satellite analysis to suggested about five or six meters slip extended all along the fall through pollen itself\nAnd that's one of the important things as I understand it is that although the earthquake started some distance away it spread and Polly itself was moved it was broken by this as quick\nThat's right that seems to be what happened the thing is the fault goes essentially right through Palo at skirts the western edge of the city but it's right there and if you were close to that it would be very violent shaking\nInnocence I'm getting a picture of ... because of the geological history being incredibly vulnerable to all kinds of consequences of an earthquake like this\nFirst of all is right on the fault as in the narrow valley that's right on the fault this valley is filled with very soft sediments in the sediments can amplify the seismic waves and they're also as we've seen recently subject to liquid faction and then it's right next to ... bay in which an Amish can be generated\nAnd when he talked about liquid French and that's basically when the soil tunes liquid in you know they just still holding buildings up that's exactly right once the questions I've had the non said A's how long it took full the suit on me to arrive off to the shaking in happened\nYeah no one really knows very well because until now we haven't had any data but I did just see that there was some tied gauge records from policy which suggests less than ten minutes of travel time if the timing has to be believed that suggest about ten minutes which is extraordinarily short travel time for this and um\nAnd you can turn that into a distance because I guess you have a decent idea of how fast is you know the way the\nYes you can it depends on the ... century so you have to look at the cemetery and sort of trace the re back and I think it would have to be generated in ... bay certainly not up around and all the way the epicenter was\nAn people when they heard about the nominees recently they've been these subduction full like you have off Japan and ... when the whole see big changes it shaped Maxwell pushes the walls to call them and that's not the case I proceed with the strike slip this kind of sliding motion\nWell that's right so the subduction zones are what are we call thrust earthquakes for when we're the plates are being pushed together in one sort of pop up and down and that of course pushes water and that's what causes the Saddam\nWhere's this fall to the strike slip fault so it involves side by side motion and it doesn't necessarily push the water up or down you know it does a little bit but it's far less efficient in generating salami than subduction zone earthquakes typically\nHowever in this case that could be two things at play you're one would be submarine landslide the sides of the\n... bay are relatively steep and there could have been\nSlumping or land fighting generated underneath the water along that they that could be one factor in general and slowly but also there might be complex fault and we've had the fault on the east side of ... bay and that seems to have switched than to the west side so there might be something happening between those two strands of default\nThat led to uplift underneath the bay\nSo it's still hard to say this point which of those calls this an army\nBut presumably if they ... they can and that kind of thing at me and it's important to do so\nWell I think it's important to do so presumably it's not as easy as it sounds yes you can map to see better you could look for a landslide scarps\nAll he sees the after effects so you don't really know how fast the landslide was and that's a critical parameter in determining needs to nominate generation of it's really fast it will be more effective in generating so now I mean it won't be open and shut case so to speak\nThere's been a lot of comments about this you know the warning system that but what strikes me is that these ten minutes if that's the right time is an incredibly short time for people to read to end up thing and in fact people had buildings collapsing around them\nOnly a few minutes before the ... arrived it strikes me it's a really difficult and dangerous situation for people living in that area\nThat's right that's a very very short time and now says the message with a local send on like this and that are generated you know right off shore the shaking is the war and so if you feel very strong shaking and that means the kind of shaking that makes it difficult to stand in that last for\nTens of seconds you really need to head up hill as soon as you can as soon as sick to do so you should proceed to high ground\nBefore we finish you know this is one full which possibly has released its energy for the meantime dots pseudo lazy itself seems to be the most appalling need complicated tectonic setting that seems to be ... with the price\nThat is true there are quite a few faults and ... these ones that country's central the public coral and associated fault but also in the north there is a very active subduction zone and they're also a couple of active crust of false up there so yeah there are quite a few faults and some of these faults go right near population center\nAnd along with that you also now have this is okay new supper time which she's now erupting I have to us you know I the ... the consequences of what just happened already just shows us how geologically active that whole area base\nYeah it's really hard to say for sure when\nMechanic eruptions of triggered by earthquakes or vice versa those kind of events are connected by the stress field in the interior of the earth or the earthquake will cause a ... a distress field and that might have some kind of\nInfluence on the magnetic plumbing system of a volcano and it's more likely to happen if the volcano was already close to a rupture and and it just took either the stress perturbation or this passage of the seismic waves to sort of push it over the edge and trigger that rupture and that's certainly possible but it's really hard to tell for sure feel come in\nThe Australian National University in camera\nFor something more uplifting to to the

abilities if you like so anti parties or proteins that the immune system naturally makes and they have the ability to target a molecule and bind to it\nAnd what great figured out was how to make these anti parties and make them in a humanized way so when you inject them into humans are body won't think of them as foreign and will accept them and then he also figured out a way on how to improve the finding of the antibodies to its target the Nobel\nCommittee makes its important points that they seize using evolution in the lab\nYes exactly so you have the target and you produce a whole library these anti parties\nAnd then some of them will bind more tightly to your target you choose them and then you amplify them\nAnd then you go to the next round and choose the tighter of those\nAnd so after a few rounds you have an antibody that binds very tightly ... so it's kind of design that immediacy I wouldn't say it's design or because you didn't design anything you let the system choose and that's in fact the opposite of design you're letting evolution of selection choose what on the body to produce\nI chose that were designed because the winner of the other half of the chemistry prize told this program two years ago that evolution is the best designer of all time\nFrancis Arnold was on science fiction actually twice in twenty sixteen first when she was the first woman to win the much thought millennium prize for her chemistry using circle directed evolution and the second time for experiments using it to incorporate the element silicon into living molecules\nReally very simple to direct the evolution of proteins because we can mutate the DNA that encourages protein we can make thousands versions of the protein and rapidly search through those to see which ones are better at something that we're interested in\nAnd this whole idea that evolution can be used rapidly to solve human problems\nI think is very powerful and especially for inventing new

noticed as you've mentioned the sales of electric how's it going up about let's talk about heart attacks and that is no way on pocket to meet its targets agreed under the Paris climate change agreement in twenty Fifteen as anybody\nKnows about that there is a very well to show a dumpster that is no and that's actually something that we've been debating in the parliament that with the past couple of days as well because it's right now I think it's important that we realize that we're not on track towards reaching that that targets\nAnd also that we don't have any significant plan that's Abed its hair mentioned it to how to reduce our climate guessing missions in Norway it's important to understand that the climate policy in Norway over the past Twenty years has been mainly policy on how to reduce ... emissions abroad\nAnd a lot of the work that we've been doing that like saving the rainforest it's been great but it's also in a way to sort of postpone the transition that we need to do in Norway and postponed is really tough choices and how to reduce our climate gets missions\nCan Goodman send to the public in a sense being sold a bit of a a green wash us a puppet note that green after all\nI Will disagree or two cups care about that we don't have a plan I mean seriously we have debated a plan in the parliament and uh we have also a reduction of a seal tool in the atmosphere we have ah as I told a fifty percent electric cars to\nA part of the plan of the taxes for cars I mean we haven't Ciro Texas if you buy a electric car but if you buy a car with the fossil fuel it's full taxes\nSo for example does is active policy\nAnd we have to also take into account that this is a global issue so some of the export of oil and gas is also part of the world so do you have to shut down the coal plants they are more pollution in making this a problem and I mean Norwegian gas can be part of the solution\nBecause new region gases clean up but if you think about ... no way could do given that it's wealthy what shifted to what more can it do get some of these tests should no way in a sense be able to make more choices because of the wealth that enjoys\nWe have to do a look at the same time on many different levels and if anyone tells you this is a magical buttons you can do one thing and then it will be sold that's not true because\nThere's a lot of things to do you have to do energy efficiency you have to do more renewables you have to replace coal with gas like in the u._k. they could use energy for the first twenty four hours last year without the lump of coal because of the region gas that was the solution for them\nAnd of course it's not the solution forever but it is a solution on the way it will take time it will take decades\nBut we're going in the right direction and we have to go on the path\nThat I don't really think we're going to the right direction they discuss that oil and gas policy it's because we continue with businesses your shoulders to political consensus amongst the biggest part is that we will maintain high production levels and we actually subsidize the expiration and or\nThe longer we continue with the businesses to show the harder it will need\nTo go and get away the magic wand and put you in charge you said there isn't a plan what should the plan B well I think\nWe should start taking part of the national debates about how much more oil and gas can put into the atmosphere because if they burn\nAll the research about now reached almost three degrees so everyone needs to take responsibility here and I think the challenge for the government and for the oil industries to first of all run their company in a way to the benefits\nOf ah their owners which is the states with\nA ... and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that many of the plan for\nHow we can get off the perfect fuels because I think there is a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience with oil that ah the public has for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north\nSixty percent totally Norway said that we don't want to open the most vulnerable areas in the north that are flippant areas and the the also have\nPolls showing that people are willing to the oil in the ground for climate reasons can governments\nI think we're missing a a major part of the energy world energy a debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out in the works looks are trying to for example and uh the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders so we have to look on a on a greater scale and I mean that's\nSince my wage an oil and gas is one of the most green ones produced in the world will know if the country's shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because they're specific\nPoint that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat ah the ... islands is very important environmental area in the nose have no way could be opened up to ... really important to marine life important but that's something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nThat's a very uh special area on the whole Silicon Valley as far so do you think the tipping point as far as public opinions consent no I mean it's a question\nUh you know because we have a a political threat from other grownup where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because we produce a lot of\nOil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the is actually part of making a Europe more green gay\nWe have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new region hydro power in the region hundred power is one tenth the energy or what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because if we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nCarry this because he is not the view that shed by much of the Norwegian public that actually ... does is we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out cleaning from the ground\nWhere the good guys and all of us\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfill ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy\nThat's holding your transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany that's going to change the marsh gets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the Norwegian government be grunting new exploration licenses for it and places like the pirates see in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we have and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing in twenty seventh day twenty eight days and that is [laughter] a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate gets ... ...\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about oh yeah those are\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example of gas or even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do all\nThat ferret Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah cats here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw in the ... when I was next sense and and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China I should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to national conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway as the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good ...\nHoff the value of this country's exports of goods comes from oil and gas I left like Elvis student who's noise environment minister it's\nThe country's green credentials tarnished by the fact that they make an awful lot of money for the exposing fulfill feels\nThe need to be in front on taking him to use the sewer mission solutions that are doing with the transportation sector I mean sending more electric cars than anywhere else last month and it was a close to fifty percent of the folks but at the same time\nYou know the oil and gas industry will become a smaller part or economy in the future so we must also have a policy for having a green shift\nWe've been to ... looking at the hydroelectric power plant that this is part of this project that led to Norway being dumped the green battery of Europe\nThe idea that this country can store power that's generated elsewhere in Europe and then send it back when supply from other sources picky unpredictable renewable slumps how realistic is that\nIt is realistic for us to have to argue power here also wind power to be part of the European system so we are building and then become actors Baltimore's Germany ... so that we become part of it is our resources are large enough\nTo become the batteries for Europe I think that his mouth us realistic only this summer to how the drought we'll be old for me to import electricity from from other countries which is really into connected the power will flow both ways\nDo you think the way in which Norway has written if you like to who says you've convinced public opinion that is is a good thing to keep this oil and gas industry it's bringing a lot of money but at the same time you've managed to convince people that switching to hydroelectric power is a good thing where a green country we care about the environment\nHow long do you think you can maintain that writing those two very different horses\nWe are in the ... ... for the world to reads the purse agreement goals we can make a major change who's next for twelve years so we really have to do carbon us the U.S marshals inside of the kind of soft us we can\nBut it's a little Hitler receive that isn't being challenged as it\nIt is a strategy for lowering emissions but it's also a strategy for a social change economic change is\nMultiple their moral question is really about the hard policy so how do we deal with climate change at the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness also in the future\n[noise] that's the environment minister ... Elvis too and he's in a hurry ...\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to how to talk to her at the same time I don't think it's ... ... I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not draw it out of all them\nVarious I'm interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable they've got to go it stops and filled all in the southwest it goes all the way to the north east England and it's going to allow a new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs this innocence done ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've leveled about his role as a fossil fuel producer insider\nMay be I think it's really good for us that we are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can\nActually ended up more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make as much here as you can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted [noise]\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that we have been thinking about energy\nWe haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen the oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that we have to think about the way the use of energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that actually if you want to be part of the Europeans illusion than actually making more renewable energy it could be one of the answers to where we can put our money instead of the guy yet\nGay and when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas to do with the ... they're worried that the costs that they're going to pay are going to go up which suggests that people in Norway adjusted worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even\nYou're trying to save the world\nOf course they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to use your electricity we're been blessed with a ...\nHas given us a lot of energy and different forums over a lot of years\nAnd that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in a way we have a lot of discussions above wouldn't move parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there\nSo it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern that's huge that season to unions because of if you're export power you don't use it for industrial production in no way that discussion above your work about where you live what would you go to do\nIt's a problem there is\nI just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outside of called ... which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local uh energy company or or the regional\nAnd we're actually looking at it together with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply the but actually for a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits your own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars is it is in ... in creating a market for new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables knocked to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of them are in Norway and nobody's really thinking that new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which accounts\nFor other than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come and said well no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though we we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the American sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have one I think you've made it out there I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and that turned ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the speeds of ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it ...",
