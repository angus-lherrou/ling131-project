... in England and Wales into thousands in Seventeen hundred wrong section caught our attention divorces all same sex couples\nSo here's a question which same sex marriages are more likely to end in divorce those between men all those between women\nAnd the dates were clear about Seventy five percent of same sex divorces have been between women\nThere have been slightly more marriages between women but not nearly enough to account for the difference so women are getting divorced from women a lot more for men are getting divorced for men\nAnd this isn't just the u._k. the same problem shown in Belgium in other loans Norway Sweden everywhere whether a statistics on same sex divorce it's the same sex during the ... the divorcing\nThis may just won the war was going on but who could help us with such a question the onset of course is I was always an economist\nWe spoke to Dr marina out shade the Vancouver School of economics in Canada\nShe's the author of dirty money a book which applies economic counties to the study of sex and love and she's been digging into the data for us to try to find a few reasons why it's more likely that women will do most women and men will divorce men\nOne of the things that we do know about opposite sex relationships is that women are significantly more likely to be the one to initiate the divorce so then you might think well if there's two women in their relationship thing you're twice as likely to get somebody who wants out of the relationship if that's true that's one possible explanation for this story\nOkay so what other explanations do you have\nThe second thing that you think about is is how long people have been in a relationship so there's a joke that you might have heard about which is what does a lesbian bring to a second date and the answer is and you're moving van with all of her possessions\nThis in the stereotype they evidences anecdotal but we can't say one way or another if that's the case just because the data doesn't exist\nThere's always a dispatcher is hope is true and if we don't have the evidence than the idea would be less be relationships move will quickly I'm not going to get married earlier and then maybe the maybe an artist and made a mistake\nThey are absolutely so they're they're not spending as much time getting to know each other before they get married there or not ... for several years for example before they get married\nMaybe that would be reflected though in day to we might have for example about the age of the people going into the relationship\nYeah no this is actually something that's really interesting and and it's interesting for me too because this new data set that has just come out as the first one where you've actually being able to observe this\nIs we know that people who marry younger are more likely to get divorce is a predictor of divorce\nAnd if you go and look at the data that has been provided we can see quite clearly that women in same sex relationships are younger than men who are in same sex relationship so they're broken down in in broad age category so it makes it a little bit difficult\nBut in the data that they are only thirty eight percent of women who edited the same sex marriages in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen only thirty eight percent or over the age of thirty five compared to fifty two percent of men\nSo women are marrying much younger than the men and so that could be one of the reasons why we see female same sex marriages divorcing at higher rates than male same sex relationships\nMakes sense I suppose it then poses the following question as to why there is an age difference but we probably going to be speculation about anything else\nWell this is not a thing is that we know that people who may or may first second third maybe fourth time are much more likely to get divorced and people who are marrying for the first time\nAnd that's another thing that we can actually see in the in the data that we've been provided so among the women who are in same sex relationship thirty seven percent of them has already been married once before that is a very high number\nCompared to about twenty three percent of the men this doesn't prove anything but given that we know it's a game that being married previously as a predictor of divorce then that's one possible explanation here and\nAs a researcher looks into this and related questions ... what do you need now to go deep or is it more detail and the date of the officer Mehserle statistics already have or is it different kinds of questions or is it just that you you just need to wait ten years rule is to become a little bit clearer because these divorces only been happening for probably three\nYet time will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example\nOne of the possibility is as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup than men do and this is actually in that data so among the people who've been separated for two years before divorcing\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorcing that our male same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorce is even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the men are waiting a little bit longer they separated we don't know if they separated but they're waiting longer to you know file the paperwork August\nIt's interesting so we implicitly we're talking about observing relationship breakup but she would notice every relationship very aware of serving the finding of paperwork\nMen just take longer to file paperwork\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nAnd are flooded she Christmas parties but you've researched relationships and how they work and how they work so I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witness recently if you'd been out for advice as to how to keep it together and how to keep that relationship going what would you have said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who is an economist who has all the stats on this because you know I see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't last a nine year age gap\nIs almost certain divorce statistics lay right not knowing each other very law these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually tried not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of the most people don't really\n... the corner of the the wedding hole instead\n[laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes out of the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women in same sex relationships do have larger age differences and people who are in opposite sex relationships\nBut this is actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age difference says than people in in opposite sex relationship so\nThe big age difference it could've been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for making comparing women and men in same sex relationship\nSo to me I'd change that and now ... investigates the age old out of rhetoric\nBang bang bang bang click\nPack front and back it's the tag line of a successful Australian campaign to encourage the use the seatbelt

essentially this how'd you get a deal about Britain's future relationship with the European Union but guess what\nCan be sold a divided governing conservative policy\nSo the other members of the European Union has staying in the ... and yes the partner of us have the Democratic union U.S policy which is a a a large part of some policy in Northern Ireland which believes very much in the United

sorts of questions is how do you avoid several months to a hard border between north and on and on the Irish republican essentially that the paper's Protestant policy who helped keep Theresa May and power say you can't do anything but somehow makes Northern Ireland the last\n... as much as I thought I was just about capital if states about animals isn't it because the island is an island okay part of it is part of the United kingdom the north but if you send the animals either way across that see then you are putting them in a territory where they might go into the European Union the European Union\nHas its standards on animal health yes and it wants to ensure that those were maintenance so Michele ... the negotiator said last night\nAt the moment will have to we have a ten percent of\nAnimals checking them it'll have to be a hundred percent because they might get into the ... you and that seems very clear\nAbsolutely ... unless those you might say if people can't say

United kingdom and the European Union it would be an emu bought an absolutely if you're in a different regulation a regulatory regime you have different customs duties as\nHow would you avoid the photo but you know in the way down to the real issue here I mean yes it's about capital but of course in the end it's about politics and about people an ancient problem\nAnd you have to explain that the reason why everyone so anxious to avoid having a ... between the two is because if it was hard infrastructure it could be a target for mainly Catholic next\nLetter the leader of the do you pay the union is to saying we don't want these ... says actually you're giving into the big states you're giving into a Republican militants because you are afraid if you set up a border they will attack it\n[noise] ... yes but on the other hand parts of the peace agreements in Northern Ireland suggests that that should be no border I mean that was passed the trick one of the things that go Catholics in all the ... the north would remain in the u._k. was to make it incredibly easy to go backwards and forwards\nWhat sort of damage has it been doing\nDo as far as your goes we're seeing widespread

Georgia as far as the Georgia coast goes uh we did a tropical storm warnings\nUh stretching from savannah Brunswick but the surgeon Georgia was never expected to be life threatening and never got to

stay for the night because we did have that tornado threat or that lasted through the overnight hours\nWe heard from a major role here that the the storm the harder it landed on the panhandle of Florida actually pick top speed over a month for a while now that's unusual isn't it\nYeah it's very unusual so usually with these tropical systems um their war or eat off very warm water so as soon as they move over land that we can substantially a fairly quickly so to see it again that little bit of speeding strength right away all it is on you\nAnd we're not going to do the climate change question because I think it's widely accepted now ah that that's something that has to be taken into account but actually the ... the ... the ... the waters excuse me while they were more um they're not unusually warm at the moment\nRight yeah that's exactly right so the Gulf of Mexico is just naturally stays warm all year round and as far as hurricanes to grow or tropical system to grow the usually a war between eighty four degrees Fahrenheit\nSo the water was warm it's not unusual for this war and this time of year is just one of those things with hurricane season now that we're kind of
