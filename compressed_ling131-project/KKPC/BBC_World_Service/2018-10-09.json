at us anytime anyplace any way or the hero\nAnytime anyplace anyway\nBecause my TV is the right one\nSounds so good and then you think about it you realize any place in any way I mean exactly the same thing that's an example of rhetoric tricky in your mind\nIf our ideas and opinions are being shaped by the words and others isn't is essential that we're able to recognize how those words are being tailored to subtly persuade us in certain corners of academia this is something of how can I say this rhetorical question\nBecause there's all kinds of documents probably about ... rhetoric is economics can always argue about the actual thing they study actually is probably about whether we should just be looking at the great speeches of the great Randall politicians are often present\nOr whether or not rhetoric is something that lots of people do all the time and everyday conversations and but people all your work is that rhetoric has well over the kinds of ways that people might try to get other people to share that will view to agree with him about some proposition as to what we should do about sweatshop\nAlan ... is a professor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia in the u._k. in the classroom where we meet he's tearing a workshop called a crisis in rhetoric\nThe idea behind it is that we think there's a lot of sheltering them at all in dispute in a public debate so we want to focus on how people that try to put for their arguments Swain each other's positions they hold on\nThe Internet provides a platform for anyone in the world to share ideas and opinions\nArguments are common but debate all too often descend into acrimony went thoughtful pros is sacrificed for purchasing posturing\nOoh [noise] the ancient Greek philosophers have played him defined rhetoric as the art of ruling the minds of men and he was concerned\nIt could be used as a way to handed to the people his student Aristotle believed it to be an essential political skill and was the first to lay out what he considered to be the three pillars of worthwhile rhetoric [noise]\nThe first of those is what we called ... which is an argument to do with the character of

it can be a way of building walls between people who could we could also be a way of breaking down or building bridges are finding common ground between people\nAnd finding that common ground is crucial in a world facing a myriad of complex problems such as climate change political upheaval and economic inequality knowing how to build\nHowling pros out of ordinary phrased it can make it possible to alter the course of history\nAs a rhetorical from cold enough for which is a very simple one is what you just repeat the first words for sentence again and again we will fight them and the

you don't hear that you hear the we will fight again and again and again and it was a brilliant wherever inspiring a national\nLaying it out like that in no way diminishes the power of Churchill's rhetoric but it does provide insight into it\nSkillful techniques big set speeches a rarity today in the age of nonstop tweet news updates and digital distractions\nDiscourse feels like it's becoming more immediate less considered and often aggressive what should be raised in rhetoric can deteriorate into the quest for the perfect put down\nTo create a narrative that people are drawn into that requires a lot of language that requires time it requires patients\nKendall Phillips is a professor of rhetorical studies at Syracuse University in upstate New York\nAlso hard to analyze the argument or reasoning of a treat\nTo two hundred eighty characters is not a way for me to lay out a logical argument with a major premise a minor permission to conclusion it's much easier to just use a two word phrase or hash tag\nThat usually ends up adding to that kind of political division between my side and their side to more and more we have to learn to be critical consumers are the messages around us and we need to understand what it is that makes it persuasive and then ultimately make a decision for ourselves\nWhat are we willing to be persuaded by\nProfessor Phillip ... is also a past president of the rhetorical society of America\nOne of the things we see particularly in politics around the world these days are what would be considered fallacious arguments one that we hear a lot especially in democracies is what the Romans called at population which is an appeal to the people and this is when you sort of say well everybody agrees\nEverybody knows everybody's saying all of us agree to this\nYou talk to every single expert and you just talk to ordinary people you talk to businesses everybody understands that the problem is not getting better\nJust getting worse when maybe we actually don't all agree to this\nBut you're just creating the illusion that there's some public opinion whether it's actually not any opinion that's been articulated by the public the other that we hear a lot in contemporary politics is the ad hominem which is an attack on the person and so especially I guess in our country it seems of last few years\nYeah no this is actually something that's really interesting and and it's interesting for me too because this new data set that has just come out as the first one where you've actually being able to observe this\nIs we know that people who marry younger are more likely to get divorced is a predictor of divorce\nAnd if you go and look at the data that has been provided we can see quite clearly that women in same sex relationships are younger than men who are in same sex relationship so they're broken down in in broad age category so it makes it a little bit difficult\nBut in the data that they are only thirty eight percent of women who edited the same sex marriages in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen only thirty eight percent or over the age of thirty five compared to fifty two percent of men\nSo women are marrying much younger than the men and so that could be one of the reasons why we see female same sex marriages divorcing at higher rates than now same sex relationships\nAnd that makes sense I suppose it then\nPoses the foreign question as to why there is an age difference but we probably gonna be speculation about that and it handles\nWell this is another thing is that we know that people who may or may first second third maybe fourth time are much more likely to get divorced and people who are marrying for the first time\nAnd that's another thing that we can actually see in the in the data that we've been provided so among the women who are in same sex relationships thirty seven percent of them have already been married once before that is a very high number\nCompared to about twenty three percent of the men this doesn't prove anything but given that we know again that being married previously as a predictor of divorce then that's one possible explanation here and\nAs a researcher looked into this and related questions ... what do you need now to go deep or is it more detail in the dates to the office rational statistics already have or is it different kinds of questions there was just that you you just need to wait ten years rule is to become a little bit clearer because these divorces only been happening for three\nYet time will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example\nOne of the possibility is as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup than men do and this is actually in that data so among the people who've been separated for two years before divorcing\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorcing that are males same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorce is even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the men are waiting a little bit longer they separated we don't know if they separated but there are waiting longer to you know file the paperwork August\nIt's interesting so we implicitly we're talking about observing relationship breaker but she will not observing relationship ... serving the finding of paperwork and maybe men just moved from paperwork\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nAnd a lot of the question was posed putting research relationships and how they work and how they work so I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witnessed recently if you'd been out for advice as to how to keep it together and how to keep out relationship going what would you said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who is an economist who has all of the stats on this because you know I see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't last a nine year age gap\nIs almost certain divorced statistically right not knowing each other very long these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually try not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of the most people do\nIn the corner of the the wedding hole instead\n[laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women and same sex relationships do have a large age differences and people who are in opposite sex relationships\nBut this is not actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences than people in in opposite sex relationships so the big age difference could've been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for making comparing women and men in same sex relationship\nEconomist do to marina

actually attending the world series in Los Angeles and I I purchased a ticket\nOnline uh and it turned out to be from a fraudulent third party seller and and now it's this on Facebook and I got a message from some random guy but never met before who said I live near the stadium when you combine my house and we can smoke up as I was a very you know public stoner and everyone wanted to\nWanted to get high with me right so\nI went and I smoked his weight and then I had this joint that I bought at a store that had crystallized G.

I wondered if you could paint a picture of her is nineteenth and she is Harlem and the jazz scene because this was a hotbed of African American intellectuals and coups style listen it\nYes it was and I'm\nHelen became this mecca for African Americans what was known as the great migration that taking place from the south to the north where a lot of African Americans were fleeing racism segregation lynchings were hoping for a few chip\nMusic film electric chair down photography\nAll become to flourish and for me such ... such as James van disease traits of a couple in um\nSimilar looking raccoons said codes and sitting with a Cadillac car epitomize this idea of the like climate that came to symbolize an aspect of how them at that time\nI'm wanting to what is his last the giants and the big band music but as long as that conform to their expectations but John it's right isn't it that there were different performance styles around in the Nineteen twenties and thirties and it's important to understand how they just said in order to appreciate how the concept of cool developed so tiny briefly citizen\nSo and then I think thirties the front man of a big band like Duke Ellington are kept how he had to be sort of a dandy and aristocratic person because that's what white Americans expected this is a highly racist period\nSo there had to be a certain amount of what you cater to the audience is a compromise to playing and creating the kind of artistic music you want it to create\nThere was something cool to me was that that can you explain not\nSo the mask of cool is in immediate direct reaction to uncle Tommy pretty much all African Americans had an Uncle Tom in public in front of white people which means they had to smile and and tougher and pretend\nThey they knew their place if not they were often actually treated violently by the police by anybody and\nSo the main jazz musician who Uncle Tom public was Louis Armstrong as great a musician as he was he had come out of the deep\nSouth and that's what he has learned is that that's how you survive\nMoonshine in [noise]\n... you know [noise]\nVotes Bruning\nSolvent low\nAnd cool was a math but say we are not going to smile or differ or laugh anymore where\nArtist when musicians we're human beings and we will not allow white Americans to define who we are\nAnd into the environment will to socks off in their schools Lester Young who Joe you believe defined cool and one of its earliest forms in American culture right\nWell Lester Young took the word cool that was then heard in the after American community and he's the first person to use cool as a state of mind as a philosophy as an static\nWhen Lester Young said I'm cool he meant I Am here in my own style in this environment um and I'm relaxed which is not something that most\nBlack Americans could feel anywhere in the Nineteen forties\n... can you just give us an idea of young for center in style\nSo Lester Young was cool what that means at the time was he invented several different strategies we still associate with cool and they were all at first to defy racism and protect him\nSo one was not only did he speak in a jazz slang you also had very personal jazz flying such that it was impenetrable it was a code\nSecond of all she wore sunglasses at night and onstage and sunglasses shades are in fact probably the single object most associated with cool\nIf you actually tax the word cool what comes up as an icon with sunglasses on so sunglasses provide a sense of mystery that's why they work that way\nBut she ... them at night and onstage as a way\nOf keeping white people at arm's length\nAnd so we had shades the flag he walked in a very relaxed matter but most of all Lester Young saxophone style was cool it was an urbane romanticism that was both elegant and expressive and arithmetic and it was one of the most distinctive artistic styles of the ... century [noise]\nHere's a brief Lester Young himself speaking in Nineteen fifty nine about the way African Americans were stereotyped\nWho is in [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... Lester Young speaking not long before he died on a recording that features and the forthcoming film president of beauty direction by Henry fettuccine since we've had that Lester Young embrace cool and influence other jazz musicians including the next generation people like the Trump is a Miles Davis he's music ... at the beginning of the program\nCarol can you briefly remind us who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\nWell Miles Davis was an African American trumpeter and band leader and became iconic in terms of how he changed jazz music Miles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music\nPeople could actually listened to him follow an even home to so much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style and this meant um jacket and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would buy clothes from shops on university campuses in the United\nStates where that is bound we'd play so there's an um an album called the museums of miles and he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise]\nSo it's very unusual he was Nineteen fifty five\nDays in a um says look a jacket beautiful ... a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black that far I Am deal with it\nHe's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style of young white men are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why was\nThat this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public stick his hand but more generally in sexual terms because he said something about your family you have this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties the way we still British colonial subjects posed was important to them\nTo stretch this idea of visibility that sense of pride making a life for themselves in Britain despite over in spite of\nThe racism to pull up a system that was rife in in Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nUp to this point we defined cool is largely an African American concept something that was developed my jazz musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one cache of lying and one time my wife doesn't\nSleep and they all over America\n\nAll and Jimmy Johnson all the towns and all of them were\nWalks in a mine [noise]\nHumphrey bike I'm as Rick Blaine unduly Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael coaches including this was a new type of crew which ... the concept the Hollywood movie audience with the new ... what was known as filmed while how does filmed while relate to cool\nWell film water protecting us are disillusioned I'm cynical the owners who often get embroiled in criminal activities this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detect affection [noise]\nIn the shadow ... world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd so they were a jazz clubs all the time and particular Jack Kerouac rights on the road and is the best known of the beat generation writers was a huge jazz fan on facts he calls himself a jazz poet\nOr in his book Mexico City blues so what's really interesting about this period is they they take this new term cool that they hear a jazz clubs and among African Americans and they're fascinating assessed with it\nAnd so in that period a coward writes a letter to his friend Neal Cassidy in Nineteen fifty says I'm obsessed with cool to the point of a theory\nAnd he goes on to talk about his own obsession with the term so jazz is the first art form which cool expresses itself along with Bill Maher and the writers of the ... generation\nUnderstand that they are looking at a very new definition of artistic expression and improvisation and that's what they're going to take as their method and so the reason I say it's not quite appropriation is it's an artistic method and then they say well how would that work and literature\nAnd so ... actually calls his writing style bop property which means bebop prose which means jazz writing and so to that effect it's an artistic transfer more than it is a racial or a sort of a theft\nThing the unfortunate part of it is that correct did not represent African Americans as well and literature as he did understand jazz as amusing\nLet's have a short extract from Jack Kerouac famous novel on the road\nBack then I was always looking for what your job pretty good for a long way\nA better life free life\nAn alternative you know away from the nine to five away from the men and recruits wanting to sell ya after she refrigerators life insurance [noise] we had no idea what form that new life my technical for dean at with kicks in bomb fuel you could make it sound um if you want\nBut at least he was looking for

I graduated from college and decided to just help her do a business plans and help set everything up and so that the process same place\nSo that the mistakes that she made in the past would not happen again so that's how we got stopped it but that was nine years ago and a lot of things have changed since then so that one of the reasons why I decided to joined a business fulltime was I found that that was a gap between what consumers were looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nA lot of people go for the show treatments ... treatments added ... or they will get official a relaxing one at a spa\nThere wasn't hardly anything that was in between to offset really really intensive facial treatments where they could healed his skin treat any problems ... problems and at the same time provide that level of relaxation and also the medical level kind of expertise behind how to treat a skin\nSo many ... how did you get your business or just I mean how did you get started\nI watch infection function people in ... because obviously they want new new news from the point in fashion so I simply just told anyone who listened I'm into I can announce a and it's going to be the phone as well and I told everyone not like the few months leading up to it\nAnd sure enough by the time we open to people were talking about it before we even opened\nI also paying taped the front of the ... bright pink and right now so I'm coming soon [laughter] helps house and like all of these things I did like I said I was twenty four twenty five without even thinking if I ... I can look to is a case study the ... of how to launch round\nI invite said very specific goals in fashion to come and get the nouns done\nWe have to persuade a culture of people that ... was it gets to ... you know this isn't ten years ago now not was not cool\nJust off even before that before you were convincing people and getting your influences teach embrace the work that you were doing what

hairdressers\nRight around me off the top you had it's very difficult\nTo do I even while awaiting a chance to to to to answer that question you know I I I Love this kind of ... yeah I just didn't I just feel so passionate about this because it's reflective of so many industries that the very booked him\nMen and women all on a level playing field to go out I should go up it changes as you go with him the T yeah very very few women putting\nYes this is something that I Know does as well\nFor hair actually if a stylist is at a director level whether they are female or male doesn't make a difference in the amount that we pay for them\nAnd it doesn't make a difference in among that day bring home I've got friends who are personally in this industry and it's more about the level of expertise\nAnd you're right that in terms of makeup and hair we do see that Islam is dominated especially in the fashion industry strangely do in the beauty industry we don't see that many men in fact I have\nHad zero in the last nine years of applicants apply to be a therapist\nSo I think by the fact that there is a very very tiny fraction all next to norm males in this industry it might be a little bit sleeping to say that is the cause dealt with Mendez ... low\nMaybe you're right that is very difficult to pay above market wages for the technicians while doing it but if it's a male technician who is doing any job\nI Believe the pay would be the same as a woman if you know if we compare but as we go up the boardroom yes there is more men but when it comes to small businesses versus a big now to national corporation I think that the game is a very different and I would like to think that women are given very very far\nApart unity in Singapore at least in the beauty industry somebody when you look back at your career yeah what do you consider to be your biggest say\nAnd how you recover from it [noise] this is gonna sound so whacked by just don't believe in this whole ... thing\nCome on now I'm being serious I actually ... ... is a celebration of cricket my journey much and so I'm On the inside I added Jenny my journey was random ... any of that ...\nWas a series of experiments that I learnt from\nIf you really want to force me to say a foul yeah I Would say it's not realizing oddly enough the power structures within beauty to not make the right amount of money that I could have made very early on in my career because I was guided Rome late by powerful men\nRight I Would say that I had many opportunities to capitalize on a trend that are created or we rather as a team\nBecause then we change the culture of not allowed to didn't exist in the west to what you did not own at no point did any of the men I spoke to who wanted to invest all develop

can bend in the ... signed by some one thousand six hundred scientists from around the world\nDon't you just wait is a physicist at imperial college here in London she was in the room and professor ... gave his talk\nThink everyone was quite shocked that thing that I found the most damaging and the thing that I have such about myself too it's just that he was talking to a room full of early career such as any of his face\nIt could be telling that room for the body career such as they need that because they were women and that they wouldn't get any way going forward because it's there but if the that just kept going forward because of tokenism and the reason that the ... might have been stunned into silence is because\nThat one of them very very tenuous create false everything that you do in science is a kind of short time contract journalists three or four years post and at the end of that you have to be recruited again and interviewed again and come forward before a panel that could include someone like this professor\nSo you're very wary of speaking up and and being a tool known as someone who might make any trouble\nPeople will say well it's free speech he has every right to go up and say these things and the things he quoted for example Oxford University extending exam times offensively to help female candidates in stem subjects these are all things that have happened not fit\nInto ... extension of time because they knew that goes for questioning narrative at at the end not confident enough when they were deciding the questions that that doing exams\nSo this wasn't saying goes a less able and I think that this kind of thing when a senior professor comes in and says you know you are intellectually in the area that will only make them less confident\nSo the only reason for it they're supposed to give them the fat chance because they realize that they were going through an awful lot of impulse to enjoy about being on a course where that surrounded by boys you have these kinds of opinions and that maybe they needed to get them if either a ...\nA deep sense in the scientific community that there is a bit of pushback from perhaps none of the sudden generational men generally who are bitter about\nSeeing women being given preferential treatment in the in the process of trying to make the field more representative women for example he will so I think gave the example professors dream of Melbourne University offering women only clauses in stem subjects and also advertising mass positions only for women\nI've never experienced that and certainly in the kind of food out about this event\nThat people who have been really angry and really saying oh yeah this is completely right\nAh people either with absolutely no academic affiliation anymore or people who work within this one particular area of high energy particle physics\nSo I don't know what the ... area of theoretical particle physics has a really hard time in recruiting women and it's and in that sense has done these things I mean I Can't comment on that\nBut I Would say that the men that I've encountered have been incredibly supportive of initiative to encourage more women to to participate and to be retained within science\nSo he's not representatives and anyway I genuinely do not believe he's representative I think unfortunately these kinds of opinions give voice to an awful lot of angry chosen line you seem to really really like getting what about things like this I don't know if you had time to read the\n... ... put forward by about two and a half thousand people walking within particle physics from all over the world and they will find that very very well versed in life to\nArguing his points case by case and saying you know this isn't true this isn't true you've gotta go here and look at the states and this has been fined by senior women and men within the failed so I really don't think he is representative I think he might be\nFrom a particular school of thought that type late on the way out in science because the majority of people recognize that diverse teams do you buy the science\nDo you think it is with us in science in terms of gender inequality and sexism and the industry than in most of the field\nI think that an academic science you have very very weighed Powell relationships that you don't have in other fields so you'll direct Korea policy is determined by people like this so professors who have ultimate power if you're going to do in your life\nAnd that's all that opinion really really matches the majority of people who are in senior positions are old men because that's what history has done and we've not go to a stage yet where we can change that\nSo I think that this bizarre power relationship with an academic science\nSuch and he makes these kind of beliefs and ideologies a bit stronger than in other professions\nDon't suggest weight at imperial college here in London where women are pushing back Keli Ramirez is this soil microbial ecologists and cofounder of five hundred women scientists it's a grassroots organization that aims to promote diversity in the field\nAnd it was set up just off the election of President Trump and twenty sixteen today of twenty thousand people have signed up to Ames, Iowa last ... years what a group subject is originally political\nIt's not political it is about creating equity in the sciences it's about all of the collective inequities that women face and that can be from having someone tell you you're a girl so you're not any good at math\nOr are you sure you should be in this class are smart enough to be here and that comes pretty early on through high school and maybe in your early college years once you get into grad school not only are people questioning whether or not you should be there and your intelligence and if your degree has been good enough\nBut then they started to question your leadership skills and whether you can be in charge of students or projects\nAs you move farther into your career there are paid discrepancies and we started originally just wanting to support from and signatures as we had a pledge and we have that on line still you can read it it's quite nice tell us what the pledges it is an open letter that we wrote as\nThe women in science asking scientists women and supporters of women scientists to stand together and change the face of science as it is today\nWe have a signature on the pledge from over one hundred countries so we have over twenty thousand people who signed a pledge\nAnd what did you how to take this we hope\nTo be a fully funded sustainable organization that continue to push\nTo make science open at ... and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists do at five hundred women scientists within America are succeeding and we want to make five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline that are profiting from Mr Right we can keep moving up and up\nRamirez or what Kelly and don't you just wait say suggest as a structural problem with science in academia but women also just not as visible last week professor Dona strict and became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics a day later another one from says on those won the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nAnd despite professor strict in historic achievement her biography was conspicuously absent from the world's fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on\nRebecca get is a ... in history of science at the University of can't she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it ... find a space within the culture and I'm within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy as it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of ... it wasn't necessarily particularly well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to economies or to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing is I'm Sorry to say\nI'm One of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being more dangerous or less serious or an intelligent because of the way that gender roles\nOf being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being inflated why are they may want to hunt and don't pay anything\nBecause that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding women lead to more authority\nAbsolutely and particularly once you get to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public say so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so that as a muscular and kind of ... is going on and on owning a living and so and\nSo when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it says something way there is a uh Korea policy can fall I

at least during your salary is nine dollars a day which is more or less than actually uh somebody makes in in a McDonald's\nOr how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the rangers or it is being on drugs but where's it going I think\n... ... ... so we have to look at three\nThree liberal substitution number one is the rangers or the government employees so it'd be neat to look into the policies that are beside the recruitment of free just training of ranges that insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those reforms needs to come the ... the the challenge we had it all yeah we didn't have the quantifiable data that we can speak to the politicians ... just started really bad shape change your policies now we have that information so that has to be done all the things that we shouldn't groups and\nI'm interested people need to come together to address the policy and number two is all the conviction group also need to invest more resources and the basic needs for example a piece of study clearly shows\nAnd when you say that you mean fighting between different armed groups yes\nAnd there have been a number of attacks by by armed groups and every every day or two really over the last number of weeks or our our teams have not been directly targeted but obviously or were there and it's very difficult to maintain\nA operations and even even without that there are challenges in terms of the response it's spread out over a large area now I'm a mother just sticks are quite challenging and we have had some uh mistrust and resistance at the community level as well which in itself has been challenging\n[noise] um I I Want to get on to that in the ... in a moment but just on the on the the the the wider security situation what does that mean for humanitarian workers who simply mean they cannot get out into the field and to do the work if they were shooting going on\nA well unfortunately for us that that's hardly a choice when the two Bola I bowl at us in restive we rest unable to doesn't stop we stopped so uh the operation imperative is to get out into the fields to trace cases find contacts vaccination\nContacts in context of contacts using giving ring vaccination strategy so\nFor us it's an absolute imperative to be out there we do all desert rats chewed to a new school to the UN peacekeeping operations there who have provided excellent security for our teams and we have not been directly targeted but certainly the violence on the attacks have really increase the level of press\nThey've also increase the amount of security apparatus in the amount of security arrangements we have to put in place so that's increasing the demands on the operational teams it's it it also increases the stress levels amongst our staff so the length of time anyone can stay in the field is short and because of those stress levels\nTell us a little bit about mistrust amongst local communities particularly as I understand that with regard to that people's ability to to carry out traditional burials which may not be be be safe and this has led to a few attacks on humanitarian workers have you ever come up\nIt's typical we've we've seen this in many many ... and I and I think you know in context if if if if you have a debt than any community and that doesn't matter if it's a north ... who are or or north London\nA this is a risk disease that people have taken away quickly in a in a very very um a severe way I'm communities react to that uh they have very traditional means of of caring for of preparing buddies for burial and burying people in the spiritual aspect of this is is is very very important\nSo when outsiders coming to remove bodies when outsiders come in to remove sick people with communities can react\nAh and react very negatively so we have a lot of work with communities to engage them to discuss to talk to negotiate and a ... by and large that goes extremely well we're very skilled communicators local Congolese on an an an international staff who do that\nBut on occasion that dozens a goal so well and in particular situations and we've seen this and and witness this recently where there has been a an element of manipulation or\nA triggering of that response by elements within the community who are are looking to create and foment political or community um disruption or so when you have a single incident it can grow into a much larger incidents\nAnd very often that's that's driven by individuals in the community we're really pushing the community towards that kind of response this is a very um disrupted a community or they've\nHad ten Twenty years of war they've had attack after attack they've had massacres or are they bulldozed is just the latest scourge that they're having to suffer\nA one question on on vaccines um after the outbreak of course in West Africa how much of a game changer has that been your ability to contain this outbreak\nUm ... I think it has been a huge game\nChanger into a ... down the lines of data will tell us just how effective it was an assigned to in scientific terms um and we believe it is effective and has been proven to be effective in the past or at the village level it is a huge game changer because in the past we come to very bodies we come to take sick people away now we come with vaccine\nAnd if you're in the village of a hundred to two hundred people who are almost everyone has been exposed\nA bringing a vaccine that offers hoped to those people that they may not get the disease and they may not die creates a huge demand from the community for that service or an changes I said to them to pass to\nAh walking into villages in the past I was it was a seeing people with terror and the rise now you see people who are hoping the rice they're not happy they are upset they've lost a loved one but at least they can have their children vaccinated and that's changing the dynamic\nBut having said that even with that vaccination available even with new therapeutics available at the treatment units which is again a game changer\nAre there are still pockets in the community of deep mistrust this mistress goes back a very long time and that mistrust can be manipulated\nAnd can be turned against the international teams uh and we just have to work through that we have to grind through that in the daily communications process with those communities it's made all the more difficult because our time with those communities is limited by the general security situation\nSo it's like a double whammy you can't operate completely freely you can spend the time you need to spend with communities to engage and communicate with them both Ebola outbreak\nAnd in that process communities don't get a complete understanding or can be influenced by others and you get the community response is a woman who won a negative forces driving another negative force\nAnd that was a doctor Mike ... of the W.
