investigate those allegations so what exactly will involve David go Mrs retired FBI special agent you know it's just a ticket procedure well I asked him some more details on the scope of the investigation\nWhat we know from media reports is that the president has or what's known as the supplemental background investigation of a judge Kavanaugh to take a look at the allegations that were raised during the testimony before in Senate confirmation hearing\nIs a weak enough because Democrats and others are saying that simply not enough time to get to the buffet some of some of the issues are arriving here as a write off to fish will deadline\nWell it may not get to the bottom of every issue but it's certainly enough time for the FBI to complete the task that they've been given initially from the president as I understand that the task was to interview\nFor a of individuals whose names were brought up during the hearings professor for mark judge in Mr Smith and there was the fourth name that I don't recall\nAll of whom you can either corroborate Dr Ford Oregon corroborate a judge Kavanaugh's versions of events that's a very small task actually very simple to locate it in your view those people regarding the allegations\nMark judge of course this is the friend that Brett Kavanaugh who's are accused of being present when some of the alleged issues took place he said that either he doesn't recall ... problems or is that some of the statements on the accusation simply wasn't true\nWhat ten FBI agents sitting in front of him do differently to ... to find out what he is saying holds water will not\nWell one thing that happens when the FBI comes up to interview you is that there is an admonition usually the book or the false statements to the FBI is separate crime from anything else that they might be investigating so there is usually a\nGood reason for a person tell the truth but the second thing is the FBI investigators there'll be sending out our experience ... investigators they're independent of politics and the process\nThey want to provide a balance look at the allegations and their skills are getting people to confide in them where they might not complied with the press the media or or partisan politician so the the hope is that they will ah open up to the FBI and perhaps\nTheir memory will be\nWill be stimulated by the uh the occasion they'll provide additional information that may lead other other places\nAnd is it your under our understanding to the FBI would that have the authorization to do those subsequent interviews it required\nWell

prepared some food is in the kitchen Henry's and his little room which is right next to the kitchen\nAnd so I guess I'll just jump in\n... uh Lewis has just made a plate of spaghetti and then he says\nOh no there's a cockroach on my food or a boatload\nWhat should Henry a cockroach on top of my spaghetti you forgot the first rule of survival in this apartment that Henry without sympathy never leave food out you didn't teach me that rule are said you should have learned it before coming here the enlisted in the military if you're not prepared to fight\nI threw the passed away and the cockroach since I'm unable to kill anything directly even cock roaches with which our apartment was infested though no one had ever been so brave estimate my food\nAfter dumping the pasta I bought some more water and started all over\nHenry From us coach told me to wash my dish and added that I should always washing my dishes before eating\nHe explained to me teaching me some survival rules after all that are cock roaches we're walking all over our plates while we slept leaving behind an invisible trail of germs so we were to wash dishes before eating as well as after\nHe came into the

York has led into ... water that you might not have learned in New Jersey Henry looked at me intently to make sure that I understood the lesson and then said ... for cockroach cold for lead hot for cockroach code for led\nBy God it I said well don't catch on to quickly that's the problem with staff once they know what to do they leave\nIt was a backhanded compliment but it made me feel good you didn't want me to lead\nOh I'd love that thank you so much I Know that you have a folk singer named the herring won because you have actually boxed into that yet why did you do that\nI got into the ring because I had a romantic notion of fighting you know lifting up those ropes and getting in there it was almost like when I was a child I used to wrap towels around my neck and pretend to it was a Cape than I was a superhero\nShow boxing was a chance in real life to place your accent and then I got in the ring and I discovered\nOh well one it's terrible to be hit and I know you're I've learned a lot of our brain injuries since they're not very good to be pounded in the head and then it was terrible to hit other people I I Would hit someone and I'd see their face grim is and I would say oh I'm Sorry in my trainer the\nCourse of don't apologize method that point of it\nOr I should say I was called the herring wonder\nBecause at the time and I still do I ate a lot of herring and I followed it you know it's a it's a fish low on the food chain so doesn't have a lot of mercury has a lot of oils and it's good for the brain especially if you're getting hit so that those blows and the brain killed some brains out\nBut the oils from the herring build them back up so to sort of maintain that equilibrium and Disney sting well yes that was my other thinking was to have herring breath in ring\nTo further repel my opponent so I Would come into the ring with a jar of herring in my hand you know like a white with spinach and then my fans in the audience were waving silver herrings\nBut then you say this is another thing I could be a really good to have an ... or some way of like putting off your pain that you make some very strange noise yes that go back to your fourth grade school days late ... because you were in a and a little town called ...

hairy call\nAlready heard from the music icon on the show Janet Jackson now an eye on that movie at Seventy one Glenn Close as being a film stop the thirty six years first\nPlaying dependable supportive mothers and wives in movies like the Big Chill and jacket edge and then so memorably as the most likely challenged anti heroines and dangerous liaison with and fatal attraction was late just found the wife is about to celebrate it American ... played by germs price\nWhose spouse might have more to do with the writing of his novels than he would like to admit the film begins quite unusually for mainstream movie with the sex scene between two ... dictionary and said the BBC's ... off Glenn place how was it uh\n[laughter] yeah so the first scene that we shot was it [laughter] which\nActually looking back was probably the best thing to ship shoot first because certainly we had to trust each other and it really kind of established\nThe fact that they still had to sexuality together which I think it was very important\nAnd the loss of last yes but the audience ... off yeah they predict it's very tough because it opens with this great love them from the ... and then it slowly yeah it seems to me that the whole movie pivots on your ability\nTo not overstate to overplay full fucking ... gradual\nI Can't do this anymore\nWhat fascinated me about this role 'cause I had to answer for myself why she never left him\nJoe please don't thank me near the beach for [noise]\nI don't want to be thought of a long suffering wife\nYou understand that you know\nThat we once actually white [noise] bottle record you know one sentence will be by [noise]\n\nAnd then another tricky thing about this piece was that you see us in the very beginning and you see is at the end you don't see any of the middle so you had to have a great idea of\nWhat most of their life had been like because the audience doesn't see that\nI Know you'll you'll always be known for playing Alex in a fatal attraction is women deep the troubled woman but somebody described the other day fatal attraction is being amongst a movie like Jules\nWow scared people as much as jobs I think wow me in a shot [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat's funny do you think that movie I was watching the other night the thinking it might have a kind of Second Life when we're living in an age of righteous female and\nIt would be wonderful to tell the exact story from her point of view because there's so much about her there wasn't clear that wasn't that you know it was left to people's imagination and I think it ... it would be\nFascinating so nobody take that idea from [laughter] [noise] well\nNearly ... million people listening may well Glenn size the wife is out now my guest in the ... today a or that and say

writers in the past and maybe I Need writers to be on a pedestal and if their contemporaries somehow I'm not able to put them on the same pedestal that said nothing is absolute like he's sort of talking about there's no black and white so I sometimes do read contemporary books and sometimes I Do watch\nContemporary television for the most part I don't watch much t._v. are still mostly the

yeah so what about you in terms of music presumably because music as you ... do you listen to music jazz music on when you were trying to do things [noise]\nUm yeah I find it difficult have music in

Hammond is the present of health check on the BBC will set us\nSo we found that forty percent of the people in the age groups that that they often will very often felt lonely and then gradually as people get older that number went down but still over Seventy five twenty seven percent for saying that they are always often felt lonely\nNow of course these figures are quite high and it's partly it was it was on line two people could decide themselves whether to take part so that might it might have made them a bit higher of rule but I think what is really striking is these differences between the age groups\nSo that people were telling us that they felt disconnected that they felt left out\nI'm On that they didn't feel\nComfortable in that neighborhood necessarily that they there wasn't somebody they could um you know borrow a little bit of money from in the streets in an emergency if they needed to\nWhy is that is it because older people are more resilient to worries about loneliness\nI think that's a really good point I think one of the things is that we know that when you're very young it is a time when people feel their motions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness\nAnd older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that ... people who are older to look back and we all them when they were they ... they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it's something about ... life I think this may ways of being the case it was just never measured before it may be used as a time when you feel more lonely and that's\nInteresting is going to ask about social media but you said older people have felt lonely and when they were younger but Britain is the lonely loneliness capital of your why is that what did they tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas then there'll be make eye contact and that in itself can be quite low in the right\nYeah so we did all the the ... if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the world type pause\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and and from from the U.S has kind of comfortable uh levels of letting us and India there was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe is a place that would very much be the case and they had higher levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent it's not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister added to see I told you set out tons to levy aid loneliness and social isolation with wanting that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with us which is what you were pointing to him being independent how'd you sold this though what's the strategy\nWell we off people ... solutions they founded what for them and of course with a song plus because this to find out what is actually what for people for people they know that it's it's amazing\nUm number one was finding distracting activities or oh dedicating your time to work or study all hope is max was joining a social club that also came a list of most um helpful suggestions that people make so it's not for everybody\nI'm changing your thinking to make it more positive to to look I'm On the bright side of things of obviously sometimes are easier said than done\nAnd I I thought was interesting that you're starting a conversation with anyone because it hasn't got to be deep meaningful long conversations that people have that can alleviate loneliness chanting somebody when you buy your paper in the shuffle or your milk ... or whatever those little things remind us we connect to everybody else in the real human number one in the same well\nAnd you can listen to the full results of that survey on loneliness on the health check program BBC will say this this Wednesday at twenty feet GMT\nNow a referendum in Macedonia

called ethic country tries to recover from the worst flooding Japan has seen in decades\nNow wonderfully analyses is this map of where have we seen records through the last several months and you can watch the heat waves as they move across the U.S and then sometimes at the same time sometimes at different times used to heat waves in the u._k. and Scandinavia in\nParticular which saw all time record highs and you also see heat waves that march with the weather patterns across Asia and you know go from almost all the way from Europe to like Japan and some of these things are happening at the same time and some of them are displaced a little bit of time but\nBasically most of the northern hemisphere was affected by heat waves at some point this summer\nMy own experience if this dramatic some it was the prolonged heat wave in the u._k. which reminded me of the previous record some weight back in Nineteen Seventy six when he was taking exams of school twenty Eighteen just squeaked into the record books on some counts for\nEngland not the case a whole we ended up having the hottest summer on record the u._k. as a whole basically tied with some of the previous years\nBut it was a very substantial heat wave and the you know if you look at not the summer as a whole but individual days there were times where you had station studying all time records I did that gets a little repetitious that we look at you know it's hot it's still hot and it's going to get hotter\nAnd you know using compared to previous years so for example back in Nineteen Seventy six when the u._k. was having a major heat wave and the u._k. summer that was similar to the u._k. summer this year\nBut in that year it was only the u._k. there was having this major heat event whereas this year with the heat events you know spread\nAll across the world and those broad swath of heat\nAre you know why the concerning factors of global warming and I guess\nFor the u._k. I'll have to wait for four years to see that ... broken boats on the other hand there have been quite a lot of hot summers in the past decade and probably won't have to wait another forty years for it to be broken again\nIn fact at the rate we're going by twenty fifty or so you would expect about half the year is to be as warm as this year\nNumbers of climate scientists that digging into these weather data to understand better the impacts of global warming among them Oxford University Freddie also a ...\nA member of the world where the attribution project which is already analyzed the European heat wave\n... interesting thing about global more at an all\nWe have this thing pass them all in all in Europe and Asia and then\nThat's still very and I I'm not at all during the summer weather\nAnd it was so widespread as well it was a stationary I looked at all and Europe at this way I think it's also interesting that at the same time\nWill weigh in on a chair so that we're all waiting to pattern that way anyway in North America has a long tail or\nAre they so it's not the same way it was a long way and of course is the whole life but I think that's the biggest difference between for example the ... thanks whether that will make heat wave aware\nThat we're no heat wave that we're at now than Europe and that way that we can get in a while then Europe including people that were also a heat wave shorter one at different times over the summer and the rest of the northern hemisphere and I think that's well that's kind of what we ask\nWell maybe that I Am\nThe hottest year on record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all kinds of remarkable weather event this year started out with a ... La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be ...\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all about so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shops across tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual averages a fu ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann that makes that these global average is Ernie parts of the climate story and not the pop the masses to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road on when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time honored television screens it in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nOf course you know write that one and then kill one and it's not necessarily harming our common what can I say the reason why we do ... any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's\nRight to say this is something different or something that then you can be\nQuite rare and it's now a relatively common and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nSince last place I Want to look is the region why climate change is having the solstice effect\nIn the Arctic it too has been affected by the unusual whether it's twenty Eighteen affect the impact that were parents first says Lacey always just Judy ... from the U.S national snow and ice data center\nWell we had record Los yes conditions over the winter and we look at you know if you look at our temperatures over the winter\nCertainly December was I think the one that we've recorded in January February or maybe the second warmest months out of the winters since Nineteen eighty so I mean definitely we had very unusual winter conditions and these winter warm temperatures are starting to impact the ice growth\nMeans bits of seems math to me that this is it gets warm when the sun's shining the main thing about the ... the shining the north pole on December the twenty second\nRight but what we have seen happening and then eventually the last um three winters as we're having these storms that are tracking up into the Arctic bringing warm moist air so in the wintertime if you have ... coming up to the Arctic they're actually going to bring in warm moist air that can help ... the surface even in the middle of winter\nUm whereas in the summertime if you have a cycling coming in usually that's associate with cooler conditions you're blocking sunlight and maybe you would have less the ice melt so the cycle or different depending on what time of year the coming into the Arctic\nAnd and one thing we have noticed I mean we don't necessarily see a change in cycling frequency in the wintertime necessarily with the ice loss right now but we are seeing maybe an increase frequency of extreme cycle and\nAnd they're starting to track further north so the ice age and winter's pushing for North any cycling actually tracking it further than they used to which can impact the sea ice especially like in the carrying the banner and see where they usually come in in the wintertime\nDespite not very ... start the Arctic ice has not melted as far as this summer as it did in twenty twelve the wet a big regional storm push to ... to the current record\nIn part that's because the flip side of those heat waves in the Americas Europe in Siberia who's being a cold ... system was over the north pole but that's little comfort to Judy and ... says the strong decline in Arctic ice is still in evidence for him the trend ... since the exceptional yeah twenty seven\nI Would say that this summer circulation patterns we hadn't seen thousands seven\nIf that happened today we would have a new record low because it was a very unusual summer as well not in terms of a big storm coming in and you had this high pressure that persisted over the Beaufort Sea all summer long and under high pressure you tend to have clear skies you have a lot of solar radiation hitting the ice\nThat that was that high pressure was coupled with low pressure over Siberia for example\nAnd so what that that has created a very strong pressure gradient between the high and low pressure centers which brought warm winds from the south into the Arctic Sea funneled all this warm went into the Arctic you also push the ice away from the coast of Siberia and Alaska towards the north pole and you help flush more ice at a friend's straight so all of those things happened\nAnd that was able to cause at first to record low that we saw in two thousand seven which also took scientist by surprise because we didn't think he could lose that much ice that quickly\nAnd it did show that the ice has become quite vulnerable to these unusual atmospheric patterns because he ISIS than enough now that if you have\nA very strong circulation pattern that sets up that will favor ice melt you going to lose a lot of ice very quickly if you have a storm come in and depending on the time of year that it comes in and where it comes in because you have a vulnerable ice pack because it's then it can create a lot of damage\nAnd so what's happened in the Arctic is if the weather is benign you're still going to have less yes but it won't be as dramatic\nBut if you have a dramatic weather pattern that comes in you're going to lose a lot of ice very quickly and I think that's what we're seeing is just that vulnerability has increased for having a dramatic ice loss event\nIt's definitely a matter of when not if so the melting records will be broken\nAnd it was the Arctic because it's the rapidly changing conditions that many scientists suspect artist stapling whether far away I'll be talking about back in next week's edition of discovery was the b._b._c. and those pushing the view include climatologist Michael Mann\nWho says we should smart enough to the connection between global warming and changing whether\nGlobal warming doesn't cause a meteor logical event to happen\nWhat it does is it could take that event and it can intensified in various ways\nHurricanes can become stronger they can carry more moisture with them and deal more flooding potential and or even these mid latitude storm systems can be much greater\nFlooding threats in these high pressure centers in the summer are becoming deeper and hotter and that's where we are seeing record breaking heat and drought and wildfires break out so it's intensifying these weather systems in a way\nThat is doing great damage and it's a relevant to ask did climate change\nYou know caused this storm to form it's a question we can never really answered the better question is once this storm began to form was it intensified by climate change\nAnd we now have great confidence that in many ways the answer is yes\nThis is Colorado Public\nRadio news hurt on Ninety point one F.

told the BBC's dominant Laurie ah earlier today that this came as a great relief to say much trade disruption of light\nIt appears that we hadn't seen some concessions on really three key contentious issue that was really sticking points in the agreement so one is around the dairy system in Canada and to supply management is quite a protected industry so we are seeing that that will be open somewhat to the to other markets like the U.S and Mexico\nBut as well when we look at that speed settlement mechanism that is still going to remain in place which was something that Kennedy had pushed

favorable for for all parties involved as you say\nWell so dramatic wasn't it was sort of ... sort of not just in the last few hours before the midnight deadline of last night with with trade ministers flying around the place or do you think there is a bit of a template there for for what might happen between the U.S and China the much bigger trade well which is looming\nWell I think it is positive for risk sentiment I Would say that it does signal the fact that we could see more conciliatory tone between the U.S and China emerge but I Would say that's more of a medium term issue and really near term it's going to continue to further escalation but they're trying to get on those two parties\nKnow recoup a talking to them and take a call while as indicated President Trump's trade war with China\nDoes show no sign of slowing down of the night last we introduced fresh Paris on two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports joining return is added sixty billion\nDollars all

state owned Chinese companies\nI'm joined now in the studio by a George magnets he's a former chief economist UPS he's got a new book red flags white Chinese why she's China is under threat\nChina um George is a big theme in today's program first off do you see any reason for optimism here that the north American deal might pave the way for Trans Pacific they told\nA no not really because I think the um the discussions which the United states has been having with Mexico and Canada um are really about the terms under which the country's trade with one another [noise]\nThe terrorists over turf war the trade war that's going on between America and China is a ... about the terms of trade but actually underneath it's really much more existential it's about uh the struggle for technological leadership\nOr for millet treat dominance and about the rules and regulations governing accepted rules and regulations governing industrial policy intellectual property and so on as you indicated just now and as such I think\nThis is going to go on for quite some time I mean Jack Ma recently founder of Ali Baba uh recently said he felt betrayed well would go on for Twenty years I don't know about that but it's very difficult to see an off ramp up at the moment\nHow um how are they affecting China's economy do we know yet too early to say\nYeah well I mean it is beginning to clip 'em up the ... the the Chinese economy um be a very closely watched series of business sentiment indicators for September or who just came out actually before we were all now\nI'm On the indicated that the economy how we can through September we export sector of the economy was beginning to um contracts actually at the margin\nOr so I'm obviously it's not the biggest thing in China because China is not really kind of a such a trade dependent economy anymore but it's it's big has a lot of\nInfluence over your employment and uh uh conditions for companies particularly in the coastal areas\nYes and we do know that we already that China's internal cause human to mom was decreasing that has been a chilling effect in recent years on on on China's own economies that have been precious they're ready for president she\nYes I'm I'm I think the reason for that just because of the beginning of two thousand Seventeen\nUm China embarked on this I'm a sort of crackdown on finance to try to um a kind of limited aid but certainly climbed down on the most egregious forms of risk taking and financial malpractice and this means quite successful in some respects\nOr in the sense that um you know leverage in the economy borrowing a bad behavior by a by banks and financial companies actually has been a child and so the consequence of that country has being weakening economic growth and and uh weakening investment\nWe're going to come back to all of that in just a moment George stay with us or\nChina has general worries of course one of them is this debt problem and it's often brought about which seems to have been the result of massive infrastructure projects that have been going on all over the country this time last year I visited one of them showing and it's a massive new\nCity that's

I think for most people this will be a new name\n[noise] it's a new name for a lot of us as well focusing on your on a lot of the separatist groups don't do not have much back backing from the Iranian people and there are at least half a dozen of them that exists now a there was even is it is a national confusion about which off of the group it was\nBut I've been speaking of David ... who is Canadian but he's also professor of international economic law at City University here in London one area of dispute involved the importation of cars so ... professor Collins what's changed in that area\nSeems to happen in this new negotiated agreement is that the Americans have put a coach\nOn the volume of cars which Canada can't export to the U.S without being subjected to a potential of drug car specific tariffs\nAnd faithfully that quota seems to be significantly beyond what candidate currently exports to the u._s. so I'm not concerned that that's going to be particularly relevant at least in the short term\nOn the other hand the access that the U.S farmers will have to the dairy market that was something that Kennedy was resistant to agreeing so what's been settled there\nWhile the U.S is going to have access to increase it free point five percent of candidates dairy market which doesn't seem like much but it is significant and I'm delighted at this development you're absolutely right it was a concession on that part of Canada it was something that candidate didn't want to give up but they should have given it up\nThere's no need for that dairy sector to have been protected in Canada for as long as it was and I think that's an actual achievement on under the new agreement you you can describe it as a win for the U.S and it is but I think in the long term it ... it will be a win for Canadians as well\nBut it does mean doesn't it that the price of dairy products is likely to go down to consumers I guess that's why you think it's a good deal\nYes I think it's a fantastic deal I'm from Canada and I can tell you that she is in milk products are very expensive there is no need for them to be as expensive as they were you come to Europe and you realize there's all these amazing\nDairy products that are too expensive now ordinary people will be able to enjoy a range of\nCheeses and ... and various other products ice cream and so on a normal prices this was
