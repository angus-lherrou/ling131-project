us more about the situation in Portland\nBut I think there are two reasons festival it hangs out and very inaccessible areas are ... and that's quite how to attack and drive out\nSecond is the local

government to really do anything about it is relatively restricted so I think everybody reckons well okay it's not so much of a threat that we need to divert resources to deal with\nYou seem to be suggesting that it's a sort of a plan based affiliation rather than anything else is there anything about the ideology that means that it can appeal to a particular group all differentiated cells for example from the Ames and methods of Shabaab\nIs I think you're quite right I think the only way that it can really thrive as by managing to be different from al Shabaab is a bit too similar to al Shabaab at the moment\nAnd it has to break out from that sort of structure social structures that exist in Somalia in order to be able to attract recruits from elsewhere it has managed to do that for a little bit and it has had one or two people returning from Iraq Syria for example\nJoined its ranks and if it manages to do that successfully then it could present a real threat not justice money to other countries beyond\nUm what does it need to do however I mean surely it's USPA has been rather exploded and damaged by the end of the so called ... so how does it then advertise itself what does it end point you know ... what is the tomorrow that it's promising\nYes indeed well the Islamic state certainly has been decimated and is on its last legs but his propaganda or if it still exists on Islamic state in Somalia has managed to tap into that propaganda ref that's kind of get his message out and oil really has to do is to tell people it's there\nAnd that if you can make your way to joined us that's fine you'll be very welcome of course that's easier said than done but uh it's got a little bit of money not very much it's got some I'm not very good ones\nUm and at the moment it

another place they've already being used during a crisis together health information to and you know the outbreak in Liberia a couple of years ago\nA new study from the New York University College of global public health and NYU tendon school of engineering you text message surveys to determine in real time how people use maternal health services during that outbreak from all I've been speaking to the senior author of the study ...\nYou're in Ebola outbreak like other um emergency situation and public health it's really important to know how people are using healthcare service it you know can we can be sure they're getting the care that they need\nEspecially in you know I teach nations like they can actually need outbreak settings like Liberia where you know the health care infrastructure in sneak and if they're not using healthcare during an outbreak that can actually of course catalyzed for their health issues\nBut also it kind of a mission I understand it because it could be a lost track or in terms of health care and want to understand why that is a weekend or mitigate on that and it proves to people and get\nA and sending text messages that allows things to be done much quicker than traditional methods\nExactly so you're just looking at new data sort of see how they can complement I think public health sources and of course in Iraq in ... you can get that message in

the right people ... you get in terms of numbers of the people you need to get hold off to cover a broad enough ah sway of a community for\nExample that yeah that's very good question so be it the number is actually not a problem because like you can imagine so many people have mobile phones even in a low means are studying like Liberia urban even girl area of Liberia but they're still the issue because the people who use mobile phone might be of course\nA little bit in front of the people who don't use that and so we had to use our\nNational technique faster to make sure that some and look at some samples from the people that data from from the mobile phone to make sure that makes sense for the you know the larger population\nYeah cause I can imagine in a place like Liberia there's some pretty remote rural places where people either don't have a cell phone network maybe in some cases people who are illiterate maybe some of the people who need the help most are the ones you find the most difficulty and reaching\nNo that's of course they're important especially in these situations so we have to be a kind of puts you in a little bit ... meaning the lenders for example over samples\nIt seemed to where it's more I mean ... and then we had a cat and account characteristics of people not just um one thing we're finding in terms of their health care but you know what there's

complain but Brazilians have mould cause the most\nMore than half of the current crop of congressmen and women for all major parties are under investigation at the moment in connection with some form of corruption and this week to the country's most recent presidents have been further implicated Brazilians say they have had\nIt with corruption and the polls suggest that direct ... votes

politicians here campaigning door to door for a vote the final week of\nGeneral elections in Brazil this kind of a little different about a few of\nOur elected me five thousand people here in Brazil where we took a lot of classes talking about\nSays talking about the system how it works how to be a politician Brazil what is important you know on this election\nIn a kind of those is a punching nine year old engineer reading her first campaign for Congress seat\nShe's talking about her experience with him and all of a bad idea is to set up by business people who want to forge a new generation of leaders\nShouldn't as highly skilled with Colombia an Oxford in her ... in the private sector should be the dream of recruiters but not in Brazilian politics why go into politics in the country that is so corrupt like resume\nEcstatic because it's so corrupt it's very very important for us to be part of the system in order to change as we know that it's a lot of chaos here so that's why we new faces with new projects with new ideas have to be part of this in order to change it and\nWhat do you think you can do differently in the system that ultimately is very corrupt for everyone I Would\nSay that it's very very important to change for electoral system because it only for tax the old politicians I think this must be the focus we had to change that before I before I came to everything out\nThere that are fairly new to talk of the\nPolitical reform the deaths of corruption and visit in politics is astonishing let's take the twenty sixteen impeachment former president ... set for instance you're hearing the Congress section in the back where\nDoes she barely feed you know\nRuling and opposition parties both the ousted and the new president absolutely everyone was involved in graft scandals half of all five hundred and Thirteen Brazilian and peas and Congress are currently under investigation for corruption [noise]\nSo it's not just a few corrupt politicians are parties in Brazil it's a whole system butts rocks in\nWhat we're trying to accomplish here is to change the dynamics of Brazilian politics by bringing new blood with extremely qualified people to a Brazilian politics\nIt's logical fetish spent years working with private equity but last year she got fed up with business as usual it's NGO slash school for politicians cutting off ... teaches people how to fund and run their campaigns specialists are brought in to help people identify unethical pitfalls\nPowder you spots of the good politician the person who is is a good candidate a good fit for your school\nI Would say three major correct or is the first is resilience\nYou have to keep your head up and you know there will be ups and downs second pointers or having like a history of delivering not the history of just talking you know we believe that we need people who you know can roll up does need some get things done and the third\nIs the willingness to serve\nSo we believe that we need to bring that back to the table and so people understand that they when they're voting for someone they're hiring someone to do the job that they can do\nBut even if they're very qualified people it's a very tough systems to get in because there's a lot of corruption and those were corrupt to have a lot of advantages in this so can an honest person make it in this world at least enter politics\nI think they can if you do any research with resume and voters they do essentially give you two answers that they're fed up with the current politicians\nAnd the dude like to see new practices and new individuals and we felt we had to start somewhere\nSo the political renovation which is an aspiration of the president's society as a whole will start in the two thousand and Eighteen election and will most likely continue and will grow over the next few years\nBusiness minded what a referred speaking to the BBC thing again is that\nWell there's a reason corruption in Brazil is so deep seated with the state to huge employer in many parts of the country and the allocation of state contracts in the hands of the few elected officials politicians are in a position to siphon off huge sums if they want to to finance their own reelection campaigns\nCetera mastered the correspondent for the economist magazine and Brazil are seeing this breast self when she visited the town of ... in the country's northeast\nThe in the town of around twenty eight thousand people and the poor northeastern state of ... and basically in the morning I got there I plan to spend the day with the city council and and by nine in the morning he had\nA crowd of people lined up outside it has very poor people with little paper their prescription medicines receipt for\nX rayed and other medical procedure their gas and electricity bills you know there is actually just knowing that there was an election coming up and there was kind of an exchange that went on where he took care of these\nFinancial problems they had to pay their bills with the kind of implicit promise that they would support in in the election and\nThis is a town where the biggest employers the mayor's office you is actually a rival to the counseling in that I was ... and you know across town the mayor's office with distributing these basket\nRiser so people are buying well politicians local politicians are effectively buying votes I guess because they control the mayor's office and in Brazil controlling the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nBut they've got all these savings going on and actually outright the buying as well the going rate was around a hundred hey ice or twenty five dollars\nThen what happens is the mayor of this town basically tries to get all of the people living in this town to vote for the politician that he is in a coalition wet and in this case it's\nA prominent senator and a congressman and depends on land to be able to get federal money to do projects and activities and hand out and then higher\nThey depend on all of these small scale there to get the votes that are needed to keep sort of re electing a lot of them have half a dozen corruption cases\nYes and of course nowhere probably in the world has as many corruption cases\nSeems well has done over the last five or six years of Brazil has one of the national political level the anti corruption agenda has defined the last part of this national election though isn't it\nHas indeed and whoever is elected president is going to have a really tough time getting rid of corruption because there's a whole ... that breed that and that starts in these little towns and then worked its way up and I think you need to\nUnderstand about Brazil is Brazil has massive electoral districts so everyone in al ago as are voting for the same legislation than in this case there's four hundred and forty different candidates that they're going to have to choose between for various positions and that kind of huge\nArray of candidates combined with thirty five political parties\nMeans that elections are really expensive so there's a need for money in some cases from legitimate places and in other cases as the corruption investigations have shown over the past few years it comes from outright graft\nIt seems almost impossible to anyone and to keep yourself playing\nSome of the politicians who have and a raft and nice corruption scandals say the system itself that require that I\nThink that's a bit of a cop out there have been movements to make elections cheaper\nTo reduce the number of parties and huge band corporate donations but what's really difficult to all of these reforms one that disgusting Congress they encounter massive resistance from the politicians because of course that quite like this and that kept them in power for so many years\nAnd it's really hard for a reform minded congressman or president as I think we'll see when we're watching it over to really change the way that\nPolitics work and the role of money in politics and develop\nSarah messing up the economist magazine so it will be elections change and the thing the success of the official carwash will love ... investigation is thrown open the extent of the corruption problem\nBy Nineteen Seventy four ... to books have been struggling with the problem for five years Yellen says

we would try courage and membranes and we did and this is where we found out something that told us that we're doing something very wrong what happened was that when his courage and membranes\nWere placed on the animals the wounds just refused to close\nSomehow these membranes of college and appear to be slowing down the speed at which the wound healed when he's collaborated up to the page he

kind of a tissue here it doesn't look like scar but I don't know what else it is\nHe looks to some mash covers said this looks like during this we looked at it again and again and then ask other people and they confirmed that the ... we thought we had the failed to experiment in our hands and that's you know we didn't we had that very successful experiment\nSo it was like yo eureka moment that uh it was a moment or right yes but it was a eureka moment was not shared by the majority of my colleagues in the area of medicine or biology it took a long time many years\nTo convince people

the knitting scan on either side slowly in things they get into the artificial college and they break it down and they replaced it with natural college in reducing scarring off the bat that\nIt wasn't
