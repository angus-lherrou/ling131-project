the slave history of this country and when she read that in the Bible it was a huge turnout for her that the vitals she'd been taught to believe said that slave should it be their masters\n... increasingly driven away from Christianity\nFirst I strayed completely away from religion at all but later on I started to feel like I still believed in God so that led me to the nation of Islam\nThe nation of Islam was moving from good in the United states in Nineteen thirty which sole Christianity religion for white or black Americans to follow Islam\nAt that point I knew nothing about [noise] orthodox Islam or anything like that I just wanted to find God and I knew about the nation they were familiar and so I sort of went that direction\nOf all those folks are done six it was something else closer to home that point you to talk to a nation of Islam\nI think we are issue which you know I'm not really addressed fully disavowed rich you didn't look black\nWhen I Do need it for that

unwilling to compliment from a stranger was the catalyst for longer taking another significant step towards becoming a Muslim\nAt that moment even though I wasn't wearing full he job I was trying to dress modestly and so when the person said to me I think it was like you know you look good or something like that I was so offended\nAnd I just immediately took that as a sign that I needed to cover and so I went home I open the car on and it open to the chapter on the job\nRight on the same right page and I read the verse Henry before but this time when I read it almost felt like God was telling me that this is for you and it just basically says you know for men and women to lower their gays in the address my sleep\nAnd I got this guy was being directly to me at that moment I went in my closet and I found it really ... loose shirt and I went to my mom's closet and she had these really two maybe three really ugly seventies style scarves [laughter]\nThat's used there were over her

of heroes\nI remember you get on the school bus and nobody would want to sit next to you because you're black or my dad would take us in the mountains for a picnic and we get out of her car with other

I'm comfortable on my own skin\nThen my daughter puts on his job and I can't go anywhere with or without getting the same glances looks and I remember thinking I already did this I don't want to do this again and so I resented it\nMeanwhile the donor was becoming uncomfortable nope with Islam far from it but with what she felt was racism of a different kind of the nation of Islam I'm Still trying to block superiority of the white people\nDidn't understand how a group could believe in God but also believe negatively about certain people based on their skin color and also because I was still light skinned as an African American I felt like it was almost like self hatred for me to feel hatred toward the white race for what happened in America\nAnd so at that moment I got a big trash bag and I do all of my nation of Islam stuff in there and posters read books and I only kept my car on and my Bible\nAnd I went to the dumpster and I came back to my dorm room and then I just picked up the phone and called mom and said mom and decided to become a Muslim\nThe morning she called me\nI\nThank you for calling and then I ask her how our car was running after fighting with them on for

debates around um immigration particularly around the the migrant um boat\nSort of kept seizing across the Mediterranean um but it'll be interesting to see how you know leaders in Italy respond to this given that there is a direct tension between um you know\nSocial services for Italian citizens and those who may not necessarily be um citizens of the country but\nI think in terms of austerity I find that when I was scared he measures are at the forefront of these debates migrants tend to be the the scapegoats um instead of you know leaders responding to the needs of their domestic citizens

about the books and they say well why are you focusing on children\nUm they can't change policy and yes precisely but children have the capacity to change practice and for me sometimes changing practice\nUm is more important than changing sort of the high level policies because quite often there's lots of policies and regulations on the books about how to enforce anti corruption I'm I'm actions but ah those are ultimately an uninformed\nUm and so if we can change the value systems across the globe about what it is that we actually valued devalue honesty to be value integrity between value\nUm you know people living lives that are that are accountable then perhaps we can enforce those policies much more meaningfully and so that's what the intention of the book is oh it's great to see that you guys are now targeting I'm Eighteen to thirty five year olds which is an important demographic\nI'm In the scourge against corruption\n[noise] for instance ... is a need to be\nUnfair to expect young people to fly the flag of anti corruption when the grown ups of set up a world where they either blend in all ...\n[noise] yeah but you know corruption is a major threat to the CIA people as well and their development in terms of access to education and employment for example and many other people are forced to pay bribes in order to get ahead so\nI think it's really all about a change in attitude that's why it's so important to educate young people are very early stage so that they can learn that corruption does not have to be the norm\nThey can learn about their rights and see how much better society is without corruption\nAnd and only that it can be really build a movement of young people who challenged corruption and even resisted and not become part of the system that grown ups have battled for them and it is easy to feel powerless as an individual against the system\nAnd and that's why also with the future I guess corruption awards we want and the winner is to have the chance to work directly with our local offices in their country to support them with implementing their idea\nWhat kind of young people to\n[noise] I mean you know if young people maintain the status quo there will be no change and young people especially a more open to social change they use modern ways of communication to connect with each other\nAnd they're at tech savvy so there's a lot of potential and that and I think it's really about empowering them and giving them a role in the fight against corruption and it's really about you know trying and and of course there is an option but complacency and indifferent or not\nThat's bringing Casey Kelso Casey you run Transparency International policy and advocacy to now are still there was a corruption is on the rise what do you say\n[noise] Ah yes I think we see a starting by your decade or more ago that crushing globalized so instead of\nJust petty corruption and there's a grand corruption system or a criminal service industry that of all with\nAccountants and lawyers people who set up a show companies\nAnd these huge dirty clothes have gotten larger and larger which means that a lot of defines get larger and larger and there's no football policemen there's no there's no natural enemy of these quick ... financial flows that go from London to Africa or back and forth worth or Singapore\nPanama there's a lot of money sloshing around up there\nYou were talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale is isn't just bribing a local official you're talking about really big sums of money and really big organizations\nYeah that um I Know well I'm a writer Arthur in ... I can talk about for the local level which is extremely important\nAt the global level we're also trying to look at how do you make sure there are banks for for a lawyer just don't get caught up in these huge amounts plenty billions of dollars that go into ...\nD you taste laundering or into a binding contract so one of the biggest of their schemes was in Latin America ... billion\nWere spent fortunes\nRopes audio you wanted to come in here yeah\nI mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples out because I mean although Transparency International has a corruption the perception index with with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nI'm a United Nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at illicit financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've gotten billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through\nYou know invading taxes through transfer pricing I'm mostly from point foreign multinationals and you have you know the the wiki leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence base if more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be Transparency International should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption in Africa or the other the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that Iraq sorry I did meet John it you\nKnow I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days has been one of the series of high profile arrest this time ... away who was heading into pole and they seem to being picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAnd innocence what China's been doing particularly in the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national see position commission is what you might call auntie transparency there's this huge crackdown but it's very much the product\nOf north ... state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and just basically putting the frightened there's a large numbers of wealth people looked just officials for movie stars even the famous Chinese movie star who was\nA hidden away for three months until she came out in the great packs us tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very author Terry and kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go to\nCasey well from my site or I I think in part to our atmosphere Casey visit earned about ... can you hear me just try again yeah\nOur embassy international called ... that the national supervision medicine the systematic threat to human rights and China which we agree with that ...\nPeople without trial without access to a lawyer for six months or having an organization that you can't appeal for either to the Supreme Court is probably not the way to go first if you want to kind of your hands I'm\nSorry I think ... little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I I I was a question for all of you um and in fact rubbed do\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of the United states the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world does it work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or less the financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parent beyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe\nFor being free of loving wherever I Want to and a free sex before marriage that was with the pope was against\nColombia and author and journalist Hector Abad speaking to me that about his latest book the farm listening to that rubbed ... round Robin tell I saw you lost particularly when a hectare mentioned politicians\nYeah he's a politicians don't read I mean my first response was that was perhaps politicians need to read novels more to be better politicians and to be more humane and their policies\nUm that's the beauty of of literature and the beauty of people who can create a campus of characters that really bring the human condition to the fore and\nListening to him talk just made me so so enthused and excited but again I I I think my response about politicians not meeting is that they do need to read more and they need to read novels so that they can become more humane in their policy making Rona\nSome politicians do read we should remember that President Obama actually was a great novel reader and there's a wonderful conversation stood on line up with him talking to the ... surprised when the Maryland Robin send about ... novels in fact\nThe situation that the president being the into the or the novelist thing the interviewee but it's also something about land that's very contemporary in China too\nMany peasants being moved off the land there to the cities and one of the major reasons they don't want to go in many cases if they lose their right to have that little patch of land that they had that in the countryside\nAnd for Chinese workers it's still birth rate there to the hall it's rather like Colombians it seems to have some patch of land that's really the\nRub job Islam's this land issue is universal isn't it\nIt is absolutely I mean I'm across the continent of Africa where you have a large multinational corporations taking over large fleets of land and communities being very very up in arms about that and trying to hold their governments accountable\nUm is a testament to the fact that land as culture land is um is everything about who you are as a human being um and the the the tendency to to sort of negate that is really problematic\nAnd everyone now moving to the ... and even the countryside behind I'm\nOut in the countryside in China one ... is that his grandparents and young children who are left in the villages

thing as bad luck [noise]\nThe reason why we're talking fates food chewed on the position this week is because of a question from listen to the mall so often about the concept is found in many

is it real or is this something that people have\nKind of made up their observed things or is there some science behind it I think people lie is when someone for example looks at something nice that you have and or maybe they say something good about it and then the next day that thing that somebody was looking at it something bad happens to it\nFor example let's say some simple things like you buy a car okay and it's beautiful and it's what you want to\nAnd then next thing you know the next day somebody scratches it or we're up to get a nail into Cyrus something like that and it's just I

these kinds of superstitions beliefs and full price that's just a part of something noticed magical thinking\nThat's we'll find out in this program nearly all of us even the most rational and

a\nQuite a few people walk three that might work\nAround Mosul ground so where what would you do would you underneath all I've done by the [laughter] the jury and right now we can overcome right

that they can't actually have according to the level of cause and effect\nWhich sounds like I said but we had a strike hit with these questions and if you want you to any of these questions and you're thinking my checking my same to the display case there was some ... some questions do you have like a child or\nOf course like jewelry and things like that that people have given me but is it with him

I mean I ... I came into thinking you know I'm a rational amount of time for science degree I noted there are these ... is the real bearing on the real physical world but I actually find it hard to see that either\nI learned you know what else to to send me professor just today we did yes so\nI think like me and I and the princes a couple of them out for a job and your\nBrother yeah\n\nYou with yeah just wonder if you know just to see [noise]\nComfortable with you on on the street on the other thing is similar to wishing adult somebody you're not going to be able to actually change their life and bring him something about just by thinking about it\nBut would you want to it so easy for me to just ... to the un rather just to just not\nDo that you don't have to know what I keep thinking that I think\nIt's very common thing Rachel mentioned several emotional\nThing to do and when you do and to not check 'em your least like a little tricky changing something in your house to the basement during it\nThanks to Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the memo for that to mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either\nBut it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though a new Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture so what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nAnd to Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago university's ... school of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or choose to kind of belief come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo quite a broad range of opinions on that\nBut what can science tell us about that\nRichard Wiseman bowling magician and now professor of psychology at University of ... just spent the last of time studying the beliefs and behaviors of lucky unlucky people\nFrom out research around about twelve percent of the population things extremely lucky and about heightened sense that certain you're lucky and most ... somewhere in between but we do have\nA thought when you ask people in their mind how lucky unlucky we are and they start she often you know you can go into schools and children's there'll be able to identify the lucky unlucky kids in the classroom and so this is something which is something to do that psychology is an ass signed keep this notion even though it's a rational or being lucky and I'm like\nIs the idea of luck tied to something that we've been talking about in this program this idea of magical thinking consider yourself lucky Iran lucky is a form\nOf magical thinking because clearly personal fingers ... probably doesn't influence the

I don't think Bloomberg said they should have been turned on I think it was it sort of they they think they go ahead of the curve and the ... before the\nUm the sponsors of whatever it activates there but I think some technical analysis that did look at the evidence removed did put forward\nAnd he said if you were going to do if you if you if you pick the spot on the circuit board the plane but I didn't like that be a great place to do because it it seems that dates or is it flowing across you know from one possible to another so yeah it's feasible and certainly the\nUm there's been warnings from the FBI about supply chain attacks seem very successful ones happen certainly for self on the software like she's but less than the hot but it's certainly one of those things that\nThe bad guys know about and trying to get ... getting to a small change because then used in fact one widely used but the software and it takes care of the distribution for you and you know they can they can be

the ... things and Internet of even more things because the things need to communicate with the other thing that's how it gave now that connectivity is white us for it to be white is unique devices to
