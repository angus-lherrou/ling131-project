fall from them\nOn the national small lead yes that won't be related to the subject of feminine and as it has been ascribed to me I have never ever called myself a feminist I don't really like this what right now than many as ms knows about equality it is about that\nFeelings towards men hatred I don't like this was very much\nBecause of the way it was a distorted it's really been turned upside

but she refuses to be described as a feminist\nTo run again two for two and interestingly enough that social line often echoed by Russian state media this idea that feminism is an evil west an ideology focused on hating men an ideology that he's not compatible with Russian values or\nCulture okay so where does that leave us\nWell we had the allegations that have been made about the video that it was stage that was part of a broader propaganda plan by the crumbling and by the way we did put these points to the Russian embassy here in London they said they don't understand what exactly the video is quote unquote\nPropaganda being okay interesting word but we also had how the people involved in making in spreading these media responded to those allegations again they said sole nonsense and fake news so to get to the bottom of the story\nI think we need to dig a beat the pie attorney will take us to Indiana to meet a Russian\nTroll hunter and we also find out why those Russian trolls developed an interest for stone walls okay NATO force to be with us [noise]\nBetter than after one to ... yes a lot that a lot of other that's Josh Russell you had that testing the

here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV it's sort of what I usually do\nAnd uh at the current moment I'm into hunting down these Russian trolls\nAnd just to be clear he does it's totally free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's Jesse ... thing he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly stirring arguments on line\nAnd his journey began a few years ago in the run up to the last us presidential election\nI felt like I had gotten a lot of misinformation and disinformation online over the course of maybe two or three years leading up to the twenty six team the election and\nI decided to go out and figure out where I got this information from I didn't exactly believe that Russia was messing around on social media when all of the\nMajor news reports came out but one came out that listed the name of an account and what that accounts social media name was\nAnd that meant that I could actually go out and look up information on that account and got me really interested in\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing\nA Josh has a background in programming and I T he understands social media and he knows the mind a patrol because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nInto hashtags on Twitter and are sending out tweets that trick people into thinking on someone else so when there was a a thanks Michelle Obama supposedly high schoolers were sending out this week with pictures of there\nDisgusting looking launches I just randomly looked up bar fun to play and tweeted out with the hashtag thanks Michelle Obama ended it went viral it ended up in a lot of the conservative on line newspapers\nIt was kind of funny because all of my previous week before that were the tweets of obviously not a high schooler\nA room uh\nHaving followed dozens of Russian from all accounts having studied that'd be have yet Josh is in a great position to tell us what information warfare looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see these Russian trolls or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again they're\nGoing to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like a Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it\nAnd as we do provoked very strong feminist an anti feminist responses and some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats photographic images etc\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world the politics oh Mike\nI'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nHow come I self as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a

are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you see never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\n[noise] good questions time plenty to talk about before we take a look at the numbers let's deal with the definition\nOf foreign aid the organization for economic cooperation and development the or we CD created a strict definition of age in the Nineteen sixties they call it a day or official development assistance\nDon't abroad pox is executive director of a day to a research lab of William and Mary University in Virginia and the United states he explains what three conditions needs to be met for aid to classify as a da\nTo be a grant or below market rate loan from a government agency in the donor country the second condition is that it must be focused\nOn the promotion of economic development and welfare in the recipient country and the third condition is that the recipient must be a developing country so military age or any other type of aid that's focused on advancing\nThe donors own national security interests that does not qualify as oh da ... from one developed country to another developed country\nYou know say Germany bailing out in Greece that would not qualify as oh da\n... him all from ... to ... like touring the program now that we've got the foreign aid definition out the way let's take a closer look at the numbers more or less reports at least a male has been busy looking excel spreadsheets\nLizzie let's stop by examining Donald Trump's claim that the U.S is the world's largest give it in the world by fall a foreign aid\nWhen if we look at the fish labor costs numbers then yes he's absolutely right\nThose numbers and made available by the CDC development assistance committee that's an international farm twenty nine countries including many of the largest provider is not the u._s. UK Germany Japan and front I took a look at the numbers the two thousand and Seventeen\nAnd the U.S provided more than thirty five billion dollars in aid Gemini second with twenty five million dollars and he said was Eighteen billion dollars\nOr not might not come as a big surprise given those countries have some of the world's largest economies\nAgreed and there aren't any bill surprises when you look at the countries at the Boston with less Eva Iceland Slovenia and says I Can't make up the Boston St intensive touches amount given by the ISI the Memphis and none of ... in the ... not just to kind of nice\nNow are listening Lydia ... what the foreign aid per capita was a better way to measure how generous of the country is\nRight this is why you divide the total amount to countries give by its population\nAnd when I did that picture changed completely the United states gets roughly a hundred and eight dollars a pop passing\nWhich places seventeenth on that list of the twenty nine countries have accurate tasteful the Scandinavian countries do particularly well no way leads the way with seven hundred and eighty dollars a person and Sweden Denmark upset and full ... five hundred and fifty dollars and four hundred dollars for actively\nHim while the Scandinavian countries contributing so much\nWell let me take you back to Nineteen Seventy\nWhen the United nations tickets suggestion from a commission they look to the future development assistance it per ... countries get no point seven percent effect gross national income to fish would development assistance by Nineteen eighty ... and they test in two thousand Seventeen only five of the twenty nine obesity countries met\nAt no point some sent target they was Sweden Noxon that newly them up and the United kingdom the average across what would I be CD countries with no point three accent\nAnd the United states was ranked twenty second giving no point one eight percent of gross national income\nNow if the United states wanted to get no point in some sense it would need to find an additional ... billion dollars on top of the thirty five billion dollars it already getting\n... so that's the day so when we look at twenty nine countries that report aid spending to the er we CD but what about the ones that don't some more secretive than others won't in particular has brought pox against\nChina is a particularly opaque donor and wonder it has opted out of international recording systems such as the city's creditor reporting system and the international in transparency initiative and in fact Beijing considers the details of its overseas development program to be a state secret\n... didn't put fried I'm his team also\nWe've developed an open source method of data collection that provides very detailed financial operational location all information about Chinese government financed\nProjects all around the globe coming from four different places from English Chinese on local language news reports from documents that Chinese ministries embassies\nAnd economic and commercial ... offices put it in the public domain from the aid and debt information management systems of China's counterpart countries so think of the finance and planning ministries that are on the receiving end\nThese incoming money and then finally there's a large body of she's studying field research where people are studying individual Chinese government sponsored activities so we developed this very in depth methodology to synthesize all this information into a database of about forty four hundred\nChinese government financed projects than a hundred and thirty eight countries around the world\nSo to the numbers show in terms of what China is spending it tastes also all the world's second largest economy\nOf the major findings that emerges as the vast majority of the funding from the Chinese government does not qualify as for made in the strict sense of the term Seventy seven percent of the funding does not qualify as are the eye and over a Fifteen year period for which we have reliable data\nTwo thousand two thousand fourteen\nChina spent roughly five and a half billion dollars a year on the o da and by comparison to us provided at least twenty five billion dollars of OJ each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a foreign aid the U.S outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the d._a. is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly ... fifty percent bigger than China's so for us to be outspending China all over the a by five hundred percent suggest a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows\nChina in the U.S look a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two dozen fourteen the U.S government spent roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time\nSo if you brought in the aperture and use that broader definition of aid China spends about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year and the U.S spends about twenty six billion dollars a year\nTrying to get lots of aid money to Africa and spent particularly heavily on infrastructure projects across energy transport and communications\nBecause most of these projects that commercial that don't count tools or da\n... trying to accomplish a number it's around four dollars per person for OJ Seventeen dollars per person when all of the money is ... and remember that the equivalent us number is a hundred and eight dollars per person brought pox pointed out to me the bulls oh China is a global economic superpower\nStill has a huge number of people living in poverty\nSo politically giving overseas aid is difficult on mice explain why the Chinese government is so uptight about what you have to [noise]\nBeen costs are reporting [noise]\nAnd now ... asks why women increasingly turning to wellness\nWelcome everyone [noise] this sounds

you\nWhen I saw it as as a as a break 'cause I'm a normal break\nSo so just to give you an idea when we first started this prices last\nYear we the very first run that we had we achieved the same

then also allowing the bacteria to a point where you calling for longer\nWith zero heat\nWith Sarah heat so oil at room temperature so that any ... any energy way require is the pumping it right on

no no no no it's still very early but um I have to say that we went the first people to come up with the idea of making bricks using your rear so that's actually what we take from the urine is we off
