{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "As with anything Eleanor you have to wonder where she found the time to be a regular magazine columnist in addition to among other things writing her syndicated newspaper column called my day\nHolding weekly White House press conferences traveling around the country on behalf of new deal programs and answering some estimated one hundred and thirty thousand letters a year as first lady\nThe America that emerges through this Twenty years sampling of Eleanor is advice column is it once familiar and very long gone\nWe're still wrestling of course with arguments over civil liberties national health care the electoral college and institutionalized racism and sexism Eleanor gamely weighed in on those hot button topics\nBut then there are a whole slew of other letters here that come out of an America so earnest it almost seems like the product of a work of speculative fiction\nImagine being a young woman in Nineteen forty nine and feeling that it was okay to write to Eleanor Roosevelt to asked two girls who refused to neck ever get married\nOr the Nineteen year old boy in Nineteen forty six who's already a veteran of World War two who asks Eleanor if he's too young to marry his sweetheart\nEleanor uncharacteristically waffle on that one\nAlthough she was by nature and upbringing emotionally reticent Eleanor sometimes

heart out about mistake she made bringing up her oldest boy\nShe thinks you are in great woman Mrs Roosevelt and I wish you could tell her a few mistakes you think you made when your children were

tradition it was a serious mistake on my part\nI did too little for my three older children personally when they were babies\nAs trivial a cultural artifact as an advice column may seem to be Eleanor is if you ask me columns reveal multitudes about the extraordinary relationship she forged with her fellow Americans of all races young and old\nThere's something very democratic about this twenty plus year monthly conversation of sorts that Eleanor conducted on the pages of popular women's magazines people felt they had a right to contact Eleanor and she felt she had a responsibility to respond\nAnd all those seriousness was her hallmark as an advice columnist I also get the feeling that writing these columns and consequently being more connected to the lives of everyday Americans gave Eleanor great joy\nMarine Corps again teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed if you ask me essential advice from Eleanor Roosevelt edited by Mary Jo banker\nTomorrow in fresh

mineral the forums when the common minerals or con get squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact it's very rare\nAnd walk to social impacts are we talking about you\n[noise] well read I can form out a couple of different sizes impacts but the site we founded in Western Australia near sharks they along the coast\nOr is one of the big ones that puts it in a rare class and part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about its sides\nAre discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that that doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in our history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to a math is what you have a a beat up just average\nYeah here the uncertainty behind us and why it hasn't and discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the season plants just started to colonize lamp\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried and then when we want to study it today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts in cause dramatic changes\nUh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called would lay we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's a big event\nLast night just off the air

Israel economic society thinks the reason that economists dropped the ball was that there is some ... load\nIt's not easy to have a really slick pat on sets up why they didn't see it coming but one way of looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAnd asking whether they were found on not tend to look at them one by one and what we know that financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into was even way so they build\nModels not where one dumbing down notes down enough of them now they build models actually with that if that wasn't bad [noise]\nWatch these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest rates unemployment\n[noise]\nOriginally there were actual mechanical model is still one on display New Zealand that uses water to demonstrate how money would flow around the economy as computing power has grown so to as the complexity of the models which uh Columbus tried to capture\nThe key relationships in a sense of clever equations [noise] what professor and experiencing the models economists were using to predict the\nFuture assumed that if one bank failed it would bounce back in most effect others but why would prevailing models assume that it crushed couldn't happen when economists note that economic crushes occurred was disturbing regularity\nPolitics that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous\nWas because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great moderation and what that meant was the boom in the past didn't seem to be with us sent me this is rolling along in a chair for way down the river a reasonable state and things are going OK\nPoliticians believed to reassuring people that they finally found a way to keep prosperity going forever here's the venue ... big circa Gordon Brown speaking in two thousand seven\n[noise] we will not return to the old boom and bust [noise]\nEconomists so happy to blame the models they made for being inadequate but is this enough was the deeper problem with economics the bank of England's chief economist and they held and has no doubt that economists were in deep trouble\nI think we should take some of the black as an economist at someone is what my whole life and economics truth be told\nOur coast model of how the economy function of how I should just send 'em that will cost models fail at the first offense in the crisis it could not make sense of what was happening around us\nSo of course that was the same thing we can and we should have happened after the Nineteen seventies\nGo back and reform written branch seems crazy now to think we somehow lost sight of the importance of finance and money in banking and explaining the big ... and the economy\n[noise]\nBut it wasn't the economists who worked full well the discipline of economics at so [noise]\nMy own view is that it's not an economics but the economists have come to dominate the discipline that having a helpful obsession with perfect markets ignoring the parts of economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes incredibly these high priests of the new economics\nSimply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental\nI mean we could lose and which one forensic to market economy [noise]\nBilling bouncer the former chief economist is one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were captivated by new fashions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody shows coming sheen to a crisis coming not doing that I I don't feel particularly bad about not seeing it's coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either\nBut my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the rise meds once that disease has been diagnosed but much of the fashionable economics of the Iraq has absolutely nothing to say about how to handle the crisis\nIt to go far too long to diagnose disease and responses appropriately there was a school of economics and that can you tell us how to handle the crisis that was old fashioned getting in economics and a number of people made that point but then people recommended fiscal stimulus\nIn the face off a deep recession they weren't using frontier economics with a guy that gets stores and graduate schools\nThey are using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get them through the surgeries that rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in close ... there were seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crashing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become Wendy colon is most of widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way that curriculum excess taught in universities around the world and has that changed\nIt has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate\nAnd going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy the growing frustration felt by students and their teachers around the world has\nGiven rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about and so I have to put\nMy own hand up here I chose the core charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance so many other areas the person who pays the piper cools the to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's models allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nHad massive Marty's economics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bathroom even criminal behavior by bank because that can freshman financial stability\nWe need a much more diverse group of\nResearchers in economics and teaches and mental is\nMore diversity and will shift the balance of the topics that are chosen for research it will give us much more tolerant to make it very plain and I think there's every reason to think that the subject will become even more vibrant even more\nPromising as a way of taxing the really big problems that we face\n\nSince the financial crisis that's been a healthy soul searching in economics the growing number of people in organizations have been pointing out the obvious froze and developing alternative views to better understand and improve the way the economy's work\nHas this actually have an impact with masters\nCountry must so says there's some evidence that it's not just lip service that change really is taking place\nWe had the political successive somebody like come up ... with his inequality critique\nWe've had you know governments looking into different ways of measuring GDP we've had the big institution that's probably the biggest change like the IMF and the city if you look at what they used to say before the crash in what they say now\nIt's it's very very different take me in the city that recommendations recipes for how cave\nCreate more jobs in the economy in the in the nineties it was all about deregulating and it was back there in Texas and it was a bad set of making the labor market more flexible in a in a certain way\nAnd now we feed them now it's the talk about the importance of\nUnions and the importance of having a relatively high wages send it it's ... it really has\nChanged and I do definitely think that the consequences of the crisis end of the discussions that we've had in the last ten yes\nHaving worked with the obesity the organization for economic cooperation and development I can vouch for this progress which is also reflected in the IMF work on inequality and it's and the bank of England's work on climate change\nI've seen the first time how much economics has changed since two thousand and make new perspectives different ways of teaching and far more of a move towards understanding how crushes come about\nThe good news is that there's been some progress the bad news is that this was not it filtered through what he's done in the financial sector will impacted on policy may cause\nI Believe that the best way to make sure those in power will hold their ideas about economics is for us all to get involved\nThis was saying economics is too important to be left to the economists if we were all more confident the economics of Metra about daily bread wrong and something belonging to men in suits we will be better able to smell Iraq when something's too good to be true such as being offered a mortgage when we can't afford to pay its\nBut many people think of economics as very complex and the role of the remote subject how can we overcome and encourage people to get stuck in to improve our economic literacy\nJust like to statistics will politics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn it means we can better understand the world around us and we would be better informed and more able to speak out about big national decisions such as regarding migration and trade\nWhen do you call them as citizens across the whole range of jobs especially journalists need to take more interest in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history\nAnd a better understanding of how different countries operate\nIs going to provide a much broader basis of understanding so that when something new tens up like the threat of trade was then the kind of resonance the idea that somehow that they had been tried was before that they hadn't had serious economic consequences\nIn the Nineteen thirties that can have a resonance with people with a broader public\n[noise]\nHope it's a great economic literacy will make our government's more accountable for economic decisions they take which impact on our lives
