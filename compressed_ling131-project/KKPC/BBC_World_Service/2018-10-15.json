stand\nWhere they were coming from but that changed with the crisis so the crisis itself\nBrought a big expansion in the latest meetings because the countries of the world in particular rich countries in this case realize\nThey couldn't learn that the emerging market and developing countries' economies were already close to half the world's economy close enough to ... and then come and you couldn't try and handle the crisis with that amount of the economy outside their own\nSo it really did change and that was a very significant thing I think in in retrospect\nBehind the scenes to countries were forced to work together more closely to stitch financial regulations into place to try and limit the damage to the crisis was doing\nThe G twenty heads of state put together coordinated plan to stimulate their economies in order to help prevent a worldwide depression but despite these initially improvements in financial corporation the other early signs that were less hopeful\n[noise]\nIt became obvious that the focus of politicians on the mounting national problems came at the expense of vital global commitment international effort on all sorts of friends from aid to the environment undermined the urgent replaced the important [noise]\n\nBack in the year two thousand I was at the millennium summons hungry in eighty nine countries agreed to the millennium development goals series of commitments to reduce will publicity\nOver the next Fifteen Years ... was the leading advisor to the United nations are meeting these goals he was frustrated at how the financial crisis undermined developments\nPost two thousand eight was the middle of the so called Millennium Development goal Fifteen year period\nI was the special advisor to the secretary general of the un first Kofi Annan on the Ban Ki moon on these Millennium Development goals and when the financial crisis came\nThe attention which was not all that strong to begin with on these goals basically disappeared the funding was frozen\nImportant institutions like the global fund to fight aids TB and malaria actually skipped funding rounds because the\nDonor countries so called war donating so the recipient countries couldn't get the funds for aids treatment or malaria or other urgent matters\nAnd this is the kind of spill over that was really rife throughout the whole world\nCould mean neither is now the head of Amnesty International back in two thousand nine he was executive director of Greenpeace and came smack up against a similar issue as he said at the time the financial crisis was the final boots and this other place of negotiations to stop climate change I asked him to explain what he meant by that\nThe financial crisis was also happening at a time when\nSome off us naively believed that our politicians at the the heightened ... that was coming out\nOf the climate community and we were getting up to the Copenhagen climate summit way we were hoping to get what we called ... deal another fabulous the bus fare ambitious and binding deal\nAnd uh in reality has the world knows we go to flab outcome full of loopholes and bull\nAnd there's no question that the financial crisis puts a damper on the possible outcomes in that very part in Copenhagen climate summit in two thousand nine\nAnd I would argue that one of the reasons given often was\nEven behind the scenes discussions with political leaders especially from the so called developed countries was that you know we can deal with this right now because of the Financial Times says we have to recover and so on and\nWe were I'm successfully agree that a crisis actually is a moment of opportunity let's look at how we can redesign sudden things that we take for granted and so on\nFar from the crisis leading to a greater collaboration is given rise to nationalism and protectionism and severely undermined cooperation between the advanced countries and between them and the rest of the world\nThis was immediately evidence in lower commitments

financial crisis and that was as you know a searing experience for many Asian countries\nAnd the lessons they learned from that to be very very careful or make sure you're not too highly in debt that you make sure that yourself a lion and that you don't ever have to sort of depend on next rescue package\nTo a save you and so as a result of that crisis\nThe level of debt in most Asian countries went down and they were very prudent and castle and they can manage them and uh and that's why it's actually quite stunning how most of the Asian countries except perhaps or South Korea sail through the global financial crisis quite well\nTo be completely Ken did you have to acknowledge that all which really all the Asian countries colonized by the west and during that period of western colonization Asians develop any strong inferiority complex and I know there's a firsthand because I was born in Nineteen forty eight and single poll\nWhich was a British colony and I grew up as a

appropriate level of of trauma she has to be truthful um she she can't be overly um resentful or angry um and and Dr blazing for was able to do that so most of the commentators even on\nUm Fox TV that leans a to a supporting a President Trump everybody was saying this is a very very grave situations very very serious so it was a testament to her credibility you\nAre a civil rights activists and you're also a feminist as well as ... a law professor\nYou've written a lot about in the sexuality and the different themes of oppression on how they work sometimes income so sometimes in different ways and how people need to be aware and ... to learn to put it bluntly do you think America found it easier to relate\nTo the issues raised by dumped field causes of white woman when they found it to relate to everything that Anita Hill raised where she was a black woman complaining about sexual harassment than a black man\nI absolutely think that a race has a lot to do with credibility I think that the the fact that\nThey were a both white ... both elite\nUm that she was seen as more credible more reliable\nUm that's the part of the story that is a reflection about racial differences both and the stereotypes that women carry with them and their ability to be believed at the end of the day it's it's more or less that it just didn't matter\nUm so yes she might need to leave the name Susan Collins who was who cast in many ways the deciding vote said that she believed her she believed that the trauma that happened um she didn't necessarily believe she was remembering correctly that\nIt was judge Kavanaugh who did it and at the end of the day what ever happened to her didn't really matter a in judging a the the qualifications of a judge Kavanaugh um so I I think at the end of the day what we see here is is what I sometimes call you know this curse of asymmetry\nShe had to do a lot to be credible and even when she did all that\nThe burden basically shifted their hands\nAnd there was virtually nothing he could do a that would have destroyed his credibility if that performance that we saw in including a loss of temper a\nTo Democrats if all of that wasn't

brought commoner denies all those allegations and\nThat was a scene throughout the the hearings but but here's the the the basic question I have for you because your analysis of the way society works and you'll you'll work on this is what you call into ... it's become extremely influential across America but would it be fair to say that you see\nThe the key components in society in America today as being groups on Groupon identities rather than individuals who is that a fair reflection of how you see things\nWell I see things in terms of structures that make your group identity a subject to a ... this empowerment our power\nSo the entire a conversation that we've been happening over the last couple of weeks has been about men it's been about women um it's it's been about Republicans it's been about Democrats and really bring\nThe food we wouldn't be the men and women\nI find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist road it's time to hold back into survival mode due to the dumpster fire and live by a black feminist agenda and\nI mean this lady and\nPeople who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss um respond to moments like these by showing that there are few individuals\nWho are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who um is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women\nIt's not surprising I'm often frustrated might as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr lazy Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working it doesn't mean that we don't need the intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I don't mind described as a problem\nI I get I get the intersect now the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups have particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be with us on a majority

for them is that they're VIP members which is the thousand chief marketing officer of some of the biggest companies in the world using our platform they've created this private experience for all of the CEOs\nAnd we're talking with GMOs a target and Walmart and Johnson and Johnson\nThis platform to collaborate on actions around the marketing industry\nSo it's a closed secure network you're offering to spoke to each organization\nYes exactly and spoke it being a good word because it's fully branded their organization and and so it's got the features of social networking chat technology for collaboration fundraising advertising an artist Pete matching\nThat's interesting because it's a it's a bunch of things as you say but I was going to us could really flat as question which is what's wrong with a Facebook group or a or what's that group was something of quibble as\nWell as the easy answer is that a Facebook group first of all can you trust Facebook in our environment in our platform you own your own data which is really key you can control your environment you can control the experience your members have that's a really big deal more secure you think you'll hack proof\nTruth is a strong word I Would never things that's nothing is ... ... if I weren't enough to know that\nBut it is very very secure an encrypted we're actually integrating biometric security from Unisys into our platform so you can actually have full biometric written a recognition facial recognition voice recognition to get in and we're also implementing block tainted novelty which will increase the privacy and security of the data\nLet me just in the companies the private sector people you speak to the clients who come to you do you get the feeling that there is a growing demand that we need I suppose for this kind of sharing off of the Web the Web has become such a style environment for many companies isn't it\nAbsolutely and that's I think what we're really picking up on when we started five years ago I had to explain what community was and now everybody understands community everybody understands that the public social media world has its purpose but it's more about broadcast messaging an advertising and it's not about\nPrivacy and security and not branded so like when a company puts their page\nOn Facebook they're getting Facebook the right to use their brand and that's about it a little bit crazy\nDenise Hayman lower he says she's now getting interest not just for corporations with UN agencies desperate for this type of play secure network the shipping

when they find themselves interacting strangers on the line\nI have season tickets to the local uh basketball franchise\nAnd I never get to go because I'm traveling all the time so I end up selling them on Craig's list ah sites\nThose sites want your mobile number they generally want an email address sometimes they want more information and what happens is once that information is on that site it's there forever and so I'm getting calls for the concert that's in town or I'm getting calls for you know the the next local event\nAnd those numbers are impossible to block they're impossible to keep out of your general kind of day to day use and so what I use my pseudo\nFor is I generate a persona that allows me to sell on Craig's list with a separate set of information separate phone number separate email and when the seasons over I can just delete that identity there's no connection back to me there's no personal information floating out there so\nSteve the guy who's regularly setting his tickets because he can never make it to the game you you've got one set of phone numbers and Steve who's actually now called John but you put another email they can email John every time to get those tickets he wouldn't have another Steve he's buying from he never needs to know\nIt never needs to know and and I we see this a lot with folks especially people who are potentially at risk on line it's one thing for me\nTo sell Jessica does nothing for women to solve so far on line and meet strangers that she doesn't know we've all heard about the river stocker or these other kinds of sort of safety risks that folks have on line and I think we've had this kind of a symmetry between the amount of information were compelled to share\nAnd the amount of information we would like to share\nNow we know over time that companies like Facebook and Google and others\nReally didn't need to know all that information because you are the product the more they know about you the more they can sell you and we want to just shift the balance back to sort of more user center control and we think it's unique we haven't seen anything I'll flick that\nStation and founder of tech start up a

harvesting that data particularly so getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nOr they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely

others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government once it's\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs timber nervously has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSort of the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eyes to opt in to the data

in Yemen\nBecause Saudi Arabia is has a prime responsibility not so responsibility for prime responsibility for the biggest a humanitarian disaster in the world according to some people right now with millions of people in the point of salmon\nAnd uh the international community has failed to to uh to tough um Saudi Saudi Arabia and its allies from carrying out this very destructive a

said\nCongress may think differently Congress ... there were assigned slipped Congress is Gary itself up to take a strong line on the question of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and they use in Yemen the\nSaudi Arabian response so far is basically we don't care what would change that\nBut I think that uh if if we went to ... supply we and the Americans were stopped supplying weapons to uh to Saudi

what they were because Saudi Arabia is so important in the region and so important with it's available funds\nWell my first thought was that that would be the case I felt that I'm a material interests
