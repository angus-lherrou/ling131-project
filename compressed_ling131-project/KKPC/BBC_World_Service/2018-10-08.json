on and we have [noise]\nIn the u._s. it's estimated that the crisis cost at least twenty thousand dollars for each person and overtime resulted in the loss of Fifteen trillion dollars of national wealth\nEquivalent to almost one year's economic activity the greatest pain has been felt in the old industrial cities in small towns where there's a great concentration of homes affected by the collapse in the mortgage market Jeff Smith executive director of the Institute of housing studies in Chicago explains\nThe way that the foreclosure crisis in the financial crisis affected housing markets in the states is that it really started\nTo most heavily impact neighborhoods where you had a high concentration of subprime loans and you had a lot of families being evicted from their homes due to for a closer you had a lot of vacant abandoned meant in those neighborhoods and it was really concentrated in a lot of urban or an African American neighborhoods in cities and suburbs across the country\nSo in Chicago you got some neighborhoods where over forty percent of the housing units in those neighborhoods were hit by at least one foreclosure over the foreclosure crisis the house itself\nIt was likely abandoned and overvalued so in many cases the value of the mortgage was much greater than the actual value of the property causing blight in many neighborhoods in Chicago and other parts of the country\nI us Jeff what happened to these people foreclosure\nIs a negative event on your credit score credit scores are very you know significant numbers of these days and when lots of people make decisions on not just if you can get a loan\nOr for a car for a mortgage for a credit card but also use if you can get a job you can get a apartments so it was a big event that had a significant effect not just on where they live but also options going forward\nIn the U.S the crisis has skewed homeownership to older borrows with strong credit ratings homeownership rates for under forty five substance sharply since the crash\nOver forty percent of housing wealth is now held by the open sixties compared to only of course it before the crash Flora and middle income families and young people have not benefited from the increasing housing values in recent years\nJust highlights the extent to which the diverging fortunes of the property market led to increased inequality\nThe economy at least for certain components of the economy has improved and you see investments coming into the city but that's really only touching maybe a third to half of of the city neighborhoods and the rest of the city is continuing to struggle and really hasn't recovered\nFrom the financial crisis the neighborhoods still lack investments the families who live there struggle for finding employment and Ford will housing\nSo I think what you've seen in Chicago and he I think what you've seen it a lot of cities is growing tale of two cities where the fortunes of the rich and the folks who have resources that have been getting a better on the fortunes of the folks who\nAre struggling and are getting worse\nThe growing inability of low income people to sell their homes and moved the dynamic cities with a new job search we found combined with the fact that the U.S government spends one six of the average of other advanced countries on the labor market retraining has reduced the\nAbility of people to escape their predicament\n[noise]\nBetween Nineteen Seventy in two thousand eleven hundred and forty seven countries experience banking crises two thousand eight was the mother of all crises in the severity and global impacts averaging comes in the rich world which the grunt uninterrupted since the second World War found\nThe U.S economy was within three is about a third smaller than it would have been had they not being a crisis this was despite the fact that the U.S in boxing the stimulation package which sought to minimize the impact\nProfessor Joseph Stiglitz was received the Nobel Prize for economics explains the reasons\nWhenever a economy is hit by a crisis economy goes down tax revenues go down often expenditures have to go out for unemployment welfare benefits\nAnd so even countries with surpluses wind up having deficits and even more if you have to spend a lot of money to bail out the banks\nHistorically there have been many instances where government and seeing that deficit say that deficit will result in a loss of confidence\nWe have to get rid of the deficit the way you get rid of the deficit is cut back expenditures which is called us therapy for raise taxes but actually really hard to do the middle of a downturn\nHerbert Hoover who was the president when the stock market collapsed in Nineteen twenty nine used austerity\nAnd I credit him with converting the stock market crash into the great depression\nThe Obama administration had learn the lesson that the renowned British economist John Maynard Keynes drew from the great depression sooner after Obama became president in early two thousand nine Congress approved the seven hundred and eighty seven billion dollar American recovery and reinvestment act\nWhich aims to spur consumer spending and restore investor confidence through a combination of tax credits increases in welfare payments and cheap loans for businesses\nIn addition the Federal Reserve pumped money into the economy to reduce interest rates and then the experiment known this quantitative easing that also was adopted in the u._k. and Europe\nIn the U.S over four trillion dollars was added to the money supply in this way and then you can Europe at least ... trillion\nCanes great work address the question was should have been done and\nThe answer is not austerity but stimulation what happens in the economic downturn is people get fearful their spending and except vicious cycle is that now spend the economy gets weaker and austerity is a downward spiral\nIn Nineteen twenty nine governments acted like people and when times got tough they reduce spending but while it's rational for people to tighten their belts in tough economic times came showed that if governments did the same they would make matches far worse\nAnd the government's needs to overcome fear an economic contracts and by spending to reignite demand [noise]\n\nIn Europe and the u._k.

percent and the first round and do you think he's low numbers are rejection of him in person or is it a rejection of what he represents the party there he represents and the fact that he has the

fact that speech in the previous record set for a weekend you know type of by more than ten million dollars that was set back in twenty thing with a film called the ...\nI asked Kim mosque is about ... she's the editor at large all the Hollywood Reporter she's based in LA and I asked him what's behind this record ticket sales number\nSo there were two movies that appeal to a very different audiences ... which is one of the minor marvel characters ... movies have been very successful does appeal or appeal to younger men\nAnd a star is born with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper which appeals

you know it's like a popcorn movie that would play in the summer accept it played really well in October\nNow we're often told that people are going to the cinema less often than they used to because they used to the convenience of harm streaming or that the market which has seen a growing number provide is now with the Netflix Amazon Prime and others but it does sound as people are still going to the cinema if he can get them the right product\nRight if they want to see it they will go and of course this kind of marvel movie this is not from Disney's marble Disney owns the main marvel movies with\nIron Man and the you know the black panther those all came from this latest such Sony Pictures and they certainly got off to start with ... with a star is born first of all Bradley Cooper as

O. two increases is driving the extreme weather and sick and he says something about the way climate change works that does more than merely adjunct the worst whether by increments\nThat second one will take us to the Arctic which could be locking us into patents have drowned them then huge like we've seen this summer the first takes us to the new science of where the attribution as practiced by climate scientists like Oxford University Freddie also looking for the links between climate change and extreme weather\nWhat education brings is basically it's bringing climate change home where people live because\nWhile global mean temperature is a very good measure of climate change\nIt is not what kills you how climate change many tests is through changing extreme weather events and so with that to ...\nWe can show which extreme weather events that people have experienced and you can say is climate change really a game changer here and it's still by how much\nBut they're also extreme events that are not made more likely\nMean extremes are just part of the climate system they're part of the weather too they happen naturally but they're sometimes is a human induced effect on that and we want to be able to parse out what his natural from what is the anthropogenic\nEvery extreme and that is unique say you will never be able to say that an event was just caused by climate change I Would have an impulsive without climate change how what we can say is how the likelihood of an event occurring is changing the cause of climate change\nThe player in this exercise is more ... of ... the ...

something the climate model stern\nAnd the scorching Russian ... of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty twenty eleven climate scientists more or\nLess worried about links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing change and extreme weather you know with with one of these papers a contribution to that discussion actually showing that especially here twice but also after rainfall events\nAre strongly increasing to climate change and that this was already a really detectable into observational data we have\nWith just a few years hindsight didn't

a host of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also autistic to them as they happen ... outfit will win attribution examines the European heat wave focusing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave days and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today\nAnd so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask ... won the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without end to the gym and climate change and then the case of doubling ... it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to begin a climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely buy into the guinea climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of over ... degrees were busting ooh\nThey seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study that looked pizza remain that way\nThe further north so into to finish places we looked at and we found that it's much much of it right then and the well we live and so it was and that's how the ... than it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty year then so it was a match rare event\nBut we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are all over the place and so you're uncertainties that much higher layers and that's how climate change actually made this a relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the data and climate modeling this is the managing former as Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where stimulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing in effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above in the current climate relatives to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from wells expert so often the is finished\nAnd then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow so the assessment for twenty Seventeen is now taking shape we won't know what they will make twenty Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the fart up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading\nThe extreme looms across Asia warm studies said we're not been possible without climate change slugs in central

elsewhere but looking back over the series of reports and they ... trends stand out\nOh temperature no doubt a temperature the increasing the likelihood of daily extremes five daily extreme seasonal extremes\nThat right there is a pretty unequivocal at this point we have pretty high confidence in those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells though to those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought\nI'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes that right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will that please be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\nWell I live right\nOn all sides of the right way up\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season stunted his models was suggesting we were heading for something Robert comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nNorth south around the north pole this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and it internist hearing on whether in more alarming directions\nYou know and one return the jet stream moved north what's it brings\nWarm air from some topical regions fall North Korea it's very warm temperatures region slide Siberia\nAnd at the same time beaches where the jet stream bent self words it brings in the Arctic all of a self correcting relatively cold conditions so what's your turn to see if you're either way the jet stream your tendency\nAlternating are normally smuggled him off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it and do the two thousand\nAnd the particular version of this wave that most of ... when Michael Mann is called ... treat wave residents where these we go take up more and more energy and become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at the weather diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out\nAnd that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just one particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing it extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nOr around the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds to the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed passing the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low 'cause it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure system that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us and then the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system in there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree wave residents is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporate that into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will needs to be developed but if it is an optical woman is the drawing in the news from the ... good\nWe find it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global steel to emissions and they see as decline in the Arctic and we see it in summer but we also see at an all months of the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there is a really dominant mechanism of\nRadioactive warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor\nIn terms of a long term trend of the ice change in the Arctic\nAnd in our two thousand sixteen paper we competed that for every metric tons of the attitude that added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters of the ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of any relationships and climbed a lot of forecasts\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate of sea ice loss per increasing C O two\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecasts of sea as conditions from climate

I mean if we go into sort of the turnout so extraordinarily difficult cases that you've had to deal with let's let's do lunch in Ninety nine and you're being called in\nTo go to ... to hell with the investigation into alleged war crimes and you found yourself in a village where I think for the people including children have been going to list suckered in one particular place by the time you go what was left\nSo when we arrived there which is probably it was probably about six or seven months later what you have in the two rooms are coming gold remains they're very badly decompose because you have twenty eight thirty degree heat 'em you have\nPartially burnt remains they're more or less covered by the titles that are falling from the roof\nAnd the the wild roaming packs of dogs view this as a food source so the ... the bodies will have been partly pulled apart and separated by the dog as well so that that's what you find is a boiling most of my kids partly diaries partly burns on par with the ...\nWere you able to use your skills led them to for those individuals\nSome so what do you have is what we have this mess that DNA souls everything\nWhich it often doesn't you have to have a sample with which to compare that DNA and we generally didn't for these individuals so that won't we would do is we would go down on hands and knees and these ... that make you look a whole lot faster than even you know I Am\nAnd you have black plastic while he puts on and you have a face mask and you have double layer gloves and twenty eight degree heat and you're literally will go through the floor fingertip until you find the first bit of a body or a bone and then you'll start to create the outline of that individual you lift that individual\nAnd generally by this point most of the soft tissue is going so you're looking at button\nOn your identifying yes it is a male will sort of ages the males will sort of heights as the male is there anything about them in terms of that than titian or a disease that they've had are broken bones that they've had that might help their family identify them or are they still wearing some closing unless something in the pockets\nYou have described this as\nOne of the greatest experiences of your life during this and I are struggling through relate to that because it just sounds like a version of hell to me\nUm I I I can see why it would be a vision of how uncertain the I'd never done anything on that sort of a scale before most of the work because I've done within the u._k. had been on single single burials are or or maybe in a single murders so the scale of it was an enormous education for me\nBut also knowing that that this was going to an international criminal court\nMeant that even in the most adverse circumstances we still have to be able to work to the standards that we're all was expected to work too so the challenge was to make sure that our founders didn't split\nDo you see what you do as in an effort to\n... from the store bought is it as a sort of their roads over time which was sort of intriguing ... pills but you're feeding a voyeurism in all of\n'em I it's definitely there\nThere's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime drama there were scared by true crime then by up to loosen up there a fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nAnd ... and for them if they're talking about how a ball they can be ... if you think it's important to get into detail how difficult it don't lizards\nBecause there's so few people will ever become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely sledding\nBut those people who read forensic novels are probably more forensic clear aware than any any part of the public has ever been before\nAnd they can quickly smell like something that doesn't sign rights\nSo what I have is a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and research what does it really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their readers to say this is reality I Know it's just made the salt this has actually how it would be a respect for that\nYou've written a book which is full of extraordinary stores and you describe so many countless experiences you've had weird death\nBut what you do you do and I don't know whether you feel like doing it knows is share your feelings about\nAnd Eve sets limits on how much the government can spend Italy is already the most indebted countries in the euro zone\nYeah Moscow beach in the European Commission of economic and financial if has had this to say on CNBC TV a few days ago\nWe started going to make the choice to be done but he's more from the truth can make you live for a while\nBut then you end up with a very hard that's because he is the country was inexpensive [noise] so you're going to shouldn't be Jewish voters oppose was thirty because we're not supposed to do they're just the two of\nThe defense of the interest of European interest\nBut Rome is defined it won't budge and ... financial markets with interest Italy pays on his government debt going up that's now significantly higher than what Jim and he pays because investors see actually as a big a risk\nIn a moment what that means for the rest of the year isn't the first initially the difference between Italian borrowing costs and Jim and borrowing costs is known as ... spread and Italians follow its ups and downs in the same way that Americans might keep an eye on the Dow Sharon next\nTable this year I was sort of job I Believe the spread is the difference in in trust between the government bones richly in Germany\nOne does it mean to you [laughter] he fed despite the between nighttime bonds and ... it's very high and you are in the ...\nThe good yes because all the media shouts about the spreads\nThis worry for me comes from the media\nBut to be honest I Can't understand exactly the economic dynamic some of it too and I was surprised that you have a lot of the ... yes I Believe I Know what the spread is the most famous one is the difference in the value of interest between government bones\nAnd those of Germany I Do worry democracy don't even touch the fence to see some of the ... in some ways I'm worried but in others note because\nI've seen throughout the years these things have highs and lows the gender and this is not a nice thing\nThat are big risks associated with increasing the deficit if we don't succeed is sticking with the parameters of the ... from us sanctions in in the end it will be old and re people who will pay the price so what\nDoes it mean to you when you have not spread between ... idea why the ... I'm not an advertising he died yeah and\nWe are so used to the ... since the ... to be able to allow him to fight the spread there was a time when we talked about was the spread and that it was the only instruments with which we could measure our economic policies\nWe go so accustomed in this period to keep an eye on the spread as soon as it rises we get more into debt so I Do worry in a sense that he is an area to pay attention\nTo market savvy Italians that speaking to climate of opinion in Turin\nMany of them may want to give the new government to the right wing leg ... and anti establishment five star movement a child so\nProbably the problem is invested in the European Union I'm nowhere near as keen clouds ... is a leg up parties economic spokesman I put it in ... tripling the budget deficit initially to to put four percent of his government now plans to do puts Rome on a collision course with the IV in Brussels\nThe actual number is perfect in line with what it was within the last ... or ... or ... other major countries they are they are doing good\nBut I think this the perception is isn't it an and the fact is that for ... you can say from ... and other countries are given different treatment by the European Union when it comes to exceeding that budget deficits but actually has a much much larger debt the question is really is it kind of even afford these kind of budget deficits that\nKind of question is not present in other countries\n... well I mean probably there is something that I wasn't aware also because the Romney the possibility of that that does change the because uh I I was thinking that that there was these are doing it to that was a sixty percent of that and\nHe hit the debt that level should not to say yes\nSo basically if they're willing to say that the that that should not exceed the sixty percent to eat it well I don't see the difference between when I'm ... percent than what I'm going through it otherwise would be a matter of money but I don't know if it's not it's not that the reason other rules that say you start going through your head that the people in that let's say\nA sixty and uh when I'm that have been saying that they asked me to grow up they like the soy trials\nTypically yawn or when I'm going to end up then you should do proceed Rico a policy of any so they'll damaging\nDeck on I mean the point that it actually knock it I'm not convinced that the economy will grow at a rate that can fund that kind of a ... that's the issue and that kind of discussion is not present in other countries in the country there are many many more questions about Italian growth\n... if the question is that all young girls so do you think that the only thing more access as it was proposed by the previous government that because that pledge\nOf doing a one percent of the things that are the four was based on it but I'm ... so maybe the grief I think that in it for me as if you can now and they raised ... boxes that you know substantial wave roofing because that's ready to go more or less\nMy perception invest your dirty bomb or he was going to go on the\nLine with your line is basically the tax cuts necessary to stimulate growth will fuel rods and so what does that growth that your planning in the budget does not materialized surely you must be worried the labels and get into some serious problems when it comes to servicing its status\nAs a as you the servicing of the day the ... is something that you said most granted only in Europe because in all\nThe other war the ... and also in the European Union we've come to that doesn't have the European Central bank basically there is no risk or off or a finance during the day probably there should be ... but it's the risk of inflation or other kinds of ... of course I present\nAbout them not to the risk of that the ... stay out of the market I Know you said\nYou said that most of the problems would be sold if it had its own currency but the fact remains it doesn't it just passed the euro being passed the euro involves various pledges and promises when it comes to spending when it comes to that\nAnd that the European Central bank has said it will actually the backstop ... modeled argue has said he will do whatever it takes to save the euro but there is this concern that its ally if everyone's into problems would be just too big to safe does that not worrying\nAbout whether we have to understand a lot of that because a\nBusy street and you probably know we are an ethical sort of the European so basically we are paying the European Union if he doesn't receive a single penny by European Union about the cost of these we have to understand what is good for the guy going to call them and at the moment the February ... the last line of the growing economy\nIn Europe but I Would say in the words of him that I don't think that is lost the infamous off the show and they don't solve the industry three or something I'd these okay but if you've ever played soccer so basically\nWe export much more much more ... more than what we\nHave a primary budget stop blessed so basically we collected docs is much more than what we spend and these numbers is not perception or something that would be and of course we have a wonderful county so it's a lot of potential but the dose they are the policies that we put in place in the past the\nShow that they have to these incredible what they show stood out to be\n... in the world in terms of girls so it's not to be a a you know but rising economy to understand that you need the counter she could go places\nSo uh that's that's the only way you know the European Union expecting to see that we should do\nThat they should the damage our girls but rather that we are paying the club ... allows us to do something but it's obvious that you\nContrary to what any kind of sense but boys and social ... should do well ... we should discuss it there'll be more and I think that you're going to do these after the election of may where all these a five year old a ... which change\nIf the market reaction is that the spread the cost of Italian debt compared to say Jim and dental Spanish that does why didn't significantly as a result of these plans and as a result of the confrontation with the European Union\nWould you expect the European Central bank to step in and help somehow ... what what what what is it what you expect what what is it what you want to see from the European Union\nThey they should do because uh it's a it's a problem you can also would think that if every bailouts such a stupid thing that a country like he goes out of the market the ups everything that the end of that are no consequences which like on through like well\nI think\nIt's a threat isn't it that you're putting down to the European Union saying we're we're going to do this you're just going to have to accept it because we are too big for you to try and find\nA soldier garbage dumps way we're going to do because it's the right thing to do for our economy\nIf the European Commission rejects your budget well then\n... the European Commission will reject or a ... face the consequences are are going to face up are examples science or something I Do on the European we will defend the in that situation but I'm sure that\nWe are going to defend ourselves in the new parliament and in the new European Parliament believe me the balance of powers would be much much you're starting to ...\n... what what do you keep on having a relationship with the new generation off a European nation from France from Germany or something at the end but I'm fairly radical students that are going to use a ... will be up at least when you're\nUntil you meant that it would be a war

inter governmental\nA panel on climate change who said massive changes will be needed to keep the overwhelming to below one point five degrees Celsius these include changes to the food we eat the lights we live in the way energies generated they'd be chicken has more\nWith China India and others so reliance on coal and other fossil fuels the idea of such a rapid shift seems implausible on top of that President Trump is in the process\nOf withdrawing from the only international agreement on climate change\nAnd the front runner in Brazil's presidential election wants to do the same but on the other hand electric cars are set to become more mainstream how the costs of wind and solar energy a folding dramatically health similarly governments must decide whether to act on the report or ignore it and hope that the conclusions wrong\nBrazil is facing a polarizing second round in his presidential election off the phone right candidate enjoyable to know to not only failed to secure an

people's livelihoods\nTheir calculations I mean there's not so much a ... a case of increasing investment but switching investments away from things like investment and fossil fuel infrastructure towards investment in low carbon renewable energy energy efficiency electric vehicles are center\nBut does mean that overall energy investments we need to go up to keep within one point five degrees but it does not pollute us\nA kind of a showstopper ... you know for for economic progress carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere for hundreds of years on we are now living with the consequences of activities that have previously been taken you use the fossil fuels in the last ... last few decades and even before about\nAnd I think the message we go there it is not too late you know one point five degrees can be done within the laws of physics and chemistry but perhaps the most important point is the political will the kind of institutional changes that might be needed to take up the opportunities that are available\nBut that's kind of not for the scientists to do I mean not the message that uh\nWe're taking to the main audience for the port which is the governments that will be meeting in Poland later this year to take the next steps under the framework convention on climate change\nProfessor gyms ski scientist that political will exist Mary Robinson is a former president of Ireland and a former un special envoy on climate change she's also author of a book called climate justice\nBut first of all I think we should acknowledge that it was the climate vulnerable countries the least developed countries ... developed in states who insisted on having one point five degrees\nCelsius in the Paris Agreement that we have to work towards us and hence the politicians asked scientists office this mean what's the difference between two degrees and one point five we've never had that before we've never had this kind of a wake up call of how serious it is and how we have to do\nA urgently needs to be done in the next eleven years and so that by twenty thirty were in the right position and\nI you know not only did the thunder but countries egg insists\nAnd that that would be in the Paris Agreement but they're also the ones that are most bishops at the moment the Marshall Islands I made a commitment lost during the U.N General assembly weaker time as we can do you look that they published their twenty fifty and an agenda which includes net zero emissions\nOr Fiji is about to do the same let me put it this way it's the Marshall Islands was on the Security Council this would be the priority it should be and I hope that this report will really encourage at new thinking and new political courage\nBut shouldn't the message ... playing devil's advocate I shouldn't have message be look it's not just about those low lying island states actually this is about everybody and the consequences if the science is right to me I PCC gathered thousands of studies\nThen we ... we all have to act in our own interests\nSo absolutely I couldn't agree more other than to using the small islands as having secure and we got this good scientific report to show us how serious it\nIs you know what I mean is that there isn't that the people just say oh actually you know I I'm not going to change my behavior because we're just talking about a few you know ... remote smoke you know under populated on in the long way away this doesn't concern me\nAnd that's the value of the scientific report it makes it perfectly clear that\nAnd we have only that small window of a lesson years to twenty thirty to make sure that we take the necessary steps and they are ambitious and we do have to move out of ... and into clean energy very quickly and it's really important that we do it and it will be take the steps we take protect\nCoral communities including their land rights civil rights and already we're seeing some abuses in and clean energy being introduced in with big projects that don't consult with indigenous peoples or ... or a small community\nAnd from the climate justice point of view this really is the reports we'd been waiting for to warn us that's two degrees is dangerous that the we must stay at one point five to have a safe world for our children and grandchildren it's a kind of ... humanity\nThere isn't though as far as I can see there isn't the political will to do that at the moment I mean it's it's just not what's being talked about it said\nWell I'm going to king that women worldwide wake up do we want to say for for our children and grandchildren it's urgent us and we have a window of time when we can and should take the measure is necessary and they all do it but it's quite clear from the report their doable but they require\nGreat political

the lines of a right wing achieving power in many countries about I'm just one more yeah so what do you think is driving that\nIn the case of Brazil or several things that the anti corruption feeling in the country is very strong and that is pretty much associated with the with the workers' party which was his main opposition\nThere's the security questions in Brazil has been suffering high levels of crime especially in the big cities you know something like sixty three thousand people were murdered last year this gigantic and when somebody comes around with his background which is a military
