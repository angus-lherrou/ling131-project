war and the ... on top of the country not swear about twenty percent\nOf the country live there's been a political crisis that for two years now and the government didn't listen to the demands of the younger friends they wanted more autonomy and the education sector and with the judiciary and the judicial sector and the government really didn't listen to them a tour and in fact the government even looked up\nMost of the people that I should have talked to the right to the beginning of the crisis and then ... and the power of them have started to form of groups in anger find areas and that's a real\nCrisis and of course it's a massive problem for the elections\nI don't get the sense though from what you've said that you think a much of that will change as a result of today's voting\nNo I think that's right I think the the vote today will change much I think like all these kinds of elections there a kind of taking the temperature and they ... about the direction of the country but unless we get a really major upset in themselves and to change things what\nOne way it's international crisis group or try to push for is to get to talks with the with the ... the government needs to talk to the representatives of the ... a minority and they need to do the whatever happens with the election sign that sense I think you're right I think things are going to fundamentally change today but it does\nWhat happens is they don't give a sense of the temperature of the country\nA lot of the president's poll be a little bit about him while he stands for him while he believes in and how he has conducted himself in power for as long as he's been a\nWhile it's a great question and many people have been scratching their heads about exactly your question for a very long time because he almost never speak in public\nBut I think as I said I found that with yeah I'm\nKim [noise] the ... they need that I didn't know or ... ... if I'm In my mind I think the problem I think it's actually handling and got to see that she makes money well I mean what is the real goal Lydia ...\nTo unify did two countries economically and commercially to South Korea and North Korea and that would be a mess and giant in economic times or it will challenge who she'll like Japan and he will be in the day may important trade partners for China\nSo this is the deal I'm do not Tom tom and made a lot of fast and the house to North Korea but at the end of the day I think so far as being out maneuver by you know\nI just thought it was for me that in your mind actually the relationship between Pyongyang and sold is more important than if you're going to the president moon's real therefore is significant\nCivil they pressed him on that um as being danced in when we came up that much because I didn't have to buy\nIt struck that is in love with him\nDown to of course yeah I yeah I ... a one time to eat the news saying that it shows of that ad says he's swinging it so you never know but the truth is\nNow dean of Clinton station program as actually being done and I'm like no way that North Korea were denuclearize\nI'm being poor sense of China as being the even more paramount anyone before and then he went to China twice\nA day is it costs some contact with the Chinese so the isolation that we've seen in two thousand and Seventeen is completely gone what ... what does Trump Card in exchange yeah they certainly nothing from the states\nWe let's see we'll keep an eye on that have no doubt in as well you said they were never they were going to talk about the Brazilian elections at various points during the program I think you would backing in Brazil fairly ... what sense do you get\nA ... as it's happening in many other places in tents polarized and you'll find the family friends friends from old days or so divided and it's becoming abrasive\nPeople to the point if people breaking up friendships more so than before more so more than I've ever seen ... I Lived through the military dictatorship but things are pretty extreme but but now uh it's it's intense protests\nI Wonder how it affects your work here because he was to tell the story of of other parts of the will to Brazilians is there an appetite for that\nAt the moment yeah funny enough for it so the the cover when I first came\nHere ... we were living world when I was living abroad either in America are here\nThe the censorship are so intense in Brazil that foreign coverage just do covert we had tons of things to do because you couldn't report on much about what's happening there was a heavily censored was now in this election is perfect example is the opposite if\nThere is so much interest in what's going on there is a very literal space left like this whole past week I have no work to do because they're not interested in things happening here while I just I'm all about what's happening we invited you even if you busy I'm planning to come from\nStudio ... throughout the or the next couple of hours or so to move either will set his Facebook page if you wish Europe as we've just painted a moment ago is a place with plenty of political turmoil just now\nAmong particular source of the closest Brexit a decision made by Britain to leave the European Union as a member of the union that has been free trade between Britain and other member states the EU citizens have a right to live and work in each other's countries but what comes off the brick cities as yet I'm clear\nOn other member states are having to make preparations for whatever type of Brexit may emerge\nReporter pull most has been to one country where Brexit seems likely to have a big impact Bulgaria on the south eastern edge of Europe\n\nI met ... over the gleaming office of the multinational finance company where she works on the outskirts of Bulgarian capital Sophia she has a job as she smiles as she talks about it\nBut Monica had been perfectly happy working at a bank in London then Britain voted to leave the European Union\nThat all the evidence suggests that many British people voted for this so called Brexit because they didn't want people from countries like Bulgaria to have a right to work in the u._k. Monica felt some wanted\nThe Brexit vote all of a sudden it sort of mastered where you were from people who are telling you oh you're from Bulgaria you should probably go back home now that the price of what has happened say my decision was team is that cable Gary uh it's much nicer to be able to contribute to society the openly welcome to you\nKnow basically the guys any I'm On the ...\nThe potential difficulties for Bulgarians living and working in Britain\nIt's a hot topic here it was the lead up to them on the evening news when the British Government recently announced that off the bricks that they wouldn't give you citizens any preferential treatment they would have only the same opportunity to live and work in Britain as any other foreign national\n... within the vertical slant\nAnd the freedom to work anywhere in the European Union is particularly cherish tearing Bulgaria country which was so isolated during the ... century it spent as part of the Soviet Bloc\nAnd yet this country also has crucial security interest at stake when it comes to breaks it according to the rest of the ... branch of the think tank the European Council on Foreign Relations\nWe ... we have a ... day with Russia cross the black sea and Britain has always been a perceived as a very strong partner in terms of\nExchanging intelligence information counter terrorism efforts and so on and so forth so losing Britain after Brexit is going to be something that ... will regret [noise]\n\nThe suburbs of even younger I founded vulgarity in business which is so concerned about his relationship with Fritz ... the liquor makes wood furniture and well Britain has been a fellow European Union member dignity could explore that without much in the way bureaucracy\nBritain leaving that advantage is now very much and\nAbout a major blow for a company which prides itself on producing very market goods for Britain's market hotel [noise]\nIs a wonderful smell here of freshly cut would you have these great big slabs of which are fed into the machines here and then come out of the other side is the piece is precisely customer service folks furniture they designed for\nAn hour walk away from all the noise outside so I could have a word with the managing director here [noise]\nMy name is ... and I'm the managing director of the group Britain always been a very important market so we're not so happy with Brexit because it's like going backwards when they need to do with customs and all these ... these big business it's all about speed so neat to be fine\nBut without a doubt\nThan maybe for many people I talked to in Bulgaria Britain's decision to leave the European Union was quite simply a puzzle\nAnd sometimes the source of irritation I sat down in a cafe with a group of young your files among them they'll ... local head of the pros you organization the European Movement and it turned out something of a student of British history\nYou defeat Hitler you'll be pulled out defeated Napoleon and that's why you have the Nelson's colon in order to remind you about the defeat of Nepal and\nSo you have a proven track record of being successful alone apart from the continent\nBut it was in different times now what happened a century or two centuries I go and not be an argument for the situation today but it's done you have to confront the consequences pull\nLoss in Bulgaria I'm the media in Britain inevitably concentrates on the British perspective on Brexit but the rest was quite interesting to hear some of those are the voices especially those who are genuinely puzzled\nBy what's happening yeah absolutely um they need to ... people are talking about ... as a made me say that\nI that the brain tissue will be in great difficulties that because we now on Hedy tried to\nDo today to regret the decision for themselves because they know that trade will be much more difficult I mean one think of the study which I think it's similar to Bulgaria is staying exports of manpower people that movie at two were\nUm because it's easier to get the job I'm also a certain kind of jobs are available yeah last short short supply a back home or in Bulgaria so that is going to have a big impact on the economy ... of these countries that we don't even look at that\nWhen you try and tell the story of Brexit to Brazilian viewers I mean how do you have to you again or they're basically\nAre Romanians are not willing to the gym mate with their presence this\nThank you very much for coming on a black ... who's the director of moves that you want to remain use to algae be chi

I'm I'm I'm into one I'm going to last medals rules for a moment we'll get some comments from the studios and also because the line is a little shaky between you and I was ... when you look at\nHow this might ... what what comes to mind for research to our surprise to hear the ... the events motivated the Republicans mostly as we know Americans usually don't show up in hard numbers for elections generically\nAnd the Democrats more motivated and then the Republicans but now it seems that this is motivated the Republicans\nWhich means I Would think that they will go towards a more conservative view in the mid term elections than we were expecting from previous reports and as a special is just mentions\nIt looks like the Democrats will probably take over the house of representatives\nBut in ... for a little girl and the and the Senate\nRussia [noise] yeah I tend to agree actually would they some analysis [noise] um [noise]\nI think that uh that I'm from is winning more and more name the heart of the ... which is something that was not the case then beginning\nBecause of the economic figures he could well I think\nThe economic fingers are very important because we have precedents all with benefits and economic uh up to an end for sure\nThe U.S economy is doing very well now they can do it of course I mean this is an economic side of the lung 'cause a lot of you who was actually Obama this thought that it is and you know Tom is reaping the benefits but that was his happen\nLet me let me go back to catching a daily ... with a better line of you you had the remarks caffeine in the studio pick up on on any points you heard\n[noise] I I think one point that's very important to make is that opinion about Donald Trump seems on changing and he has stabilized at an approval\nRating that's around forty percent it goes up a point or two it goes down to one or two he is benefiting from what is a very good economy on just yesterday in fact\n\nThe unemployment rate was that we've seen in the United states in Nineteen sixty nine\nSo that's that's helping him on I think the problem in looking ahead to the uh the election which is thirty days away it's quite a ways away lots can happen a lot has been happening in the United states [laughter] um but I think the problem is that the Senate seats are all individual state wide elections\nAnd um it's a landscape that is difficult for Democrats um it is a ... it's going to be a state by state results um it's a little bit difficult for the Democrats\nControl of the Senate everybody knew that it was going to be very hard this year\nIs it also affects the Democrats are clearly against something most obviously Donald Trump put people are less clear about what their full\nHeight I Do think that that's a very good point because\nIt seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis this fear that it is to motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician tends to win\nOr what but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of President Trump they don't like him that's the reason they they turn out they have they have made it very clear that they are concerned now about the Supreme Court\nRepublicans have one that fits conservatives seat on the court so they now have a clear majority they're\nOn and and how long can you keep them interested had not been confirmed I think Republican and Susan yeah as a would've\nContinued and perhaps even grown over the next month the fact that he is confirmed seems the only way you can make them fearful is to make the argument that if the Democrats take control they will teach Brett Kavanaugh on so to try to keep that concern that fear\nAt the top of people's minds is one way of making sure that Republicans stay committed um again I I think we can say much more about this in a week or two when we see how opinion has changed now the cabinet is on the court\nSaid thank you very much for coming on a cussing friend can be treated leading expert in public opinion polling in the United states I Know we were talking about the situation is them bull of member to go we can go to a corresponding ... low and to get the latest on these reports\nThat Saudi journalist who disappeared off going into the country's ... she lives in Istanbul is now feared dead ... ... what do we know for sure at this stage [noise] well\nThey all still allegations Julian at the state so we don't do anything for sure but what we know in terms of the ... uh sources from the Turkish government is an initial investigation from tacky has found\nThat Jamal ... who is a prominent Saudi dissidents critic uh off the uh the Saudi Government um is believed to have been killed off the heat and to the Saudi consulate last Tuesday a to obtain documents for his forthcoming wedding ... woman\nNow detected investigation is saying that Mr ... was killed in a premeditated murder\nOr some reports suggesting that a team of Fifteen people flew in from Saudi Arabia arrives at a concert last Tuesday hearing assemble some of them were officials and they all believed to have potentially being positive I hit squad\nAnd the tax investigation not saying how they believe he was killed fault that they believe his body was then removed from the consulate building I must say that\nA source of the Saudi Government uh untidy consulate here and it's on both sides of the allegations are baseless the Saudi Government is from is maintaining that John ... left the consulate building off to I'm entering it last Tuesday he if he had he disappeared off the top of that time\nAnd presumably there are ways that either side and couldn't substantiate what they're saying I mean television cameras for example records of some description would surely exist to determine who goes in and out of the building like that\nMany of them in the coastal city of pollen where some researchers say this surge of the water was unusually high because of the way it traveled through what channel to hate that of the conversation\nIt's also been pointed out that even if they were adequate you know I mean warnings\nIt wouldn't have been possible to evacuate thousands of people with more or less ... so it was the focus slowly moves towards rebuilding\nWhat can be done to create structures that can hold and protect people who do not have sufficient time to escape\nWith David McGovern his head he's been researching the impact of this you know I'll be on manmade structures he specializes in water engineering at the London south bank University Welcome David moving good morning thank you for coming in letter I made that observation in the introduction\nAbout the surge of water and the channel that naturally traveled along how much of a factor has that being in what happened\n[noise] setting the um [noise] if you have a wave traveling down the channel what can happen it's difficult to tell us quite early days at the moment but what can happen is the you can get reflections of the way bouncing off on the side\nUm and they all have a lot more time to build up its way fight as a troublesome this channels so that could have been a factor in amplifying the damage that that way it might have caused\nI also mentioned how with so little notice the reality of the evacuation thousands of people was just frankly was not going to happen that wasn't time\n[laughter] yeah I mean that part of the world where you've got all these crisscrossing folks very near the coastlines I'm\nEssentially because the folks are quite close to the coast you get this you know me very shortly after I mean that's never really go to be\nThat much time to sound a warning and give people a chance to to go I mean that's just really the way it is because of the the geography of the area the same on the Japanese coast for example\nI think the only had about Fifteen minutes and twenty eleven have warning as well so\nIn which case you are looking to the structure of the buildings that you hope will withstand this\nYeah yeah so in order to design buildings that we would call sue nominate resilient you need to think about a couple of things you need to think about how high they might be so the high enough to allow people to seek refuge above the water line and how strongly a sudden materials that are made of\nAnd particularly how well founded they go into the bedrock and that's quite important are a lot of the structures from what I've seen and the information that we're catching in that area were built tell them or not necessarily well founded into the bedrock build some sort of soil and sediment layers which may well uh uh\nIf you have a structure on a sort of loose kind of material it's not going to be as resilient to those kind of forces and as it would be if it was founded well in the federal\n... what I say clearly maybe you can but you can't necessarily bills every building on to that level but what you do need to do is build enough of big buildings presumably where people know they go to\nIndonesia so so [noise] excuse me except for Nike structures dwellings and things like that it wouldn't be economical but um and it wouldn't be socially um acceptable I wouldn't imagine to ask every person to live in a three story concrete reinforced house on stilts\nSo you need to kind of think about which buildings and ... there's two types of\nStructure I Would say that you need to think about when increasing the resilience of an area the fast one would be a way to people seek refuge and those structures would only be for that purpose and you can build them outside of um says reinforced concrete steel Memphis without walls and so\nYou can imagine a structure which is maybe the shell of the building and\nJust not have any side walls or anything like that it looks like a a a cop hawk or something\nOr and you'd have a sort of the stairway around the side and people would evacuate the roof is building and maybe on the roof you'd have a hotline communications and medical supplies and water and and the thing about that age going to be totally this\nAnd be because there are no sidewalks and it's well founded into the bedrock the full ... at the water is much less semester of most of the ... is just going to go straight through\nAnd let me bring my guess it makes them feel it's a question city of what's in your mind\nWell I I guess my question is how realistic is it that in a poor country you can do something like that where the resources for that and as part of that question was how realistic is it to imagine not allowing people to build in those dangerous areas and for some somewhere else\nI I wouldn't want to and encourage anyone not to live anywhere I think um we like living\nBy the sea it's where are you know\nFor for a number of reasons is also where people make a living is why they go fishing is where the port so you know most of the ... I Love the world's population live by the ocean so the idea of just saying you can't live in a place it's too dangerous especially Ashley these things these events\nI Know we've had sort of three big events now in the last Fifteen sixteen years but that that the relatively red and it's been unfortunate this opposite of two decades so saying that you can't lift the engineers I think what we want to do is try and encourage the built environment which allows people to live where they want to live\nIn the most safe and resilient way um some of the structures like an evacuation ... it's not necessarily expensive um or difficult to build a it just needs to be a well pond and uh\nConstructed with the raw materials in the rye knowledge so it's a lot of this is about getting that knowledge to the people who have building these um these structures and the rest of\n[noise] I think it's a great idea actually amazing that you can build a towel like that then you you can have people\nUh skating to the tower [noise] my my question is you will need to create a system whereby you know you do is try on rent to make sure\nThat he's going to work the people you know whether they're going to that because one of the that the the reason why I\nWe as a very high number of victims because people panic and said do the wrong thing or so especially in a densely populated areas or I should think you know you need to\nLike um ... yeah maybe every ... or something like that so that it's time\nConsuming you have to consume in Arizona's consume means you have to remain to be able to do it and all that stuff and\nNo I I so I we can advise about the the engineering side of things but the whole\nIdea of resilience is a empowering the population yeah into taking a set of\nTheir own responsibility in in the safety and I'm a ... about giving knowledge um are you aware of the evacuation structures which trips as the ones to evacuate students make reference to\nA certain time of day maybe every once in a shopping center maybe the shopping center should be designed\nA with um a structural integrity that will make it safe or the schools you know you've got kids in the schools maybe the schools should have a um but it really depends on uh the local authorities and the un societies in what they they wish\nTo just a brief article so do you mean you mentioned Japan ... other lessons in Japan that people are beginning to learn specifically in this area\nUh yes so I actually visited Japan sort of three years ago to have a look at some of the reconstruction what they're doing and they were hit very badly by the twenty eleven to lose to nominate way and some of the things that they they're doing so the Japanese are builds\nLots of big engineering they're they're they're really into that big engineering and so they build these large walls\nAnd one of the interesting things that I saw that they had a whole villages which were unfortunately uh said watch out a sort of the smaller residential areas and and that building them in the same place but that building among artificial the reclaimed\nA hills so I saw the biggest and they're\nPiling on lots of debt and soil and

there's a little bit of research happening hit into how they work and how to mitigate their effects\nAnd as we'll hear later on in this program scientists in other parts of the world at taking those findings and trying to test whether we could still harkens altogether but before that I Want to start with some basics wants a hurricane and how does it for them why there's so many of them here in the southern tip of the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nThey told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means we don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment her for the international university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explains how they form\nHurricane is strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans takes his energy from the warm waters with she and her kids work works the Americans the ocean as the board or and of course wind blowing around in circles turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its hustling across the Atlantic to the east coast\nThese storms stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert is tiny disturbances in the flow of whole tab that streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture as a matter for all that for what the scientists ... true\nMeteorologists always talk about her butterfly flaps its wings at home or can make it ran in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car and some of the garlic butter root for days\nAnd every one of those could turn into something\nSo you get Seventy or eighty or goes during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane or ... percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need ... to that is a very particular recipe\nNotion surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat stored in the water and that's what the hurricane lives\nThese days the focus in the U.S at least its own monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the coastline shut him or her though is the deputy director of knows hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm fury the purpose was that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide too if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening\nThat didn't necessarily work for us and uh we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast\nTo back when that started when people said oh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coats\nAnd since then we've been improving the forecasts what kinds of Tuesday you used to track how hard can we use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data overland we'd\nWe launch radio sons bitter weather balloons we have buoys out in the ocean\nOr we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane a motor they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives it sort of a reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those of thunderstorms that hurricane are\nThese pumps a really long plastic tubes with a boy at the top ... at the base and a series of vows to allow the cold water from a couple of hundred meters down to rise up which\nWe're not talking about placing this bombs in the form of his locations but the other\nIf they're white enough with a flexible tubes that can be rapidly deployed than I was thinking about maybe twenty four hours in advance of origins of all evil and follow track forecasts skill is quite good these days though we can predict quite well wherever hardly Kim is going on we can deploy\nThis massive number of wife bombs in front of the storm\nHow many pumps you reckon you'd need to deploy in the in the path of any particular hurricane and how wide an area are you talking about\nAn estimated ... to cover that region of roughly a hundred and fifty kilometers by ... you could come up with those are the palm so\nSetting up a little bit of every three hundred meters will say\nWait a little bit more so it will be young hundred fifty thousand us a hundred and ... pumps\nYeah I'd found significant of course but if we could put this bombs on a large part just maybe a thousand on one barge they essentially could be deployed very efficiently maybe by ten boats in front of the storm\nThe the big geo engineering projects and they're always consequences when you try and modify something like a weather system you worried about what\nWe know the ... approaching the lab would die anyway so what we're proposing is that we can nudge the heart of the gym before all of them for the past week um and tumor it's really not like a weather modification is just the accelerating the natural process\nAnd can I ask what agencies like NOAA think a few proposal boil\nCautious about investing significant amount of money into the research that might not lead to results then of course I Am personally strongly in favor of better ...\nBut that's the big disasters is on the boy double especially with the climate change and warming the ocean we know that ... will get more intense in the future\nAnd also because more people\nAre moving to coastal areas so we're increasingly more vulnerable in my view we should definitely think about this and we'll start with a small scale thefts immolation some more radical start is and I'm just the fact that this common sense\nNo is Shelley ... shed some ideas for stopping harkens to come up with common sense\nUh some of them I Would fare far fetched for example let's break a piece of an iceberg and put it in the Gulf of Mexico or down here in the Caribbean and call it the surface temperatures\nAh we've had people that suggest something like a bomb or and explosions to see if that will dissipate the hurricane and not make it formed\nWill we ever be able to stop the hurricane or at least tied to punch out of it\nOh don't we all wish we could stop hurricanes\nUnfortunately they are here to stay actually for some areas in the world hurricanes are typhoons\nThey're actually helpful for communities to bring a water or or refresh lakes or things like that or in the U.S and Gulf of Mexico they help to kind of Clinton's the estuaries that we have\nSo they are helpful and it says they do create a lot of damage and to what we've learned to do and what people should do is to learn how to live with them and adapt to them these are things that are always gonna be it's how Mother Nature balances

and ... do you remember the first time in ...\nUh yes she was always interested in going back to music and I think she saw in ... and I told her first husband because we're both composers and so she showed us some poetry maybe a year into our relationship\nAnd they weren't very romantic the lyrics just been really appeal to me that much\nSo and gay tell me why was he started to write quite different pet tree I met a\nSikh sense of ... and they're going to vote this don't do ... getting little got little Scott and then that the bulletin let that satisfy school you'll get a kick\nIn case you didn't catch that the Knicks what Nicole ... little skull metal your bones and that the sunshine trio rich winning gay shouldn't the lyrics to pet drink he started to get quite excited\nThese lyrics are so different from your other lyrics I mean these are perfect for deaf metal\nWe usually didn't strike he that quickly you allow yeah when I read it immediately but I was talking about worms eating your flesh after you're dying and that is the subject matter of death metal or at least black metal and she was like this method and not do that when I showed it to her [noise]\nI actually had made of just a joke stuff metal found that it's about Christmas [noise]\nAnd she loves it she said I Love it plays again [noise]\nIs it is for the day [laughter]\nAnd she says I Love that plays the

at how musical renting mayor\nI Am a classical pianist eclectic and musician and I do film using nothing to do with heavy metal whether he's the one who knows he can be electric guitar so I say well I've participated in today's as long as I just can't play the piano that way I Do which is kind of money to start [noise]\n\nSo he said don't worry this is perfect because we need to have you met all these kind of ... playing and so so I I composing Milosevic introduction then been gone through the heavy guitar and how we\nBuild the song [noise]\n\n... you had an idea as to how you still engaged should be singing on your ... what was your idea\nWell since the lyrics were so perfect for just metal I tried to make her growl like stuff about all the you know the fingers growls\nBut she was going to do that so I tried to have her things will be more traditional heavy metal and she thinks buying in June but she was just not really comfortable and so she's basically during a wrap metal kind of thing so she raps over the lurch\nPot on the capital of West seem ... province now this is a partnership between universities in Indonesia and outside the country including a academics at the University of Pittsburgh and United States\nFrom just being speaking to the professor Louis comfort who's the principal investigator on this project\nBefore we had about ... I began by asking you\nAbout the warning system that's already being put to him and was in use this weekend by the engine easy an agency for meteorology climatology and geophysics at the B. M.

issues which are hip to addressing this edition of discovery from the b._b._c. on wrote a piece\nFirst how short can we be that climate change brought about by C.

Institute for climate impact research who in twenty twelve co authored a study looking at the previous decade of extreme weather events including the European heat wave of two thousand and three still something of a climate models stern\nAnd the scorching Russian ... of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty ... twenty eleven\nClimate scientists more or less worried about links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing change and extreme weather you know with with one of these papers a contribution to that discussion actually showing that especially heat waves but also after rainfall events\nAre strongly increasing to climate change and that this was already a mini detectable observational data we have\nWith just a few years hindsight didn't crews ... paper seems well timed\nThe ... record temperatures above and the thing in recent climate history and this year is set to join them\nAlong sciences global highs a host of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also are just sick to them as they happen ... outfit will with attribution examines a European heat wave focusing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave and to what extent it has been eight more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today\nAnd so for example in Dublin it's about a one in seven years then\nAnd then we ask ... won the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without end to the climate change and then the case of Dublin leaf out it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to putting a climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely buy into the getting a climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of ... degrees were busting their records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study that lump it to remain that way\nThe further north so in the to finish places we looked at like found that if a much much of it right then and the well we live and so it was and that's how the model and it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty years then so it was a match rare event\nBut we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are all over the place and so you're uncertainties that much higher layers in this house climate change actually make this a relatively common event\nAs Freddie explains the study was based on a mixture of whether the data and climate modeling this is the managing former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise]\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where stimulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing in effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above in the current climate relatives to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from wells expert so often the is finished\nThen with cycles of review and ...\nAnd the crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen is only now taking shape we won't know what they will make twenty Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the fart up by the strongest El

this point we have pretty high confidence in those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells though does those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought\nI'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes that right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the ... is just a few weeks back\nOh well I live right\nNow all of it that way up\n\nLast week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models were suggesting we were heading for something Robert comma\nLet me issue and me uh culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea

more energy and become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at the weather diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out\nAnd that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just one particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing it extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nOr around the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds to the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the ... from the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure system that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us in the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system and there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree way residents is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporated into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will lead to be developed but if it is and Arctic warming is the driver and the news from the ice caps not good\nWe find it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global steel to emissions and to see a decline in the Arctic at least here in summer but we also see it in all of the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there is a really dominant mechanism of\nRadioactive warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor in terms of a long term trend of the ice change in the Arctic\nAnd and our two thousand sixteen paper we concluded that for every metric tons of the attitude that added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters deep sea ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of any relationships and Clinton lotta forecasts\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate of sea ice loss per increasing CEO to\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecasts of sea as conditions from climate models that there'll be a conservative and that actually will probably be seeing an ice free Arctic in summers much sooner than within levels are forecasting so according to our calculations if this many a relationship or to hold\nOver the next Twenty years we would see an Arctic Ocean that would become ice free first in September but with more to it also is that becoming ice free in August in October and it sort of extending out from there and we cheer in about Twenty years\nIf this is interesting to me by indeed and he was a policy is that has to be very alarming\nClimate scientists are currently meeting in Korea to debate won't the world might look like if nations do manage to keep average global warming below one point five degrees above\nPre industrial levels and ambitious and probably impossible target what we are learning is the worst the weather can throw jobs can be more dangerous than we imagined that the climate is reorganizing itself to amplify those was\nAfter the twenty

for each person and overtime resulted in the loss of Fifteen billion dollars of national wealth\nEquivalent to almost one year's economic activity the greatest pain as being felt in the old industrial cities in small towns where there's a great concentration of homes affected by the collapse in the mortgage market\nJeff Smith the executive director of Institute of housing studies in Chicago explains\nThe way that the foreclosure crisis in the financial crisis affected housing markets in the states is that it really started\nTo most heavily impact neighborhoods where you had a high concentration of subprime loans and you had a lot of families being evicted from their homes due to foreclosure you had a lot of vacancy and abandonment in those neighborhoods and it was really concentrated you know a lot of urban or an African American neighborhoods in cities and suburbs across the country\nSo in Chicago you got some neighborhoods where over forty percent of the housing units in those neighborhoods were hit by at least one foreclosure over the foreclosure crisis\nThat house itself was likely abandoned and overvalued so in many cases the value of the mortgage was much greater than the actual value of the property causing blight in many neighborhoods in Chicago and other parts of the country\nI also Jeff what happened to these people\nForeclosure is a negative event on your credit score credit scores are very you know significant numbers of these days and when lots of people make decisions on not just if you can get a loan\nOr for a car or for a mortgage for a credit card but also use if you can get a job you if you can get a apartments\nSo it was a big event that hill a significant effect not just on where they live but also options going forward\nIn the U.S the crisis has skewed homeownership to older borrows with strong credit ratings homeownership rates for the under forty five substance sharply since the crash\nOver forty percent of housing wealth is now held by the over sixties compared to only of course it before the crash Flora and middle income families and young people have not benefited from the increasing housing values in recent years\nJust highlights the extent to which the diverging fortunes of the property market led to increased inequality\nThe economy at least for a certain components of the economy has improved and you see investments coming into the city but that's really only touching maybe a third to half of of the city neighborhoods and the rest of the city is continuing to struggle and really hasn't recovered\nFrom the financial crisis the neighborhoods still lack investments the families who lived their struggle for finding employment and for double housing\nSo I think what you've seen in Chicago in the I think what you've seen it a lot of cities is growing tale of two cities where the fortunes of the rich and the folks who have resources that have been getting a better on the fortunes of the folks who\nAre struggling and are getting worse\nThe growing inability of low income people to sell their homes and move the dynamic cities with a new job search we found combined with

having deficits and even more if you have to spend a lot of money to bail out the banks\nHistorically there have been many instances where government seeing that deficit say that deficit will result in a loss of confidence\nWe have to get rid of the deficit the way you get rid of the deficit is cut back expenditures which is called us therapy or raise taxes but actually really hard to do the
