attacking like preexisting conditions\nI think there are definitely some Republican activist who will want to finish the job now that John McCain has been replaced and the Senate by a more reliable vote for the Republican agenda but Danielle is right there will also certainly be some wariness given the backlash they've gotten already\nAnd if for Republicans gained some seats in the Senate ah three Republicans wouldn't be able to stop or repeal effort like they did this year That's NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben thank you very much you could we would [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow so every week we focus on one race and we already talked about the Georgia governor's race in the show but here's the thing is just a week and a half left before election day a lot of big races to talk about\nSo this week we're going to add a second race of the week and to do that we've got to ... months in our old NPR hate America hey there and we're gonna bring bread jasper's of member station ... in Phoenix hey Brad hey hey so dumb ethical let's start with you catch us up to speed who's running in this race why does it matter\nWhat no matter who wins here the Arizona Senate races going to make history is elected eleven senators since becoming a state Nineteen twelve\nNone of them though have been a woman and that's definitely going to change this November that because voters here will either elect democratic representative cures to send them a\nShe's a former social worker or Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally she's retired from the military with the rank of colonel and she was the first woman to fly in combat\nThis just for the seat that's being vacated by Jeff Flake who decided not to run again because he said he just couldn't see myself getting elected given on the Republican Party has gone one way and and he is gone the other way Brett what is the strategy that that makes Sally and send them are taking into this campaign what if they both been focusing on well\nBoth of them have tried to really make themselves to some degree cinemas project of remaking has lasted many years she was in the state legislature in a very\nProgressive member of that years ago and she's been one of the most moderate members of the house of representatives in Congress whereas makes Sally also started off as a moderate congresswoman but in this campaign she's really embrace President Trump\nSeparate we could really say this for for most Senate races at this point in an election but this has gotten\nReally negative while we were in harm's way in uniforms kissing cinema was protesting us any pink too to\nSome extent always seem to think she can sway whatever she wants as long as she shows a picture of herself in uniform show by just to get a link to show why about anything\nAnd it missed all this what are you hearing from the actual voters that you talk to\nPeople talk about the ads um they they are disgusted by them you know one particular voter you know it was really striking she didn't want to give me her name but she said that she drives two hours a day on her commute and she fears these ads on the radio\nOh my God those ads are horrible absolutely horrible\nHonestly it reminds me as petty school ground catty girl just yelling at each other so I just prefer to distance myself from that\nSo you might not vote in that race because of that fact was talking to a a political scientist here who said she wasn't sure if that was a strategy by makes Sally but\nYou know the people who might be turned off from voting are people who are a less likely to vote in the first place and the women and so those might both be constituencies here since ... what meat so you know the negative ads are definitely having an effect especially if they're like irrelevant to you know important salient issues\nYou know people like to say that negative ads don't work in that they don't like negative ads but the thing is negative ads do work\nOn the fact of the matter is that cinema was leading in these polls her favorability ratings were much higher\nAnd there's a reason why she is now a started to to lose some ground and it's all because of those ads and by the way if anybody is annoyed with those ads and you're in the car listening to the radio what are you doing not listening to NPR [laughter]\nJasper's

I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eight Nineteen Seventy three for young people do they seem to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up to tenants and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah I've killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after you had the four people died\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear\nClearly and um\nThey heard

long time maybe twenty five to life and pedophiles prison you have to be careful things get rough\nBut they tell him if you talk to us maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity that was only two friends to help get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a person that was the goal to have anything to say say you know\nIt took several conversations the get go to this point but

[noise]\nIsn't that was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned earlier cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information\nLay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of the year when we back up do\n\nEventually ... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued was a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's see how that played that out what what are your options sure so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't\nWe took her to know to keep the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nAre trying to find these girls he knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive you are\nYou're questioning yourself very\nYou're hurting people so you begin to wonder um are you in the right profession you know you're looking for and you're looking for a way to give the information\nYou know will make us none of them was coal\nSure\nWell [laughter] if I'm gonna do it and we'll do it openly\nNo ah I don't know\nDid he ever did he ever break\nKnow according to him now you know in my mind was doing what I thought was a proper a circle legal Morrow moral\nThing to do and then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girls disappear their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other students bodies discovered by two kids were playing up in the minds a leash a um I guess it's I think a student from Syracuse University which is right next door to the\nCemetery as walking through and and stumbled upon her and so she has discovered than to and then six months later\nSummer of Nineteen Seventy four opening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though Robert ... trial for the\nMurder of bill ... begins Romneycare as primary line of defense or apparently the not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decided to do is to put ... on the stand and you\nJust get the facts and Guerra would tell his whole life story drew a shock the jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes to see those even look at the time he was nuts Sharon Smith gentle six news in like ...\nSo the trial opens um the courtroom is jam packed prosecution starts they have a really good case they've got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County and then it's time for the defense to start their case\nTo Belgium stands up and he called his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand Guerra gets an stand and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible\n[noise] severe beatings and abused by parents very little education basically gets\nSent off to a farm to work like as an indentured servitude when he's seven you know slaughtering bulls and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he started drinking blood I'm having sex with the animals and then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult life and he admitted to killing\nAlicia and Susan and what happens next and nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when Garrett was talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian Armani hold a press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nFor bars without Robert does the ... because they had a duty to protect our clients secret for regular the broader worker but\nEveryone is disgusted those columns written editorials written letters to the auditors\nAre just no way in the world you're going from your average non lawyer everybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby some version of the law of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that our money and Dell jihad actually tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of law does our money was getting death threats in the\nMail them are just as for the phone call people calling and saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you at one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard you started to carry a pistol my bag he kept shock on in the car he kept on in the house so we could\nSleep it was that was the worst moment to move or [noise] or some horrible for\nHis book it's\nJune twenty seventh Robert ... rose convicted for the murder of Philip bump whiskey he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life than a maximum security prison how ... how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nBut then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they should bring against the two attorneys\nPretty soon after the verdict our money and build you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nState public health law and the tradition that says that a body must be given quick in decent burial and on top of that\n... ... is a group of career where\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarming an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nAlgae started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice moved to Florida or body toughed it out but he suffered\nA no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or was that you know what else can\nI Do to make a living\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... all all the stress and pressure churches to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar the Belgian or money did\nWas write what they did was good exactly\nAccording to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nA ... I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp and I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and and talking to law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do this is what a lawyer she should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go on the record but we email and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay you're okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine\nYou know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "27"}
