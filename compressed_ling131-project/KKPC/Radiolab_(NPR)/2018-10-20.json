{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "Do you still think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that is man made I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions intrusions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nDo we have a sense of you know really that the real tangible side effects of this\nSo the idea is by not pursuing climate change your protect these coal jobs even if you don't bring them all back but then there's also this idea that if you make energy more expensive\nThan people will have to pay more companies that rely on a lot using a lot of energy will have to Jack up their prices it's like what you hear about the terrorists that may raise prices on consumer is basically the same thing that you'll raise prices on consumer and therefore consumers will have to ...\nWell yeah it's just an interesting thing though because I mean really what this is is it's it's a debate about I mean for sure if we were to address climate change tomorrow right let's just say that the Trump Administration somehow woke up tomorrow and said hey we actually think climate change Israel we want to do something about it in the short term for sure there would be job loss or it'd be economic loss just because\nYou know that would require a complete\nChange a mark on the way things work but\nWhen you look at the implications of not doing anything I mean\nIt's hard to put a number on the future right it's hard to know\nExactly what the effects of climate change you're going to be and how much it would cost but I mean the the research that has come out as saying it's going to cost trillions and truly into trillions of dollars parts of the country and parts of the world are going to be unlivable right so there are some really big issues\nThat you're you're just kind of kicking down the road and at some point somebody's gonna have to pay that cost if we're not paying it right now\nSo let's talk a little bit about what is the civically at stake in the midterms right if the Republicans keep Congress do we get a sense that anything would change would things be kind of acts but I did that we've seen in terms of the Trump administration's um rejection of climate change your gender\nOr India a lot of what you've seen right if you think about the Obama administration if you think about the Trump Administration is doing right now in terms of environmental policy almost everything that's happening is in the executive branch right Congress has not they're not really doing anything\nThey haven't for a long time when it comes to the environment\nToday on the flip side than if Democrats are who do seem to see this as a pressing issue right now right politically you\nAre hearing Democrats talk a little bit more about climate change and some of the threats they hear from the Republican opponent so if Democrats were to take control even if one chamber of the house I mean what could they do too I mean beyond say oversight\nThat's about it every Democrat I talked to said oversight oversight oversight which you know we shouldn't be what does that mean exactly are you hearing you know expect to see Ryan Zinke key uh Andrew wheeler the head of the EPA\nRuns it could be in the head of the interior um you know you would expect to see those guys are in hearings over and over and over again where they'd be having to come up and explain a lot of the robots that they're doing explain why they've\nGot rid of the mess and ruled explain you know the spending cuts for climate science that NASA or those sort of things where it makes it very difficult for them do their jobs because they're basically having to spend all their time preparing for hearings and took a potentially slowed down the process you're saying\nYeah could slow down the process you know there was another interesting thing that uh you know Tom pile who is with the American energy alliance very supportive of Trump's agenda you said it would actually also give Democrats an environmental groups are staged too you know crafting narrative that that hasn't really gotten out there right now against what Trump is doing with the environment\nUm which I thought was really interesting you said there's just so much other news happening that environment issues really haven't you know taken center stage um and it would give them an opportunity to actually really to craft that narrative and put it out there\nThat's basically what the Republicans did on climate change under President Obama when they took over the house\nThey would be bringing in a you know the EPA administrators and others and basically kinda yell at them and say you're going to put a tax on all these weird heard all these people they were they use that to frame their narrative and make any climate change action seem like it is a tax and it's going to hurt\nAlright well thank you to you both NPR's Ayesha Rascoe and eat raw thank you\nAnd this is the

culture and personal stories that reflect the impact that news has on our daily life in Colorado here\nColorado news every day on Colorado Public radio news or ... you\nKnow and\nListening to radio lab radio from W and why [noise]\n[noise] hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping\n[laughter] so we ... we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to measure went on it yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young to middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling from St Louis nursing\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point [noise]\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to\nFace but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud but to face with rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say and what we can't save by like ... what we\nAnd then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for every oh can we go through some sort of the ridiculous example\nWe let's over here today so Gore Gore you mean violence kinda Gore yes so the Gore standard was\nHeadlined we don't allow graphic violence and Gore and then the shorthand definition they used was no insides on the outside no\nGuts no blood pouring out of something blood was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule to\nCome up with rules about bodily fluids seeming for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does a clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked people that were paintings or sculptures come up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in this can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal made out of stone really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like is this what you can see with your eyeballs\nAnd so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly updated constant amendment yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule\nIn fact at this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month\nWow really take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed the attachment clots said the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nibble at the woman oh and in fact\nA one nipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that both nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nWho did what happens in American law all the time it's very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law [noise] so common law is\nThe system dating back to early England where individual judges would make a ruling which would sort of\nBe a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges the body of law was sort of constantly flashed out in the seventies fact [noise]\nLiterally every time this team that Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight ... some things are going to show up that they that they weren't prepared for that and that's a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about this\nFor example some time around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nThat [noise] the jak [noise] ... [noise] kept\nAnd she comes upon this image in\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressed in skin breast feeding a goats of baby goats and the moderator throws their hands up and says what gives this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was the thing it turns out it's a survival practice\nAccording to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought unknown way to help your herd get through the drought is to uh if you if you have a woman whose life dating to have her nurse the kid the baby goat along with her human kit\nAnd so there's nothing sexual about it's good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant it it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue that but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple\nBut [noise] but obviously breastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment and ask direct under the rules stating animals are not babies we added that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they removed they they they did was I was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo\nYet that outraged individuals are editors foreign wheeler why why did we make an exception\nSo basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nAll of this is like the ... ah it's too dangerous to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHas exploited to you know get squashed by attached to you know people will cages in drowsy cherry like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with an eight year old boy it's just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did this\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up and ah he\nCut yourself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were there was such a like it is but I couldn't watch it was while I think Clinton's ... ... us it was like okay like ... like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I'd have to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nJust means literally nothing [laughter] give us an example\nOf this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers\nCab driver would be the non protected modify or because employment is not protected category and so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion we would allow it\nBecause we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected\nCategory of black mhm and so children Trump's black their child miss Trump's their blackness you can say whatever I Want about black children\nWhereas in the case of white men or you've got a you've got gender and race\nBoth protected you can attack them\nThat's just a bizarre rule I Would think you'd go the other direction to the protected class would\nOutweigh the modified well they they made this decision as they explain to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition\nAnd so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend is a valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we'd say this is so bad we're going to take it down and in this case\nTheir concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected categories like we all have gender we all have sexual orientation\nAnd if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech what you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone\nOn Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right no matter where\nWe draw the line there are going to be some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle that they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they consider the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is\nInto consideration but despite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough there are not systematic efforts to eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech makes sense well\nYeah because you sort of hate speech a or thinking about hate speech\nThere's this idea of of privileged or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection a because of being historically disadvantaged ... ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nWith Japanese reinforce in the Nineteen forties front off the side\nYou had Japanese soldiers tens of thousands of Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two [noise]\nAt the same time you had Japanese American citizens\nThan a hundred thousand persons of Japanese ancestry all would have to move\nBeing put into internment camps\nAnd so we had to ask ourselves a question like are the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story and this happened at the exact same moment so you've got to different places to different cultural stories\nIn ... when you have a website like Facebook this transnational community\nThey realized they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond that there is no way\nTo have actually William way and consider who is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege\nOr into the equation at all Mm Mm Mm\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here in American these moderators only have like four or five seconds for Republicans come to make a decision\nAnd Indian and even in those\nFour seconds is there enough time to to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given IP address can easily be math will go back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person ethnicity why Jill during our values on black children\nAre on top of that we often don't know an individual's race strange people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of tests and we saw some times that it was just too hard for viewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nAnd converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses\nThat that um that's the tension here\n\nAnd I just want to\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently\nThat it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white rule but\nWhen we come back those rules they toppled\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing
