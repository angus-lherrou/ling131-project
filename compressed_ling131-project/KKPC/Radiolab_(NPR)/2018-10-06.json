Robert Krulwich radiolab and today too\n[noise] [noise] it's going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times\nWe've had on the show before and say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think is good right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started to the game is what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national story [noise] there was a lot of belly aching and press how many people do we see killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire and\nSamir rice and Harris than to budge on her and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble and processing that like number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented Brazil\nBurst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think ... and three hundred and eighty eight emails to asking for five years worth of paper\nAny paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people\nEven even daughter to be silent and in fact when I spoke to one of those women you just heard at one with the way to get in touch with Clemens or twenty three year old son Roger Mitchell he was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop we're actually going to get into that story later but she\nTold me that I've met about four hundred other mothers they reached out to me and I were a hundred oh yeah really yeah through like traveling around through Facebook of ... other mothers who've lost their children wow [noise]\nSo I was just seemed like a fraction of that at this community center got the scales uprising ray and the other thing for me was how you see these stories\nPop up thirty seven year old Alton Sterling forty year old parents ... I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come\nOut and man when children they oppose the only thing that they need [noise]\nFor like two days you see them on television\nThat they that do with my twin brother that big bad dude was a father\nThen they kind of recede\nThey're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happened is they get like folded up into this network\nThe ... the little determines with his family\nAnd so at the center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big round dining tables because\nOnce upon a time of all there were ...\nThere was no winners ... wants to do with little who parental\nHoliday shows on Harlem is or is it hot dogs and our levels\nWe're ... for low for the students\nAnd so after the prayer Christel House him back in the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nThe ... totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic tables\nMine just uh I mean I'm not going to make not one that I don't know no no no comment which is where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was wondering for early don't you just described for me what we got on the table because I'm just a one thing to have you had to for some I mean the cable writer so I think you have to have your own\nIf you get to ask you got your Britain and you've got to bake it you've got your thought you got everything you're going to have to get nice good he pulled out of the day\nI got to get your name show in Geneva Greenville I'm the mother Sandra Bland and keeps you don't remember [noise]\nTrials holders for something that you didn't\nSenior plan is pulled over in a small town in Texas the cop runs or information comes back to the car mine for not your cigarettes please\nOr low you don't have it right out of the car not have the right to do that I Do have the right now more removed I don't get her a mold for us now for our movie I'm giving you a lawful order\nFor\nUs\nIt was meant to be seen it gets out of the car but you know you're doing all this weird over\n\nMuch\nSandra was eventually taken in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found dead\nHang with the plastic garbage bag the death is real the suicide and singers family disputed that ruling\nYou've got everything you want to have to get nice good full all day\nI got to get your name\nTo read from earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it in terms of how we see each other head on the couch you know a metric as it becomes like a huge sleep over\nIn first before the secret of talking you know getting to know each other you know some are the vice shows results like therapy for\n... ... pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me I Believe we're at a ...\nAnd it was when was the lead some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlene was hit by that squad cars like about twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy brat so\nWe usually the video that we can we just came down video that's that's the\nSame time my\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nCame in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause the guardian was here in ...\nAnd I think in a you know I've read a lot about implicit bias and now it seems like um like it just feels like a kinder way to say here like fear of a black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop when\nYou look at some of the shootings you record on video and I and I think of the poorer school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota oh yeah the clinic steel shooting yeah there's a guy who told the officer in do uncertain terms I'm a good guy\nI have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo with the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason\nThat officer threat level with a baby in the car\nAnd I got a guy in his ... his kid his girlfriend according to a gun permit older this is this is an easy car stuff for some reason and and the reason is because of the color of the main skin all those things never registered black Irish shippers by his pocket unless you and and I would like to tell you and all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be now even tell you\nThat we don't you don't want people and the twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation cop I'm appalled at what I see on those videos I could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control some of the my understanding what's going on I mean wrestling underground for your life and you and and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly ...\nBut the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me and you're looking at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already\nOperating with this level of heightened fear or this perceived threat in my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using it real life scenarios\nThat take that extra split second before you fired your weapon and I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people\nAt a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled removed you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had to reach reach trained on how to keep your finger on the site plate the weapon not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you would have thought it was Armageddon oh my God they're gonna get killed on reality what it did was it slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second to make a difference that blood given I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your knock shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been\nThat the color of my glass coming out my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again is this idea of time\nIn certain situations slow down when you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down\nLike whatever you can do use covered just creates in space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found this out also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that some police chiefs don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because everything that there was this text allowed\nUs only know how to communicate it's like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and and I'm Serious about whether the drive through at McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that you talk to different police chief who told him the young people who are\nComing into the Academy of past years have never been in a physical fight\nWhich the problem because when they get into a fight their hearts touched the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and they're way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons\nUh you know to to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten\nUp on you know so that then says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bounces or for chip what he said\nFrom just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the\nPolicy basically know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff over they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day you have to get to know people yeah for\nSure and so to make this point it would get up walking down the hall to another office\nHad sent me down on the computer the sounds of us when we say OK showed me this video to video starts\nIn Thailand and in the body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car and he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as you said is a partner both cuts are white also it's night so\n[noise] cause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people he's off his meds I think he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly they park flow neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nFrom this shirtless black guy engines show out there\nThat's the kind of talking him copper in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty big negative than any walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body can pulls out a taste of the other officers out it was added a frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nI wrote it down is approaching approaching approaching a protein and you get to them like ten feet of the cops and then\n[noise]\nThe guy would find campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got his gun out he was over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she changed central four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you're\nLucky you didn't just shy shy about to get shot I say if you want to die if you want to die [laughter] you can't die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\n[laughter] a fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for\nWhat it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that\nYou might have just instinctively reacted thinking I was a gunshot and fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior\nContact read I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek\nJust a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nIt's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him\nBut because of that knowing that officer because of that in establish some kind of poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood that I mentioned on the front step ... what are you doing man dared does stupid set up a bit you don't have close came to be in that wouldn't be back with his medication wasn't doing drugs and he was ... ... me and you are right you\nKnow again uh almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last night's primary election among the winners Daytona ... he is now militias county sheriff like she would was elected sheriff of Linn county\n[noise]\nWhich is the county that the tone of each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a chip on his organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nBig coalition of bleach have a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being some being law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "06"}
