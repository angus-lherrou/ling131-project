Johnson out long before hers so there there was a a a platform that Kim car dash and was elevating\n[noise] so I think this is all very interesting and I'm gonna let you finish\nWould figure let me see if\nI Want to say I had one of the most viral political moments of all time this week\nAnd that gives him applauds that was awesome if that was that was great great they said that was like\nA little cold back to the what two thousand nine be amazed when you're awesome\nDo you think you so if you know one of the two percent of people who are unfamiliar with this story let me just give you a quick recap uh on Sunday night Taylor Swift who has been famously apolitical posted a photo on her Instagram\nAnd she had a pretty political captured she more or less came out as being a Democrat thing she could not vote for someone who wouldn't necessarily\nFight for all Americans and take into account people's race and gender or sexual orientation she also endorsed feel bread is and and the tendency Senate race that's the Democrat running and came out against the Republican Marsha Blackburn\nWas incredibly notable because\nShe has been extraordinarily apolitical and a lot of people were wondering and the twenty sixteen election why she didn't chime in and you know and I have my own theories about you know do we really need singers are actors or sports stars to be political but\nPretty much like everybody else weight in I mean Katy Perry fiance everybody was like doing concerts for Hillary and Taylor Swift was silent I think a lot of people assume maybe she was a Republican evil\nAnd you know there's been some let's say series that after she posted this on Instagram she has over a hundred million followers on Instagram that that there was some sort of up taking voter registration you know we can debate whether or not that is entirely true or if registration always sees an up tick just a couple of days before the deadline\nBut I mean look at the end of the day there is some indication that they're that a lot of young people were registering they let these last couple of days and and I love the belief that Taylor Swift who is noticeably been very quiet if you suddenly start seeing somebody who you are a big fan of post about it it might have made some people reconsider\nYeah I mean I'm sure she got some people to register I'm sure there are some young voters and Tennessee who maybe weren't paying attention to the race who now suddenly were but I mean ascribing any kind of real political power to a celebrity endorsement always makes me a little queasy and I you know kind of\nDon't necessarily think that there's a huge influence from that person and and sometimes they can really backfire frankly I mean\nI Know that brought us and embraced this endorsement but\nAt the same time her endorsement was kind of a pretty partisan endorsement you had to do with ... writes for example um I'm not so sure for someone like Brett is and that's the whole message that he wants to embrace because\nHe is running as a pretty nonpartisan guy there's a lot of people in Tennessee you don't even know Bredesen is a Democrat he was governor there and uh you know putting a celebrity or as a face of\nAs part of your campaign essentially you know that can be polarizing for a lot of people who may not have even realize that you were a Democrat in the first place though I think\nFor younger voters eh LGBTQ rights is not really a partisan issue in the\nWay when I'm Talking about younger voters necessarily right I mean we're talking about Tennessee you know middle of the road a older voters the kinds of people who actually do vote in elections\nBut there is some talk that younger people are showing enthusiasm levels that are not traditionally what we see in the mid term elections so they might surprise us all\nAll we can say is that there's some bad blood between Taylor\nAnd Republicans as maybe Marsha Blackburn just wants to shake it off really telling them that that was pretty mediocre but it's all I got four is laughing York everyone [laughter] I'm does\nThis whole thing with loaded [noise]\n[noise]\nThose were the things that we can't let go of we will continue this conversation about Taylor Swift off line this is the politics show from NPR and we're here every weekend with a special broadcast leading up to the midterm election\nWe'll be breaking down the major themes issues and races playing out this year and as the news keeps happening all week long you can keep up with our podcast the NPR politics podcast\nTo get the inside scoop on the biggest political stories right if they happen on camera Keith I covered the White House\nAnd I ...

have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years\nIt put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy tax and all of a sudden\nOne day that home popped into his mind and I said oh there's a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what I meant was to\nInto something that we referred to as one thing [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nWe should say we looked into it and there are actually two pictures that show but he's kind of scaling above three can't really tell him that [noise] you know smiles\n[noise] caught on may ... ...\nA a ...\nBono me she'll be in you know\nE E\nYeah same same young mom dad\nBought a Mac Donald\nLesson number two are you just talking or are you doing to rocket

based in Nairobi round seven thirty in the name of the things I just told you good morning and so he um [laughter] but I forgot how to say good evening so oh okay\nSo great I mean we were just a [laughter] anyhow [laughter] we called Greg out because he had written this article for this great website called ... dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about uh the failure to communicate I could tell you that story that you are yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it is and translate of all but it's the word serious\nWhen did you get is like you're in a serious ... us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this where serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern\nIt actually almost never has something to do with your mood\nFor serious tends to me is are you just talking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bribe oh usually I Pretend misunderstand if they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um but the story that I Want to tell you as\nGood afternoon everybody I'm I'm really pleased to be a doctor in Africa Secretary Kerry is out of a visited Ethiopia and for the norm is energy and just a few\nDays before carry visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and Secretary Kerry was given this press conference I shared my concerns about a young age the opium blogger that I met last year a ...\nWho ah with age of his peers I've been in prison and I firmly believe that the work of journalists whether it's print journalists are in the Internet or media law because it makes societies stronger\nYou know that all the things you do you expect him to say said we believe that free speech and open dialogues important to the economic development of country pop up law but\nWe remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia with this comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise of Ethiopia and\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carry credit\nAnd in any way no but I have his phone number so I can give them a call in and sign up\n\nAnd I and many exits Gregory Gregory Warner oh legal the audience and good I'm good I\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nWell I started learning not to get them together to them in the Arctic shipping and that\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah\nThese messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this if you will be an anti terrorism task force will wage social media tax by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\n... on the theater and he's in trouble for out of the ones that are saying these kinds of relief\nAnd were they threatening yeah\nSome over there where you know in some skiing in the dark I mean the French Dakota being the one good thing comes\nAnd it might come one day\nA newspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nLife safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brothers that are being your your it's Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry yeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that ... what is your mom say\nSo do you\nDo find little no well I'm\nNot going to do and I mean do you do\nIn Yankee Doodle again do you do\nLesson number four imagine a lot of Coca Cola like bubbles or your Tom ... going to be on the profit now you're try [noise]\n\nPretty good this is Emily Emily got CNN I'd asked\n[noise]\nSomeone you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily where she'd been hit by truck\nGone into a coma and her boyfriend at the time Alan or had brought her back my writing on her hands [noise]\n[noise]\nWell the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most response and when we left that story Emily had emerged from the moment again to recover\nBut she was blind totally\nBlind right yeah and like no light any nothing coming in now okay needless to say\nWas a very big adjustment I just know I just had to develop my own ways to\nNavigate throughout the world and chest myself and\nAnd being a visual artist she had to develop new ways to draw\nI had ... and if you ... it's hard enough you can feel a little wax on the paper [noise] um yeah\nBut then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call from the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah it's a school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology\nI think they were doing this study for the FDA\nVery experimental among thunder a long story short a Emily shows up to the White House school one day and walks into this room and a guy named ed gives her this thing he get his device can you describe it I mean is it a big moment no\nIt's not it's just say and regular pair of sunglasses\nThough they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says 'cause right on the front like on the bridge and the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attach to the sunglasses was a little wire\nThat ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing is made are titanium and it's just say the size of a postage stamp or a little bit thicker though\nThat explained her the little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square plays it on your time put it right on the center of your tongue\nAnd cause your mouth\nSo I put it on and they\nTurned it on 'em and it was like is there is to take all imagine a lot of Coca Cola like a lot of levels on your town and always like frankly regularly and feeling\nThe idea behind this thing called a science writer same gene author of detail of doing or oh surgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes might seem like our eyes are doing ... years and during the hearing in her fingers in ...\nBut that's actually not how words each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerds and it is the brain than convergence of little glimpse into what you perceive as a site or sound or smell no obviously\nSomeone who was blind to the retina is not sending those signals anymore but what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brains\nIn all of our brains there lots and lots of pathways going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist like there's a road there but it's shut down in traffic can be on it\nBut what if you could open up some of those rough\nAnd he just let me say with an eye for an hour two hours\nEmily says at first she had no idea what was happening she would just as with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change and\nEvery time I looked around he said oh that's a chair that door that's me\nThat's your mom and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square of plastic and Anna and nothing was really happening for except for the perfectly feelings on her tongue\nBut then there was this moment add had this really long Styrofoam rod\nAnd the last day in front of me he moved it up and down in front of my face [noise] and ... oh my God what was that [noise] suddenly she says she just thought it was like oh my God [laughter] it just happened\nI I don't what did it look like in so many mind's\nEye it looks like a long white skinny stick did you see the texture of the sticker um\nNo I couldn't see texture I couldn't see in three dimensions it was very flat it's kind of like that kid's toy light right\nYeah they're alleging like a black screen and little tiny white dots\nAll arranged in a line\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain port device for about a year and a half and during that time the light right resolution of it did get better as her brain learn to speak to him it was awesome\nWhen I saw people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it's semi showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street she told me they usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially of town where the streets are lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me I feel like\nI'm just walking\nI can always hear the topic and the sounds of traffic sites\nBut she says which with a device on and put a sensor undertone the sidewalk\n[noise] came alive [laughter] I thought it was amazing like I didn't know how many people are on the street at the same time they have to now they're um [noise] they're all there again would you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting like\nReally stopped watching everything that sounds nice soft wrong is as you\nCan move 'em\nThey're walking and I can see their life living and I could see them their gate but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see their featured or whether they're wearing a shirt or shorts or\nAddress [noise] has a just like see their shadows and every now and and I see the light counted on them really yeah\nI've mentioned some like underwater creatures uh-huh squishy jelly fish like yeah\nYeah ... yeah [laughter]\n\nAnd that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is a hazy sea of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine [noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] we were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain port and you can check that out by
