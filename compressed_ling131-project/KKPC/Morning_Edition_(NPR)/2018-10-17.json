it's led\nBy a conservative activist who has no past to charge the college efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move wash U of the New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line to mourning\nMourning how widespread is Asian Americans skepticism about anything that is seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian American still Barclay port affirmative action but the um the group that I talked to represent\nA growing and very vocal faction and powered by social media out by their own and diligent an organizer they'd had quite an effectively and affecting the ...\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\n[noise] well they they're very much into a kind of numbers should mission or a coach or admissions that isn't actually often exercise reality but\nAre they view the quote unquote penalty tort Asian students um in category like personal ranking a very subjective rank harbored offers as artists advantageous Asian American\nOr you say numbers base to do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be the be all and end all\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to create a ... a because a lot of them are a newer immigrants from mainland China or testing is very much a make or break way of social mobility\nOr they do believe that the test scores that Asian Americans get should count for more than I Am shocked features like leadership or I'm I'm a personal rankings\nIs this debate any different if we move away from it all the university like Harvard to a less elite university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around a hundred action has whittled down to this question of Harvard because Harvard\nIs an unusual execution here suggesting um when we look at work play a job hiring contracting a lot of people even American include are very supportive of kind of action so it's really provides a skewed way go at ... issue at all\nNo okay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks I talked it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before um linking up with Edward Blum so you\nKnow they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they want to do all along to be able to partner with something someone like Rick blooms sort of serendipitous for both sides\nVery briefly what is it we're bloom the activists give them that they wouldn't

Rosen president of as some research is here to walk us through the numbers hey Larry good morning\nSo Larry we've been tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten in any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them by well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickled down to them any individual such as they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tasks that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important than having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for goods but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by America campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of a sudden their paycheck isn't going as far as they thought it was before\nAnd we also saw this kind of ... hierarchy maybe in terms of the priorities people had when it comes to tear tell me about that\nRight so we asked what's more important in different pairs and one pair we asked about was what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintaining good relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies was more important than protecting us jobs\nOr by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low costs on on consumer goods but I

they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates to muck so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen and some people think that's more than ... needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells you to budget committee hearing last month\nThe soaring deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements\nBut one thing or that jumped out in this most recent reporters that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out in ... is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other\nUh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt was very disturbing image is driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here does he have a point\nWell I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong it's Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty\nPercent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending is the society ages\nOver the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them\nIn my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time David Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote\nIn Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls and then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand six team\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra ... of member station WFSU\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be inside early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires\nAll sites within a county to be open from ... to ... pm during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites that selection\nEarly but he was very popular and gets to county and and\nI Would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are British Sherry responsibility to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights in a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring a June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has been prefer and has been referred by a certain population and certain populations who's right to vote as not all live in our life but it's been rejected in a recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen lot that among other things cut early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision that Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the Jim debate\nWhat we set out would be an issue to do is to be able to make you or reliable and the ... dog voters would know that the early voting sites or sites and their county was open from ... I'm In the morning to sit on the evening\nThe law has some bipartisan opposition run riot is the Republican Party chair of the ... county about fifty miles north of Charlotte the county has had to cut its early voting sites in half\nFrustrated as to where to go with ...\nAnd he says even though this may not seem like an unfunded mandate\nThat's exactly what it translates to being at the end of the day\n... counties with smaller election budgets like ... are disproportionately affected by this change well individual locations maybe open longer they released Seventeen percent fewer sites this election MIT political scientist Charles Stuart that third says that for voters convenience Trump's hours\nAnd there's a lot of research that's been done that suggests that whenever you move a polling place further away from a voter that are less likely to vote there\nStewart says the real change could simply shift turn out to election day which could mean longer lines at the polls in his state or voting rights have become such a political hot potato elections officials say they just go with the flow Becky Gallup Harris the elections director in ... county\nDue to court cases legislation all of that kind of thing factors in and it just seems like we always had some from each other and that\nTakes us in a different direction\nTo question remains voters adapt as easily\nFor NPR News I'm Alex ...

have met the crown prince Mohammed bin ... you've interviewed more than once at least once this year as a matter of fact when you hear of these accusations that the crown prince himself could have been involved in ordering the murder of this man do you say yeah that sounds plausible\nHe uh combines two thinks she is a real change agent he does want to change Saudi Arabia place that needs change\nOr any accomplish some of those changes he's reduce the role of the road just places a lot of women to drive and given women additional writes ah he's provided more open public at our team and the McCain them those are good things are ... who who was our ... our columnist or a dissident critic\nCredited NBS as he's called for for all those things he has a dark side\nPersonality in the very first piece I wrote about him after meeting for the first time the headline was ... the prince who could jumpstart Saudi Arabia or drive it off a cliff and both elements are present in him in ... in this latest\nInstance ah with the ... disappearance I I fear we're seeing the impulsive hothead\nWho could who could wreck the kingdom it's important for Saudi Arabia first of all the facts be clarified here no one is going to invest in the kingdom in in ways that are desperately needed to to make it the more modern place that MPs wants\nIn till there is a clear accounting of what happened to democracy ... they're not going to get the investors they're not going to get the support so they had they had the biggest interest if anybody\nUh although the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is not going to indict himself was a plausible outcome here that could also a stabbed which the facts at a credible\nWay so when you have a incidents like this and they're often as a call for an international investigation that was done in the case of Rafiq Hariri the prime minister of Lebanon who was assassinated\nIt was believed by Iranian backed elements in in Lebanon so the un sponsored a ... an international inquiry to establish the facts\nBecause of the growing numbers of journalists are under attack I think this would be an appropriate case for an international investigation I don't know exactly how it will be done but that would be my preference that may be impossible here but I think the role the U.S has to insist that the investigation be transparent be aggressive be serious and not be a cover up is\nThe best hope for the U.S point of view that the Saudis would punish some underlings for this\nThe best hope is that all the facts of how this happened to come out and the worst outcome I think would be you know a convenient scapegoat that seems to resolve the issue what we know in my reporting this morning the Washington Post and for the New York times reporting this morning is in my piece\nLast summer a Mohammed bin some on the crown prince a ordered his aides to bring back to the kingdom democracy ... and other dissidents he he put out that order unfortunately the U.S didn't learn of it until after his disappearance October second New York times reported this morning you very importantly that\nFour of the of the people who can be done to fight and

identified and photographs standing right next to the crown prince at events in\nIn Houston in Boston and the grid and Paris so there is hard evidence to say this is connected to the man at the top\n[noise] okay so what would make the Trump Administration so eager to I don't want to say cover up we don't know that's where it's going but so eager to sound supportive of Mohammed bin Salman in this circumstance why does President Trump and why would the United states need the Saudis so\nMuch Trump himself a son in law Jared Kushner had made a big bet on the success of a mob of it's been

election in Colorado history by a wide margin donors have contributed almost one hundred Ninety million dollars to individual campaigns with about three weeks to go before election day\nCPR is Ben Marcus has been following the money and he joins me now Ben why have so much money being spent on this election really comes down\nTo two groups the oil and gas industry and Jared polish and both of those groups are breaking records just by themselves\nOkay the oil and gas industry they are fighting a battle on like two different\nFronts right yes it was interesting because they're supporting one measure of this would basically if it passes would force governments to compensate them for new regulations or anything\nIsn't this really for new regulations and they're also fighting a ballot measure that would effectively bad and most new drilling at least according to the industry and so they've raised the staggering thirty eight million dollars in their campaign group that's almost double the next closest I could find in state history going back to two thousand fourteen there was a measure\nTo expand casino games that Aurora horse tracks that raise twenty million that was the previous record or it should be noted too that the group that is supporting the setbacks are against the industry they've raise less than a million dollars so you've got thirty eight million to less than one million\nNow the Colorado governor's races also breaking spending records with Jared polish the Democratic candidates are spending a good portion of his own fortune on his campaign\nTwenty two million dollars so far I'm nobody's ever spend money like that on their own campaign in Colorado history you've spent eleven million dollars of his own money just since the primary um he's attack millionaire he's never been afraid of spending money on politics\nAnd his Republican opponent Walker Stapleton uh he's cobbled together about Thirteen million dollars both in his own campaign and superPACs would support him\nPull it also has a constellation of pac superPAC to support him as well who are contributing almost eight million dollars so huge money advantage to Jared polish but Walker Stapleton also has a significant amount of cash to get his message out\nIt's also going to be a crowded ballot with a lot of ballot measures and a lot of spending on those campaigns to\nWrites everybody's ballot will be a little bit different depending on where you live Denver voters will see twenty some odd questions on their ballot but quickly the transportation sales tax will be on there that's gone about ten million dollars in campaign spending\nA increased income taxes for schools are a couple of million bucks on both sides of that issue restrictions on payday lenders there's millions of dollars flowing into about issue as well\nAnd there's also money than flowing into especially state Senate races where Republicans have a narrow majority and they want to keep it\nFor the state Senate is very much in play at one seat majority for Republicans are and so we're seeing money poured into these racism ounce I've never seen before a Democrats have a huge advantage and direct contributions to candidates\nThree to one two to one advantage and they also have an advantage and superPACs I'm so there's millions of dollars flowing into super PACs that will\nDecide the fate of this election but Democrats definitely have the advantage in both superPAC indirect a fundraising and they say that that show there's momentum behind the Democrats whereas Republicans are saying\nIt doesn't really matter like you can there's diminishing returns after so many millions of dollars you can't buy anymore TV space it's all taken a\nA N Republicans also feel like some of the ballot measures will get conservative voters out to vote because their tax increases I'm so Republicans feel pretty good about their chances that they'd been able to get their message out even though they have a big money disadvantage\nShe said I'd love to help you and they drafted to build and went to law August Eighth and that means that a tasting room can open correct but you could make sucking

out what did he learn or not learn in these meetings in Riyadh and in Turkey\nWell if you learn anything new from the Saudis there's been no public discussion of that so far as he did say Riyadh is committed to a full transparent investigation of the Saudis as you note deny any involvement in cars Yogi disappearance a there are stated position is still that he left the consulate freely within an hour of arriving and they don't know where he is\nA there are however these multiple media counts reporting the Saudis were preparing to acknowledge ... died in the consulate during questioning\nNow turkey ... certainly got a very different story\nA Turkish investigators have said they have audio video evidence of the show just killing and dismembered ... add some more gruesome details are coming out today um after the meeting today Turkey's foreign minister uh wouldn't comment on those media reports uh but he said a full investigation will be conducted\nWell we know that Turkish authorities are looking hard I mean they've searched the consulate where 'cause she'll disappear two weeks ago and now we're hearing that those same authorities are waiting for approval to search the Saudi

show up at Turkey's foreign minister said today ah they were waiting for final mission they're expecting to search to happen today or this or to the cause of the building Monday did he all the evidence that to show that he was killed inside the building at least that's what an official tells the Associated Press\nAt president ... says the investigators are looking for traces of toxic materials he also said some surface was at the consulate had been painted over suggesting a possible effort to conceal evidence\nWhile Peter do the sense of whether this incident is being perceived differently in Turkey than it is in Saudi Arabia\nI think that's pretty clear a very different versions of the story playing out a year in Turkey or getting more and more details coming out based on this audio video evidence Turkish investigators claim to have\nOf the killing a reportedly know including the voice of the Saudi consul general Mohammed al ... or he left turkey yesterday which the

the crown prince either as a bodyguard part of his entourage or or in some other capacity and also a government forensics expert\nOr as also problematic for this exclamation explanation for that this
