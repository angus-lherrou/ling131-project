A. B. E. Johnny thanks a lot You're welcome\nChicago police officer who shot and killed a Fifteen year old boys six years ago will be returned to duty that is even after his own boss tried to keep them off to force\nThe Chicago police board made that decision it is a group of civilians appointed by the mayor and city council they get final say on police discipline it's one of many civilian police sports in this country\nPolice do not always like civilians peering over their shoulders this way but this civilian board routinely blocks the department from firing officers W ... Miles Bryan reports\nIntel recently pan the Edwards was feeling hopeful that the officer who killed her son would face serious consequences\nIn twenty twelve Chicago police officer brand Internet fatally shot Dakota bright on the city's south side turn and says he saw the teen carrying a gun but no gun was found on his body last year an official investigation finally found the shooting to be not justified and the police superintendent move to fire tournament\nBut earlier this month Chicago's police board voted to reject that conclusion\nEdwards says she had no idea it was coming\nHard because his life\nOf a light\nBaby my baby is going to get some justice\nIn a written opinion the police Port Said it found officer turn out to be credible when he said decoded bright made him fear for his life\nAnd where it says the decision was particularly painful to take because in a closely watched trial just a week earlier a jury voted to convict Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke for the murder of another black teenager Guam McDonald\nStanding on the residential block where her son was killed and we're ... voice her son's age just don't have the luxury of trusting the police\nThey have no chance in this city with the folks who have no right you are nothing when it comes to the holy\nThe bright case is not unusual from two thousand five to twenty Fifteen the Chicago police board voted almost sixty percent of the time to allow officers to police superintendent wanted to fire to keep their job instead\nBrian core heads the national association for civilian oversight of law enforcement he says well lots of cities have civilian oversight groups the Chicago Board the ability to overrule the police departments wishes\nMakes it stand out for a civilian oversight aged ... to have that power of the many oversight agencies around the country it's relatively unusual\nIt's it's due process run amok ... teaches at Northwestern law school and is an attorney with the MacArthur Justice Center she says the police sport which was created in response to a police scandal in the fifties has a reputation for protecting officers from discipline\nAccording to a department of justice investigation released last year the information that board members get to see about a case is unfairly skewed in the officers favor in the board members are political appointees who investigators say generally have had no background in policing or accountability it's not set up to try to root out police officer\nWho are engaging in an excessive force who are racist and you use these tactics indiscriminately that's not what system set up to\nChicago officials are considering a number of reforms to police oversight one proposal would scrap the police force entirely replacing it with an elected body but that's little comfort for pansy Edwards who still angry as she grieve the loss of her son muscle [noise]\nPeople was Chicago White nobody means muggy like\nBasically may ... kilos and may stand by hand\nThe Chicago police sport wouldn't make any of its voting members available for an interview but the board's executive director says it weighs its own evidence and\nMake decisions case by case for NPR News I'm Miles Bryan in Chicago [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nThis is CPR news my claim six forty two and forty four degrees in Denver this morning\nForty one in Colorado Springs forty five in Grand junction all across the state another uh mostly sunny day but things turning a cloud of your and crude her over the next couple of days in Denver at times today near Seventy and then dropping into the sixties tomorrow and Wednesday\nWith the possibility of some rain over the next couple of days and it's the same for western Colorado\nWas right around Grand Junction and rain and snow coming to veil over the next day or so\nOur team of Colorado matters is putting together what has become kind of a CPR tradition and that's what they call the Colorado matters holiday extravaganza them used to live on stage and this year they're looking for a local musician or local bands who joined the line up you can audition for that spot\nAnd CPR dot org just search the word extravaganza and you can join us for a holiday or Colorado matters special tissue CPR new\nSo bad for a small increase six cents on ten dollars we can raise about seven hundred and Ninety seven million dollars a year\nWe can bond out of that money six billion dollars in projects remember see that has a nine billion dollar project lists and we can address local needs and when you consider that eighty eight percent of the road you drive on are maintained by your cities and counties you have to address both the state and the local needs if you're going to improve our system\nOf course the Colorado Department of transportation I Will note there's another big difference between these planes so prop one oh nine fix our damn roads provides money for state roads and interstates prop one to end the tax increase would fund state and local roads and other\nTransportation projects maybe like a regional bus system or a bike way that the community you might want\nYou both painted a picture of this state's starving transportation but in recent years they have directed some additional funds to roads\nBut Kelly addressed this fundamental idea of a tax increase Colorado's economy certainly growing but so is the cost of living housing prices for instance are among the highest in the country why not take a more limited approach like John's to avoid a tax increase [noise]\nYeah so the coalition we worked with actually did take a limited approach a there'd be a lot in the state who would argue we should be asking for more money there is a couple of reasons we focused on both a tax increase and a sales tax\nSo first while the state has increased revenue\nIt's projected to hit it's taxpayer bill of rights that Taber limits in two thousand nineteenth which means the state can't retain that revenue it will refunded to taxpayers so you can't use it for transportation or anything else that reality caused our coalition to say you really need to raise revenue dedicated to transportation you're saying\nThat Taber mitigate the bounty that we've described here so far exactly\nWell first of all the sales tax increase springs a terrible burden on on working families I think about folks in Congress city will be paying close to ten percent with all the other sales tax increases in Denver could be up to nine percent sales tax that hurts working folks are right where they live\nThere are so much money coming in to the state underneath the taxpayer bill of rights cap thanks to pulling out things called fees we now have room to bring in so much more money\nSo by borrowing and focusing on jump starting these most critical projects this is something that's been done before we called it the trans initiative which he wrecks project or was\nThis was a widening of I twenty five through Denver for instance\nAnd twenty five other projects around the state you know the difference back then when Bill Owens pushed it and voters approved was the money was actually coming out of the budget with fixture damn Roach prop one oh nine that money is coming from the surplus money that's coming in people might not realize and they will at the end of year when they do their taxes\nThat the Trump tax code actually means of tax increase for most people's state income tax\nAnd you think that should be tapped for roads and some of it should ... what do you say John Caldera to those who complained that one oh nine is just a drop in the bucket\nIt's not a drop in the bucket it is a serious amount of money to jumpstart the most critical projects we'd be really clear in concede this is not a silver bullet\nIt is a doable amount my sense is that people are not ready for a state wide tax increase they're usually not they usually go down very strongly so what is it that we can get done immediately and that's where one oh nine is\nAnd on one ten Kelly rough to this idea of the sales tax increase you are hearing from mayor is like the mayor in Colorado Springs he says listen we've already passed some local taxes to address our own local transportation needs\nAlong comes to the states and the burden is just going up too high in our specific community would you address that concern for us\nRural Colorado local communities there are not going to be able to on their own solve their transportation needs\nDo you have any concerns that the tax rate is getting too high and some color on the computer so our tax rate when you combine both state and local is still very competitive in the country and so we don't have concerns about at our greater concern is our failure to invest is impacting us greatly\nJunk how they're all note that one oh nine fix or down roads really does not make any funds available for alternative transportation that's a key difference here why\nWell when you take a look at how much the state has been putting into transit it's not as though a transit systems are starving for money in other words we're spending a lot of money on transit as it is our roads are in trouble and we need to start investing in these problems\nThanks for being with us both of you thank you thanks for having fun Kelly ... is president of the Denver metro chamber of commerce and heads a coalition in favor of prop one ten to raise the state's sales tax for transportation\nJohn ... heads the libertarian independence Institute he supports problem one oh nine otherwise known as fix our damn roads you would raise three and a half billion dollars in\nBonds and repay them with existing state funds I'm Ryan ...
