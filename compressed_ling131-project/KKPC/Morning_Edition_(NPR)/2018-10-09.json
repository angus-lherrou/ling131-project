of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defined the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill weeds it told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and caught and they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that ... could create such a nice you bring so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged it drifted across the landscape been injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\nTrish best known your neighbor and your friend that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board passed the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die campus spraying during the growing season the summer I called Terry fuller back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year scripts politically correct is just been sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant boards investigators try to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation I talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive\nA couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way and by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules\nLike Ted now personally I don't believe in spraying dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new die campus tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop of dot camera show everybody says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up I can but had blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people inside and I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to keep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's sprayed\nThat legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't get injured [noise] and then he'd\nBe tempted to spray dot camera to\nDan Charles NPR News [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThis is Colorado Public radio news each day

DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauces and sort of Facebook this comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers\nAccording to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company decided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hike morning so can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affect the number is abuser is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed or didn't\nDo right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent they found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nForward with this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data breach this happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nFacebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation at a bigger way ... what\nHave they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took a pretty drastic step which they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in a some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like ... there are there are a lot of\nDifferent apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationships with developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent a situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google's they care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined colleagues and writing a

overdue change\nScale is friendship too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back\nTowards the center Alaska as some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large new mines in oil developments in the works\nIf it passes Alaska would enact a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat\nAmong other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon streams that they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties would acknowledge is that in a state like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this it's really kind of some in your nose at the big guys you know\nFor decades Alaska's economy has depended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of that like this wire\nIt claims to protect their habitat but it actually improved as burdensome new regulations the flu or stop Alaska projects\nCompanies have poured millions into the campaign against the ballot measure\nWith help from donors like BP and Exxon Mobil they've raised more money than all free of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined turn Matthias is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far ... existed with minds that oil developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems\nCrazy the funniest things the initiative prioritizes standing at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers\nWe couldn't have the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans salmon are more than just a living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their vital food source and a traditional way of life in one of the last

especially in these divided days\nWe work with Alison green who writes the popular ask a manager blog where you can write to her or to us with your store in the workplace or management issues things for weighing in here Alison\nHi David thanks for having me we talked to some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because\nPolitics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we have a very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable to talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders he might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful of that that\nIt also at some levels of diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree with the boss politically that's going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from those people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drawing them into conversations sort of making them feel complicit envy points that they find pretty harmful or offensive\nLard these days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court nomination hearings I've been going on and even if someone is resolved I'm not going to talk about this at work regardless of what side of that particular issue one is you can imagine someone looking at the TV and saying\nOh you know one way or another and it's a little hard to suppress all of one's reactions\nI think it can be useful to to think that it from the other side if your coworker we're talking about a candidate at all the time who you found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office ... and then it may impact the way that you thought of that person may impact the relationship in subtle ways\nAnd there's no reason that

it's the Bible being fulfilled ... you know you look at scripture Jerusalem as the capital this ... being there to guide being fulfilled the one can look at it with your own ice yep yep\nDeborah home and Diane Weber from Minnesota say they're with their worship group visiting Israel to reach out to the Jewish people they support Trump's decision to move the embassy here\nWell because it says in scripture that does that blast Israel well themselves bless those that curse Israel will be her\nLook at what happened since the U.S moved its embassy she says the U.S economy has improved\nWere blessing is wrong or being lost\nSeveral people I met at the embassy mentioned the Israeli Palestinian peace plan Trump says he'll present and a few months recently Trump said he thinks the two state solution would work best a Palestinian state alongside Israel Holleman Webber and other visitors I met had this message for Trump\nDon't give up any inland\nDo not negotiate to give up any of them is that where\nThey think Palestinians won't stop at a Palestinian state and will want Israel for themselves to Melissa Bruno was visiting from Georgia\nDoesn't mean that you discriminate against that that Palestinians you know you love them and they should be taking care of and things like that that Israel is solving and they should have their own sovereignty that land\nAs one of the church group saying a Palestinian watched on he was Palestinian Americans that Korea has year at the embassy for relatives visa interview I asked him what he thought the idea these visitors have that moving the U.S embassy to Jerusalem reflects God's Plan\nEverybody can seem like got told me this is my land God's Plan for me is this is by these thing\nThe other Palestinians I met here we're not interested in talking politics they were trying to get visas to go live in the U.S\nAnd he wanted to send them a lot there's more freedom and us in the west bank we can't take our kids out for fun you need Israeli permits for everything and I want to keep my children protected\nThat's jak lean Rafiq who came to the embassy from her home in the Israeli occupied West Bank she's with her husband in six children they happen to be Christian for them this embassy represents\nA possible escape from the reality is that the life they live here\nDaniel Estrin NPR News Jerusalem\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News
