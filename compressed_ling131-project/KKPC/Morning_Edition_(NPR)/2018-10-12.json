this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek\nCourier I was actually a Trump voter I was on my vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can argue maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote ... this is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included\nAudrey Long did those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would have oh heck\nYeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University Good morning guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought to use this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder for them I mean there's almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just one for the most\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here well\nAmy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nAge ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy\nBarr also had any bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely do in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads in bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to a majority of black cool [noise] um [noise] I mean I I have dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not\nRacist by any means and I never thought anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college it's one of the only white girl on the team and we all got along\nEverybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason we support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that kind of yeah [laughter]\nI just I feel like [noise] I don't I feel like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really nice you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nWell I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of\nDivides in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south or the east and fell to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African American and Latino communities because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky with the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants this is becoming a more diverse state has to\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a particle which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did\nAre multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by it\nIt's to me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump's emphasis train that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often that's been racialized right quite often it\nAddressed um toward immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants but there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um ah the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls ... we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was\nEight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote and yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black populations\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen does your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in his congressional election\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does for so many people who are who are the working poor right people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\nWhat you each of you think about as you hear that voice\nI think about um the feelings we've heard across a number of these interviews of marginalization of different flavors the economic be at racial ... ideological\nMeaning that that isolation that feeling of isolation Israel for a lot of people out cross you get the last word here\nI'd like voter ... voters they do remember that the choices by Mary and binary choice is gradually move the U.S through a continuum of history but each election there's a binary choice and uh I Hope people don't stay home on either side\nOK el ... and Emily ... thanks very much to both of you we're live at broom wagon bikes in Lexington, Kentucky and guitarist Bruce Lewis has got to take us

suggesting\nWell since the bear market ended in March two thousand and nine we've seen twenty days where the S. and P. five hundred was down three percent and during every one of those days it feels like this is it this is the end\nHave you taken money off the table on any of those prior uh events you would have left a ton of upside there\nAnd then you run into the real significant problem which

presidents sees it dropped precipitously in the past\nTwo months the briefings have also gotten shorter about twenty five percent shorter on average from the first year of the Trump Administration meanwhile in recent days President Trump has been speaking for himself a lot\nFor any more she's watched this could lead to others question just their question and the other questions I don't know anything\nOn air force one on the tarmac on the south lawn of the White House in the oval office and calling into Fox News' Mike McCurry was press secretary for President Bill Clinton\nPresident Trump is writes users pressured is the one that ought to be the first one and I I'm not even sure he likes it or you just got some older folks were pressured\nMcCrary was Clinton spokesman during the star investigation and other challenging news cycles\nThere were many times for I Would have been happy they just run my briefing against let's just go party\nBut he didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and fielded the incoming\nIt just felt like it was a\nAnd you know sort of a democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for this story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly in this age\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation in the Trump Administration its utility decreased\nDynamic and the purpose of the briefing shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and name right\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretary McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature the briefings shouldn't be live televised event\nThat met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen Fleischer who was press secretary for George W. Bush now bemoan the state of the briefing\nThe good government on paper side of me says of course there should be a regular briefings the realist watching the hostility between the Trump White house press corps in both directions says what's the point to the ... there's no news is just hostility\nHe points to exchanges like this one plus I don't have any of them don't have any problems stating facts know John\n... but I Know that then you probably do have a problem with\nStill\nDana Perino who also served as press secretary for George W. Bush says regular briefings have value the press secretary isn't just speaking to the press Xi speaking to the whole world\nIt is a mutually beneficial thing for a daily briefing to take place\nMutually beneficial she says because taking questions forces the administration to hone its policy and message it's a kind of accountability Purina says she welcomed internally\nWhen the cabinet or the staff knows that the press secretary has to got an answer questions from the press it can force decision making or consensus\nThat question how am I going to explain this to the press can be a powerful motivator parakeet NPR News [noise]\n[noise] and\nLater this afternoon on all things considered a month ago there was a series of gas explosions in Massachusetts thousands of residents are still without gas service and their crews are working to replace pipelines but with temperatures expected to drop officials are also arranging alternative housing you can listen by asking your smart speaker to\nPlay NPR or your local member station by name\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News\nI'm barber sector I live in Denver and I'm a network partner when I think about giving a hundred dollars a month or more I realize how little that is every day and I think giving that to CPR and making that\nAvailable to both myself and the community seems like a worthwhile investment for me becoming ... because it feels so good and it's the right thing to do and it makes you smile\nLearn how you can become a network partner at CPR dot org\n[noise]\n\n\nMy name is George ... and I support Colorado Public radio [noise]\n\nI live in green valley ranch and I work in Boulder so I have a good forty five minutes to some times an hour and Fifteen minute depending on the traffic Dr CPR there with me every day both to and from work\nIs really the only place that I can find where I feel like the news and information that I'm getting is coming from place that I could try [noise]\n\nI\nGot rid of cable several months ago I don't miss it but I still feel the need to get my news and my information I'm wearing CPR do bad boys for me [noise]\n\nBecome a member today it's easy to pledge on line of CPR dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from visit St Petersburg Clearwater along Florida's Gulf Coast offering artistic draws including St Pete's Dali museum the truly collection and the museum of fine arts more at visit saint Pete Clearwater dot com\nFrom Amazon Prime video presenting the return of the man and the hike hassle where America's history is under siege but the resistance rises to fight for the world they want the new season is now streaming on prime video\nAnd from battle a European made language learning program babble teaches practical conversation and Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available in the app store or online at B.

idea for America\nWhat do you think your friendship is someone your age would be against Trump\nBecause most people my age are I'm I'm usually don't have political conversations with people my age just because they're so ready to pounce on anybody that doesn't think the same way as them I think that a lot of people my age they just the bike and why they don't see ...\nOkay why would halls we favor Trump not because she's poor many poor people we interviewed don't vote that's twenty three year old unemployed mom we met she's never voted palsy\nPapers Trump's attitudes because she is doing

assault but\nI've worked in the prison system I you know I I suffered sexual assault my mother did and it was an substantiated um even though I had I witnesses\nWhat you were assaulted in the
