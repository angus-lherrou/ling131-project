near our lawn freedom of information explicitly states that such information so the um public budget to exercise a public duties are all public information basically when we started this project three years ago um that was sort of the focus of\nThe initiative and we're talking about considerable amounts of money here members of the European parliament's get more than four thousand euros every month for what's called general expenditure allowance which is to get offices and so on\nBut that's about the same and they'll just four thousand US dollars and they don't have to account for\nNo they don't actually the European Parliament admitted to us during the process of trying to access information of public importance that they do not cold any documents on this allowance therefore we ran out of their own investigation\nInto these national offices that are supposed to be funded from these four thousand and some heroes\nAnd we found that around a third of the any peace as offices and the national states where non existent or they could not locate them so that means at least a third of the any peace is was abusing the rules of spending for this general expenditure allowed\nRight so there's these four thousand dollars just going somewhere nobody knows where what do you think they are doing with it\nWell it depends it depends on who you ask some any peace publish these expenses even for general expenditure alone in some shape or form under websites\nSome have any peas refuse to disclose what they're doing with this money we\nHad instances where any peace said that um he was saving money for old age an ... said that he donated this money to his national party\nTo stop you there and it's because I'm not legal is it does not know\nThat is all against the rules the documents on expenses that we are asking are trying to access all pertain exclusively to the exercise of public mandates of the any peace but they're all meant to be spent exclusively on such cost not on

they did it wasn't the week returned to be honest I'm I've been back to sort of sense and talk to the Hutu leadership they'll throw leadership about what needs to be done to get them to talks next time and I think we're working with logistical issues that need to be resolved\nBut you have the classic dilemma everyone talks about a political solution and wanting it but every one is fighting and that includes the Saudi led coalition which is using the arms and sophisticated weaponry provided to arms sales from Britain the United states in France\nYes that's what we're trying to stop a and

growing too fast\nNo I think that one of the great things about about Colorado that has been the case\nHas been people love moving here and a lot of people have moved here from the coast because we have a bundle natural resources and incredible quality of life\nAnd I want people to continue to feel like they want to move and be site to live in the state of Colorado you'd like to do those here yet the only way we do that the ... and it is that we need to manage our growth better and the only way we manage our growth better is by finding a long term solution to our crumbling infrastructure\nAnd finding attainable housing and I use the term attainable versus affordable\nBecause what may be affordable for somebody in the metro area on a certain salary may not be attainable for somebody in western Colorado wore down in Pueblo and those are the two priorities that I Will first addresses governor\nFixing our crumbling infrastructure over the long term and making housing more attainable for young people that are moving here\nLet's unpack that to roads or you oppose the sales tax measure on the ballot this year backed by the Denver metro chamber of commerce you supportive bonding proposal called fix our damn roads is there something above and beyond that ballot measure you think is the right way to address what you call crumbling infrastructure\nYes absolutely and the reason I don't support the ah the sales tax measure um that the chamber of commerce is pushing is it only forty cents on the dollar will actually be spent on roads and bridges and this is\nYou touched on something that is a difference between myself and congressman polish\nCongressman polish talks a lot about multi mode of transportation public transit and mountain a mountain biking and and road biking lanes and I think that our infrastructure ... or ... or so acute that the precious money that we have to dedicate to this should be dedicated entirely to roads and bridges until we solve our problems\nLet's pause here it's true that Stapleton democratic opponent supports alternative forms of transportation but Jared policy is not a fan of the sales tax we just talked about\nHe told us he doesn't personally support it but would implemented if it passes bullet says he doesn't think it's the right way to raise money for infrastructure [noise] okay back to walk Stapleton\nBut yes absolutely we need to do more than fix our our our dang roads I think we need to dedicated sources of revenue in the general fund that can and should go to infrastructure improvements over the long term what it gets cut what suffers as a result of that nothing new new sources of revenue one of the things that I've talked about\nThat he's going to happen and it's going to happen the next legislative session is that ah whether Ryan Warner walkers Stapleton wanted a sports gambling is coming to Colorado the Supreme Court has said that this is okay across the country there are big companies like buffalo wild wings and Hooters that want to have\nSports gambling and I think we can effectively the way it's worked in other states as a tack on at ten percent or Fifteen Percent tax on the revenues of sports gambling 'em and dedicated to infrastructure improvements in I'm advocating for that okay and to the idea of attainable housing\nWhat role can a governor play into that a couple of different roles um I think state government can be a valuable catalyst\nFor creating more housing give us a supply and demand problem is somebody who has a background in economics it's a simple supply and demand problem on but we haven't done a good job of fixing it first of all I think we need a meaningful construction defects reform that we have not had and that includes a right to cure\nFor a builder over Ninety or a hundred and twenty day period if what they say they don't have that if you had your dogs writer because living in well and and if you're building Ryan at three hundred unit condo development chances are you're going to find a wire that's misplaced in the bathroom\nThe developers should be able to cure that over and now you're a hundred and twenty day period without the threat of litigation and that has stifled or the development if you look at what's happening in Denver for instance\nUh last year we had about half the residential condo permits pulled and we had ten years ago even though the population has gone up by more than a million people that's number one number two is I think the governor can work with ... on the tax credit process to Colorado has a ... yeah this is very\nColorado housing and finance on the tax credit program which is somewhat antiquated which is very very badly backlogs so that if developers willing to put a portion of\nHis or her development towards affordable housing they can have as fast\nIneffective and approval process as possible very briefly what evidence do you have the construction defects reform will actually unleash the condo market the evidence that I have is it if we meaningfully fixed it I think that we would have ... we would have more supply on market because that's not all of it\nAnd that's what you think that that's I think that that's that is anecdotal evidence of a problem not being fixed I think that a lot of condo developers are not developing because of the threat in fear of lawsuits\nAnd a lot of the legislation has unfortunately been watered down by different interests it's absolutely the case that we would have more condos being built
