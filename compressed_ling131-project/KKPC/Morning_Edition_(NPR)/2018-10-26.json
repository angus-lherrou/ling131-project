congressional district district which is actually a rare swing district in his very red state it covers a long stretch of\nLand that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio\nAnd we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections immigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river ... means friendships in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll realize case it's the city of junior Mexico\nWe're a family and this border\nThis is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them I Am they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAmanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph\nWaldo grow up there like if you're going to be like some tea okay everybody would be in a hot too humid or Haile Selassie route than manned across into a ... a couple of times a week\nWhat takes it as I have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over their Amanda has\nSympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight you can get it because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... ... ... when they separate ... there is a while I'm thinking of anybody backing you what you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not a wall there's a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nOf this rooms rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months I think we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's\nDoing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico that's linked up\nBefore anybody starts talking about the border wall\nThe new to see it in its natural state\nPeople up north like who is a war zone at her\nAnd it's actually not\nTo me before you start throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem\nThere perks sheriff\nThat'll do further as much as\nJust across this little yes safe even reverse this looks like a lake of encourage the river and remember how many feet are we talking about\n... what three hundred feet foreigner feet\nI mean that's a hard to some across so a night someone can just swim across\nJust walk up here just like we did and walk to that road mhm I asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities and even the republic\nCongressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump but this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's one of the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill ever come to an air of giving them the same tour I like well he's he felt that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because you're Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe worked or if we were both everybody else was even the bones were eating bologna\nAnd I'll take that to solve the immigration issue the sheriff has to be at the table you can't you can't just go to jail\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras instead of putting their physical structure because you're going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people in Mexico are you going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nMeanwhile people like Amanda year a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her\nBackyard as she did with that when I saw my dad and just like that were in Mexico [noise]\nThe the exchange faces right here where

bright ideas boost the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things such as widgets coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas\nDr Paul Romer chews on all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism ice things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plan\nRobbers an economist in New York University's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of\nTwo winners of the Nobel Prize in economics ... welcome to the program glad to be here I mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses\nBe patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization and the way this was gonna destroy jobs the complacent attitude would have been to say it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century\nThere was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything can turn out better for everybody but if you just are complacent say out it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to the labor force\nAnd with artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says a highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely ... and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know the ... century turned out fine so there's no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back\nThere are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and in thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of it pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights an economics is this idea of a division of labor and do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they tried to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally uh say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but ... are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go to a doctor rumor

really is aspirational she she totally feels the divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it\nAnd these voters are going to be making decisions into really big races how are they talking about the Senate contest between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz and about the congressional race\nRight so we should say the congressional race a pitch the incumbent Republican we'll heard against the Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones and according to a recent poll by the New York times will heard is up in that race by Fifteen points so that's a really big spread you know he's got an advantage not only is he the incumbent but she's\nReally positioned himself as as a moderate in in a swing district which he has to do a and and that is working to his advantage over ark and cruise much closer a cruise is up by seven points Beto O'Rourke is making a play uh we'll see

Rachel Martin and this morning we are broadcasting from Del Rio Texas which is just a few miles from the U.S border with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake on his side on the Rio Grande river this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really why the only swing districts in this red state and we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty Eighteen but terms and how they measured the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere's a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and merits that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings governing the medical Hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas sky and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in\nPolitics but something that's\nReally nice um but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters are Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there is a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as opposed to the he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our posters said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing uh she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election President Trump two thirds say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs in the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats it's health care and climate change I noticed I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rounds okay entitlements\nAnd fears of medical months in our across the Midwest\nScreen harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated\nBy a trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans\nAnd third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\n[noise] brand\nAnd harvest sleeping in ... Iowa the combine blades cut the standard pods are pulled apart and the hard yellow being filled the hopper Osmond since cousin pose a matching red tractor up alongside positioning be attached grain cart catch the beans as they're offered out of the combined\n[noise] the U.S from agriculture predicts a record sleeping harvest this year that China once a major market for ... impose that twenty\nFive percent terrorists slashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the price Osman send will get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolled in with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobs says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland collapse he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop most of us will be glad when this year just over the agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact\nBut ... says that's not a real effects but we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming out [noise]\nI think\nHe cough elevator enrolling to Iowa the Web cranks open the hopper on a semi Gillette soybeans cascade into our pets from there there'll be conveyed to a nearby storage\nThan I Am a stay at the economist Chad Hart says higher prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable prices out there but that means we're going to have to have this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina has stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina wouldn't bought a lot of fighting from Argentina left them with it too short they had to kill them into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking season isn't going to end when the last beans hit the band

this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really why the only swing districts in this red state and we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty eighth team terms and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere is a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and merits that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings governing domestic Oh hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in politics\nBut something that's\nReally nice but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last [noise]\nNot really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's\nMore likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise a and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he'd motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the polls show that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or they said twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet Ogle ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWill you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election President Trump two thirds say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs in the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats health care and climate change a notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than okay entitlements and fears of medical mountain are\nAcross the Midwest it's grain harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by a trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans and third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\nAnd ran and harvest leaving inland on Iowa the combine blade cuts them paws are pulled apart and the hard yellow being filled the hopper\nHusbands cousin pose a matching red tractor up alongside positioning the attached rains hiring catch the beans as they're offered out of the combined\n[noise] the U.S from agriculture predicts a record sleeping harvest this year that China once a major market for soybeans impose a twenty\nFive percent tariff slashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the price awesome and then we'll get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the Harris persistent rain pushed harvest back my weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he\nSays even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still\nGoing to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable\nAt this point advising for now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop most of us will be glad when this year is just over the agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact\nBut ... says that's not a real sex but we are in an election year so I figured there'd probably be something like that coming out [noise]\nI think\nHe cough elevator enrolling to Iowa ... open the hopper on a semi Gillette soybeans cascade into effect from there there'll be conveyed by storage\nThan Iowa State at the communist Chad Hart says higher prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable prices out there but that means we're going to have to have this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of planes from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to kill them into the world market they bought them from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days of farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking season isn't going to end when the last beans hit the band for NPR News I'm Amy Mayer
