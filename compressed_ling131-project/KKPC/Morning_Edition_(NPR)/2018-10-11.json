to the missing Saudi journalist democracy Yogi\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Danville is Campbell turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country Saudi officials continue to deny any involvement in ... disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with ice cream thanks for having me\nYou're reporting that of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back\nUh yeah so as you say the the us is gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears to confirm\nThat the Saudi leadership at the highest levels were seeking asylum ... ah he had written columns in the last year and the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there and the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance them you know even that they were friendly with him and put their now worried about the safety of the\nIntelligence intercepts obviously under cut those assertions and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened right\nSo let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in its Campbell his disappearance at that ... could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts have raised that possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what\nInside that conflict right there is\nThat there is this theory that that what happened inside may have been part of\nA a backup plan to capture him that somehow withdraw so US Senators have that triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for it to its appearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading\nThe investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks are that the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they said that they will\nPresent their findings um when the time is right um but you know all of this has raised questions\nAbout whether the U.S had a duty to warn about how about the details of the ... ah that they've discovered and\nIt's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up this is potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nOkay three mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president's speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can have let this happen\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program ... so\nThe president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico or traditionally what us put onto but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel a disclosure of both\nTo Trump a and a bunch of Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia a show it ... it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship with just one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country um to stop him from\nI'm going to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies cause what brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability\nOf the Senate and others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant it on the same way that we've seen\nI'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russian that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or ... after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together is\nThe government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way [noise]\nUm it it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who were opponents of the Saudi regime a he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be\nA a real problem\nFor the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians\nI Won the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained in the rich Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong\nAnd again I just want you to North Korea I mean Trump expressing his love for Kim Jong loon who is by far the most criminal behavior we've seen\nIn the hour
