maybe turning to snow\nThere's mountains snow already and the temperatures in the thirties this morning a ... veil and they won't get much warmer than that through the day western Colorado the rain continues for much of the week around Denver things might get a bit warmer sea by Wednesday and Thursday\n[noise] six forty three and this is MORNING EDITION and CPR news\nWe used the term secret earlier and\nSo there's some dispute over whether this committee was actually being kept secret the White House is saying no it's not secret it just was never publicly announced is that unusual for committees to go on announced\nIt is common enough for the federal government and the White House to consider a wide range of policy issues\nWhat's different here in addition to the fact that it is not announced an obviously a matter of public interest\nIs that the stance of the federal government is so opposed to Americans at large who are increasingly supportive of legalizing marijuana so if there is a committee that is doing work\nAt odds with the direction of the American people that is unusual and the fact that it's thought announced is remarkable and does make it feel quite secretive\nEspecially given that this covers so many federal agencies it's not necessarily a small enterprise okay back to this idea of where I'm the sort of directive\nAnd the view of marijuana is coming from is it the highest echelons I eat President Trump\nIs it's perhaps his attorney general who has compared marijuana to heroin or is it as you suggest lower level bureaucrats for lack of a better term you you just don't know at this point\nWe don't know and we've seen the executive branch sort of all across the map Trump has said that he supports the right of states like Colorado and others with legalization laws to continue with their plans he told senator Cory Gardner of Colorado that they had reached some sort of agreement to not interfere there\nAt the same time the White House has said that we should expect more marijuana enforcement us attorney Bob Troyer of Colorado has said that he would possibly bring charges against the business even though it is licensed by the state\nSo we're really seeing a number of mixed messages and it's hard to read what's going on one of the things to keep in mind though is that many people in these states\nBelieves that while there could be risks with marijuana legalization their benefits too and it's not clear that the federal government is taking into account that some of these marijuana uh businesses displace illegal crime rings are gangs they create tax revenue that goes to public health\nThey card people to make sure they're Twenty one before they buy marijuana so there are people across the country who see the benefits of legalization and it's not clear that the federal government is considering both sides of this issue the same way\nYou mentioned Colorado as us attorney Bob Troyer\nAnd he did indeed announced that he'll take a look at commercial growers and vendors who may be contributing to the marijuana black market or even though their license under state law he says there are too many loopholes in state law what what do you make of the timing\nI find it a little unusual honestly the premise of his argument if the issue is that too much marijuana is getting out of the legal system into the illegal one abolishing the regulatory legal schemes only seems to exacerbate the problem\nIt is possible that he could see the Colorado now with legalization in place for many years has problems with its regulatory scheme and he does want to crack down\nIt seems though that he might be able to achieve his ends if he is sincere about them by working with people in the state to make sure that those problems don't continue\nLet's step back here you've got the federal government's forming this committee to look at marijuana and what might their end goal be do you have any sense from the creation of this committee or any of its proceedings what they want to achieve\nGiven the fact that they've asked for data with negative trends and they said they wanted to possibly present this information to the White House or to the president himself\nIt could be that they are in the early stages of an effort to run essentially a campaign against legalization to make people concerned about the harms of marijuana they said that they want the agencies to portray it and show how it is a national threat a security threat a health threat\nAnd they could use that to try to ... efforts to legalize marijuana in other states when I followed up with the White House and asked if they were looking for any positive information about legalization\nWho had started at a this committee or what is being done now and what's coming up uh they didn't answer those questions so it's very hard to assess what their next steps going to be\nDominic thanks so much for sharing your reporting with us Ryan thank you for having me buzzfeed's Dominic Holden his report that the Trump Administration has a marijuana committee prompted Colorado senator Michael Bennet to raise concerns it's misleading people about the drug\nBennett has said in a statement that he intends to hold the committee to its commitment to present objective and scientific information about cannabis I'm Ryan Warner CPR
