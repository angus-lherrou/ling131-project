decades ago\nAnd in Rochester, Minnesota yesterday President Trump cast the Supreme Court voted purely partisan terms\nDemocrats\nBeen trying to destroy judge Brett Kavanaugh says [noise]\nThe very first second he was announced and it was announced for one simple reason he is an incredible intellect\nKevin himself said that he was the victim of a conspiracy of Democrats seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons yesterday the nominees vaguely backed off of that is or shouldn't saying that he said some things you shouldn't have and his public testimony although we did not specify what those things were\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nGood morning you thank you for having me so let's note that you ever had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what's missing\nThere are no interviews with some of the really key witnesses including Dr ... the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses\nThere is evidence that should have been pursued lead that should've been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance of a white water had\nLet let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride or who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally every interview conducted by the FBI\nLeads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR pursue leave after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly described as to who they could interview and how long they add and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate for\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hand of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful testimony in the interview although it's not in court it's in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eye witness than other leads that should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent who had information that\nJudge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just hundreds and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there is solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach by here too important points first of all this report should be made public so you and I\nCan't engage in a real conversation\nAnd so that the contention them making can eat the border by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was disqualifying the self dating arrogant\nAcrimonious

associates over the next five years and that's going to be through education and training and you know it's really an extension of something we started back in two thousand Fifteen\nIf you're working you have to find the time to retrain and it sounds like you've been doing some thinking about this because you may have family commitments you may in fact have a second job and you know where you find the time to get the retraining Dunn is a is a conundrum\nWe have a massive incumbent workforce that needs new skills to succeed in their current job let alone to move up let alone to to handle the challenges of the future of work\nWe funded a ... for example that found that two thirds of the fifty million people in service sector frontline jobs today have literacy gaps and three quarters of the people have numerous see gaps they're already in the workforce\nSo what we're trying to do is make it the norm not just at Walmart but across employers in general that people can learn on the job\nSo we've come at it a couple of different ways one is through our own training programs and then what we've also done is a program that allows people to get access to four year degrees a dollar a day on their own time\nMiserable often I have to ask you why is this Wal Mart's problem\nIt's an interest in any business to address the challenges and opportunities that that have to do with the systems they rely on in our case our people are critical that's how we serve the customer our associates are the front line to the customer\nAnd it really starts with us wanting to provide the best experience

what matters is not what the video shows but what Van Dyke was perceiving\nAbout a month when that ... stops in terms looks right at the victim Herbert pointed to evidence that Van Dyke did not know

DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California later today we're going to find out whether the Senate is moving ahead to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court now however that vote goes it is certainly not going to be the end of the story exactly a year ago today Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault in an investigation into New York times\nThe me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment that Kavanaugh's nomination\nHas led to another movement and hash tag the hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that Emily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with ... believe survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nGlad to be here so why did you decide to write this piece I\nAm a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silence women come forward and tell their stories\nI think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French in conversation and people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community\nMy concern is that this hash tag cannot\nApply when a specific man is accused and some kind of education investigation or life altering effects happen\nWe simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\nSo what what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell\nWomen and tells survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward but then also add but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like what how do you\nHow do you handle that well as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me and\nThey're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago\nI thought about it it's not going to do a any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of uh issues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen someone is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying are as ... yep what these women said is right I did it\nA oftentimes we don't ah and I think we can draw some concerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law\nThat ah governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been a a an effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy\nA lot of missed justices have\nAnd systems had been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nJustices you you're saying most justices I mean the the accused of have nothing\nFairly and I know this was something you have written a lot about ah when this happened on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses these days but I'm just\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that should belief you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe he accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh adjudication\nI'm young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems\nAre based on a a pre determined assumption I at the end of the\nDay I mean that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still\nEncouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter]\nI don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way\nMaybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford reluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having\nA public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process and there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact and I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI'm equally a lot of people were a distressed by the uh extreme anger and aggressiveness a and partisan attacks\nBrett Kavanaugh now he was entitled to be very angry I have spoken to many young men\nWho've been through this process on campus\nTheir lives have all been profoundly changed even people who were cleared\nA say they'll never be the same so it's one thing to express your anguish about what happened it's another to go on an absolute endless attack and lawyers I spoke and you said if their clients had acted like this on campus they would have been ... bought found responsible for what they were used up\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic thank you so much for taking the time for us this morning really appreciate it thank you David [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nThis is the CPR news on my lap and later this morning there is more

sustainability officer came into our New York bureau to talk about job training welcome\nMy pleasure to be with you here today David thank you remind us about the Sledge a bunch of companies but Walmart very much included have pledged to train millions of people for the jobs are the future tell me more about that and how it's going we\nDid we joined that effort and Republicans committed there to provide training and scale development to at least a million of our US associates over the next five years and that's going to be through education and training and you know it's really an extension of something we started back in two thousand Fifteen\nIf you're working you have to find the time to retrain and it sounds like you've been doing some thinking about this because you may have family commitments you may in fact have a second job and you know where you find the time\nTo get the retraining Dunn is a is a conundrum we have a massive incumbent workforce\nThat needs new skills to succeed in their current job let alone to move up let alone to to handle the challenges of the future of work\nWe funded a study for example that found that two thirds of the fifty million people in service sector frontline jobs today have literacy gaps and three quarters of the people have numerous see gaps they're already in the workforce\nSo what we're trying to do is make it the norm not just at Walmart but across employers in general that people can learn on the job\nSo we've come at it a couple of different ways one is through our own training programs and then what we've also done is a program that allows people to get access to four year degrees a dollar a day on their own time\nIs because when I have to ask you why is this Wal Mart's problem it's in the\nInterest in any business to address the challenges and opportunities that that have to do with the systems they rely on in our case our people are critical that's how we serve the customer our associates are the front line to the customer and it really starts with us wanting to provide the best experience for our customer has a retailer\nI always say that you're the largest private employer in America is that's the\nLargest private employer and and I think we're also the largest training program in America four hundred thousand people a year and pathways you know five hundred thousand people in the

is there a gold standard for judging judges\nThe NBA gave him their unanimous well qualified rating what left wing groups and their democratic allies have gone to judge Kavanaugh\nIsn't nothing short of monstrous I saw what they did to Robert Bork\nI saw what they did to Clarence Thomas that was nothing compared to what we witness here in the last three months\nThe conduct of left wing dark money groups and their allies in this body\nHave shamed us all the\nFix was in from the very beginning before they ain't was even dry on the nomination the minority leader announced that he would oppose judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything he's got even before he knew the president's nominee minority\nLeader said that he was opposed to all twenty five well qualified potential\nNominees listed by this president\nEven one member of my committee said that those who vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh would be quote unquote complicit in evil\nAnother member of the committee revealed the endgame when she suggested that Senate Democrats to hold the vacancy open\nFor two years if they defeated judge Kavanaugh and took control of the Senate in these midterm elections\nI saw the most transparent I oversaw the most transparent confirmation process in Senate history based on the fact that more than five hundred thousand pages of judicial writings publications\nDocuments from judge Kavanaugh's executive branch service\nThis is on top of the three hundred and seven judicial opinions that he offered despite Democrats efforts to bury the committee and even more pay for the Senate Judiciary committee held a timely for day hearing\nOn judge Kavanaugh's nomination last month\nJudge Kavanaugh testified for more than thirty two hours over the course of three days\nJudge Kavanaugh show the nation exactly why he deserved to be on the Supreme Court because somebody's qualifications judge Kavanaugh's antagonize there's cutting land to punch on him during knows history days of testimony\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa reviewing some of the recent history very painful and very well known to many Americans at this point\nAs we prepare for a vote on cloture ending debate\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and I want to go briefly to Kelsey Snell NPR's Kelsey Snell because she is at the United States Senate today and Kelsey I Want to back away from Chuck Grassley voice for a moment can you just paint a picture of us who's in there is there is there a big crowd of senators which is not always the case\nActually on the floor for these speeches\nNot yet we're not at that part of the day yet I'm this is kind of a quieter moment defending his chest open and honest and you really only have one or two senators and the and a bunch of staffing and ... and a little ... pages that the high school students who I spend about ... started here in the capital helping the senators out\nWe expect that people will start sheltering in and giving speeches and I will also seen many speeches that are part of this debate that comes after the country about this ... this necessary procedurals out because some senators are saying that they are going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final concert\nOkay this is important let's underline this this is a vote to end debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now once you've heard all is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done and but it isn't written in stone\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare and we are I think some people including and you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to knock this throughout the day I knew exactly what will happen on that final ... which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedure hold up today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of\nDream and put them these senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how the culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean does this day and then all of this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades ... not knowing that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I had seen president on from just about any notice any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flash points of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so it seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills\nThey passed an fame but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance but\nAs soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how violent the other side as well still getting to the basics the government can't question is if they can continue to do that or if they fight flowers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington hey there Scott David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think time Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more a before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from\nJudiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin boating\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that lasts the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "05"}
