I'm David Greene more details are emerging now about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist democracy Yogi in Turkey\nBecause so gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance that team of fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate\nThe post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this in Istanbul and Peter what is standing out to you at this\nPoint if you learn more facts here\nWell I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police they arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper or describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of the men some they say our military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nA Turkish TV meanwhile are airing footage\nOf ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later a heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this stumble that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed her to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy ... one of the two points and not both the planes well\nThat's a all we know based on the information we have so far uh this is going to need some further explanation it's it's not clear why that would be the case\nIt what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details a one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert and the bones so it was used on the body after the murder\n... a bone saw 'em talk them into session assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that that is indeed\nWas a a targeted murder yes\nIt certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that this Yogi was spirited out of the country\nOr I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course denied any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate uh they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nUh they've also been invited to search the constantly building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today a there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabian turkey weren't the best of friends right but what what could I mean if if indeed this journalist was killed on Turkish soil and the Saudi Government something to do with what could this through the relationship to be with your country\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is a beyond the pale of anything\nThat would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do deny it completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case\nSo far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh cause for us investigators to join the probe are happening uh we'll see if something like that occurs\nNPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company and the US's encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at ExxonMobil had announced that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this snake on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nMobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council\nIts aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere Exxon Mobil his voice support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIf it's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal since group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why doesn't oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nBrutal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what's the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory ping pong and which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon ... plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurgers and says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's been Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president in the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it for a public ... today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal send acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort\nNPR's John Ydstie on NPR News\n\nI'm Matt wiesner CPR classical [noise]\nThis is music by a

C. American farmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute\nBut last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nMinistry is throats acting ethanol alright that's like [noise] we are unleashing the power of the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa the morning play good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that though\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sale of the kinds of gasoline called E. Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes they haven't completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road or certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there were also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no release that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight and I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a I was governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president and she worked changing plenty of compliments with each other also the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he seemed to be walking the line\nYou know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us Smith though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil\nIn mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it yeah I think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help matching on election day here's West Virginia public radio they've missed itch\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n[noise]\nCircles has been shattered unit orange order and\nBy that evening a sign saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston in the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office\nMiller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says she was a tenant and listen to their concerns\nBut after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you do when election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but he adds that if\nI'm In the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do turn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognized that mentioned is no liberal but his defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen says she won't vote for mansion in November Emily comer came to a similar decision she's a public schoolteacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion conversation will leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator Manchin in November I won't be voting from Patrick Marcy either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that it's going to fight for us\nAll three woman so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate for my computer that voting record is a sign that mentioned is an independent thinker can put it was a democratic state lawmaker for mentions home in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted him to do and and and they did they acted accordingly\nOr some people just don't be happy about that and some slowing me mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree a hundred percent of the time with anybody\nThe computer says mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or non affiliated voters with his vote for cabinet and computer believes mansion as certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote for cabin all that they abandoned him or if they want to continue the state's tradition of sending moderate Democrats to Washington for NPR

set about again trying to investigate lucky Louisiana\nBut do we want it to investigate it for murder or some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman in only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a moral crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up\nTo the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began so\nAfter Eunice was hired a she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these major come in and they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation but she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attack she actually put together the first evidence anyone who's ever had\nThe mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded in improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once you begin to gather the evidence she persuaded do we to a range of police raids which Eunice was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women were accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out\nThan it was to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers than to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses would turn against their bosses have helped to only turn against um Louisiana enter everyone's surprise\nEunice his idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana\nWere prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with was a woman known as Cokie flow brown researchers noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit\nOr when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Louisiana several times discussing with the prostitution business with his aides [noise]\nShe was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times let me interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to ... on her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony\nSo Cokie flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team and Lucy on his team had no women so she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony to the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise]\nSo how does learning this story changed your understanding of New York city and then I teen thirties or America the Nineteen thirties\nWondering take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to America now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people as they go into stores it talks about employment discrimination all the sorts of things that people talk about today but it's\nSame time I think part of our forgotten history is that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even

NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California there are more details are emerging about the disappearance of Saudi journalist democracy Yogi in Turkey so gives the Washington Post contributor who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into this disappearance that team\nA Fifteen Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate\nThe post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this in a stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point of view learn more facts here\nAnd uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police they arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence service as identified several of the men some they say our military officers including a special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV meanwhile is airing footage\nOf ... entering that constantly on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later a heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this stumble that same night\nX. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two planes and that both the planes well\nThat's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bone so it was used on the body after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this indeed was targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country\nI don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show the disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today and there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where that black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could this due to the relationship with your country\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is a beyond the pale of anything\nThat would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more put to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration a big one says quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case\nSo far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure in Riyadh Cosby us investigators to joined the pro are happening uh we'll see how something like that occurs\nNPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change channels the\nExxon Mobil contribution was supporter group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what's the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon tax his group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nRepublicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue of\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't

C. American farmers have had a\nTough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute but last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nAdministrator should throw texting apps and all All right that's right [noise] [noise] way our unleashing the power of the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa to morning play good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that though\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sale of a kind of gasoline called eve Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline was Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes they haven't completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there were also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really gonna make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of those really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act or they said no relief that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy I so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight and I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this you know new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that looked pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other also the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he seemed to be walking the line\nYou know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us live though you said that there are some politician to oppose it well\nCertainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's

concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you will do on election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but\nI have voted for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do turn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognize that mention is new liberal but has defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nAfter Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen says she won't vote for mansion in November Emily ... came to a similar decision she was a public school teacher\nEven the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion come or social leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Morrisey either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us\nAll three woman so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate for my computer that voting record is a sign that mentioned is an independent thinker computer was a democratic state lawmaker for mentions home in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted him to do and and and they did they acted accordingly\nOr some people just don't be happy about that and some slowing me mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree a hundred percent of the time with anybody\nBut computers as mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or non affiliated voters with his vote for cabinet and computer believes mentioned as certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote

why I call false rough\nAnd that's explained in calling all mines that rough surface improves the aerodynamics and how did people discovered that they found old scuffed falls work better and then I

can understand is that\nA lot of young people work with computers now and I wonder ... if you think of coding as a kind of invention\nIs definitely an invention what I've talked about my other books such as the autistic brain and thinking in pictures I've talked about different kinds of thinking\nSome people are visual thinkers like me who thinking photo realistic pictures everything is a picture and then there's other people that thinking patterns more mathematical those are the people do ... coding they're more the mathematical mind the musical mind and then you've got other people that think completely in war\nAnd their scientific evidence that these different kinds of minds excess but I'm getting worried that our school system screening out a lot of our visual thinker like me 'cause we absolutely can't do algebra but I worked with brilliant skilled trades people right here in Colorado on projects I did it in a big beef plants here\nAnd I think today some of these people they know diagnosed dyslexic maybe ADHD maybe mildly autistic\nAnd they could make all kinds of complicated things out of metal\nAnd I'm worried that we're losing these kids necessarily need um no I'm really concerned I was just talking to a mom this morning and our daughter that came in and visit with me\nAnd on their school up in Wyoming and just taking out the automobile shop class and I go that's the worst thing you could do\nYou need to shovel thinkers let's take your iPhone for example young Steve Jobs was an artist he was probably on the autism spectrum an artist made the interface which makes your phone easy to kill the engineers the mathematical engineers had to make the inside of that phone work so that's the two different kinds of minds working to get\nRight and then there's the mind like mine which is totally word base which might work on you know the predictive text or the translation of something that's ... that's why you're in radio [laughter] uh it's interesting I

EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California there are more details emerging about the disappearance of Saudi journalist democracy Yogi in Turkey cars so gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance this team\nOf fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate\nThe post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this in a stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point of view learn more facts here\nAnd uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a describe them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence service says identified several of the men some they say our military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV meanwhile are airing footage\nOf ... entering that constantly on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later a heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nX. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search for one of the two points on that both the planes\nWell that's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bone so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that this Yogi was spirited out of the country\nI don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today and there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could this due to the relationship with your country\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more put to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case\nSo far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh Cosby us investigators to join the probe are happening uh we'll see if something like that occurs\nNPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company and the US's encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nMobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate change in carbon ...\nInto the atmosphere ExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBernstein says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why doesn't oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile since says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon evidence plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully ... to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's been Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but ... says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it are Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and says President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal send acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort but he says he thinks his group's carbon dividend proposal will become viable sooner than many people expect John Ydstie NPR News Washington\nThis is NPR News\n\nThis new CPR news Mike lamp and next to this morning CPR is John daily on a ballot measure in Denver that would raise money for healthy food
