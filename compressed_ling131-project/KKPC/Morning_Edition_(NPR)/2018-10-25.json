markets sounds pretty darned bad what's going on [noise]\nWe'll try this kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's

derail his effort to encourage foreign investment in his country\nThat's right in fact he's headlining a major conference that wraps up in Riyadh today it's called the future investment initiative and it's part of this attempt by Saudi Arabia to position itself as a place for new investment under a young energetic crown prince but a lot of business and finance leaders pulled out after ... death\nRight and meanwhile the Washington Post is reporting that CIA director Gina Haspel now in Turkey has listened to surveillance tape of cars showed jeeze killing\nIf true that confirms the claim by Turkish investigators that such a tape exists and it also gives greater weight to Turkey's claims\nThat this was a premeditated murder committed by Saudi Arabia now bench shoe is economics editor of the independent the British newspaper he is in Riyadh at this conference and I asked him what the atmosphere has been like\nWhen it was a day of high drama and onto the patient yesterday because these were the first comments by the crown prince since the murder of a hustle gee idea of this month\nAnd the whole here in Riyadh at the convention center was absolutely packed not a new report says but we've\nUm Saudi officials and business leaders whole ... ... the crown prince who's the de facto router of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to them a while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect as a heinous crime he said that there would be\nA old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because\nI thought she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul and he stuck it very defiant notes saying that those who are trying to drive to sweat will not succeed not well I Am crown prince while my father is king\nWhile president at the gun is president of turkey and I think the context of the ... they're all those who feel the his position in Saudi Arabia so they thought through is under threat I think this was a message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were a high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because these allegations is that absence being felt\nThe absence is being felt in terms of some of the media partnerships and some of the high profile speakers inside of the high profile pilots moderate says that said the west in business a executives had just not the ones at the top of the organizations who went on the original billing\nUm I have to say that keeping quite so low key profile here I think there's a sense of\nTrepidation a sense of they don't know why this is going to go I have to say I also have spoken to some of them and they all sticking to the original vision they think that this is a passing storm and ah although the you know it was a mistake and the uh the the ... just as the company said must be brought to justice than not losing faith in the original\nVision he laid out two years ago is this event really important to Saudi Arabia this investment conference I think it's hugely important it's

power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal
