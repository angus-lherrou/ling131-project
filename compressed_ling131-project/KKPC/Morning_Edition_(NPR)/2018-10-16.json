Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the you know raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this was how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described a conversation he had with Saudi king selmont about what happened to showcase\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it [noise] you didn't really know maybe I don't want to get ... but it sounded to me like they did a big role ... getting to the bottom of it very serious but it is really a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did the denial\nI've asked other firmly denies us while he denies that mean Roy Moore denies it and by the way it gives a total denial\nI Will tell you that President Bush was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials have king selmont Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls

be somewhat jarring coming from the president because traditionally American presidents have been more restrained but with Trump the filter as off\nMy sense is that he's relying on some stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on to make a statement about an issue that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on or doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment is LA is certainly acceptable we want to get to the bottom of rivers that if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get

NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep wire us arms sales to Saudi Arabia such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to hold us weapons deals over it\nJennifer spin dollar's an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us come on a\nGood morning thanks for having major ... what does the U.S sell the Saudis exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia on precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were covering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which that American transport but right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are pretty inefficient employment mechanism part of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics\nThat means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia had signed a six billion dollar deal for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals I'm about two and a number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for a very important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in the U.S interest is it possible to halt arms sales even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to a friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama in August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer spend del thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about flashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are connected to the environment Congress has largely largely gone along for the ride that may change though

so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied or in part to federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is a very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what Elizabeth Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you or when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a tribe but I have Indian ancestry\n[noise] it does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her\nA family story [noise] um and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about and so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have very specific\nAh means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're a sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific in the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nMany of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly a extinguished by the government United States\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she's been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country our because the needs are there\nAnd we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat at so I don't think he does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to to talk about in Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this is an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country are there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nOf ... in in some ways it's been positively made a lot of strides in health care um but there's a lot of uncertainty for\nExample in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with us over changes to that agency that's so critical it concerns us at times when there's proposed budgets that reduced things that are important to us things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation or education and things of that matter so\nUm we need we need a federal government that will listen to try that will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations uh and so we think the\nFederal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the president United States attacks US Senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA DNA results\nWill miss Ross Kim thanks very much really appreciate it thanks very much Steve\n... is the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma\n\nThis is NPR

NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday\nThat would require drug makers to reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will let me\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we'd need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says the advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right\nRight exactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pay maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to fill so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often and ... are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but\nWould it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing right consumers right so if I'm told that my drug is five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scare you away from getting a drug\nRight so um even though it's it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that ... price transparent San Fran scripts and drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for young we start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up to the minute and say in the form it from single industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group pharma and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nUm help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs to bark drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me what is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo I'm ... even if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration as administration how to enforce that [noise]\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the\nChain them and then they're going to expect the other companies to each other or consumers to sue the company so no ... more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\n[noise] there is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a journalist but the Saudis may already be paying a price NPR's John Ydstie reports on what it means the businesses are backing away\nIn twenty sixteen crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon Saudi Arabia is effective ruler invited us and global businesses

E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase has said he wanted to and again Jacob Kirkegaard\nI think the fact that as CEO as prominent as you know J. P. Morgan Jamie diamond not going to the summit and saying so publicly and linking it to the ... disappearance means that many other CEOs will probably pull out\nTo other prominent Wall Street CEOs Larry fink of black rock and Steve Schwartzman of the Blackstone group also say they won't be attending\nAccording to the New York times the trio of CEOs tried but failed to get the Saudis to postpone the conference the CEOs also reportedly failed to convince treasury secretary Steven ... to stay home\nThe ... the allegations along with previous behavior of the crown prince are making companies nervous security guard\nHe says remember that back in twenty Seventeen the crown prince rounded up four hundred Saudi princes and businesspeople detained them at the Ritz Carlton and re odd on corruption charges and force them to pay the government as much as a hundred billion dollars\nI mean he basically sending the signal that the rule of law in Saudi Arabia is amiss when you're trying to lure foreign investors into your country that is about the worst signal you could possibly send them\nBut Karen young a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute says U.S companies who ... the Saudis will likely pay a price because the Saudis will take it personally\nThe decision on the part of the U.S corporate to walk away from this conference and to in some ways you know turn it back on the Saudi Government as a partner will not be forgotten by the Saudis\nYoung says it could be two decades before the Saudis will re engage with these companies\nYoung also says us sanctions against the Saudis could be tricky there's lots of Saudi money and us tech real estate and stock market she says and the Saudis on lots of US government bonds not to mention the country's key role in the oil markets so the Saudis have ways to retaliate\nJohn Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nWe're raising funds here at Colorado Public radio and asking you to add your support with the gift of any amount need a little extra push to take care of that right now when you joined is a member today\nYou're automatically entered to win a trip for two to one\nWith seven nights in the city if you when you have plenty of time to go out on the town taking the sites or even take day trips outside of the city\nThe London trip package has no set I ten or every other than a nonstop British Airways flight out of the IRA and seven nights at a four star in one town\nYou'll also have mode of transportation\nAnd five hundred dollar credit on a travel site tickets to the trip is what you want to make it\nKind of like your membership you choose the donation among [noise]\nAfter the without a gift to win a trip for two to wonder if you find simply rules and highlights at P.
