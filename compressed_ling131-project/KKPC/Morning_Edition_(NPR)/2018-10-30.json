stopped me one night he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked at me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about the deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour

Trump plans to move roughly five thousand us troops\nTo the border at rallies for Republican candidates this fall the president has explicitly port the distant caravan at the center of the election campaigns and elections seemed to be continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people on the bridge when you looked at that wage loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country\nThe president was apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles away from the United states\nWith that said there is a group of several thousand migrants with varying descriptions of its size and purpose to check the latest facts we called journalist David ... who was recently with that group and we asked first if it is getting near the U.S\n[noise] no not at all it it's still a\nProbably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is cheap wanna which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit a more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around ... of the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states\nWho said that Mexican authorities or try to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined and size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself ...\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily mirrors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not was just based because on the number of people that they were serving\nA because they're obviously providing a lot of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nThe okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves had a they tend to have a nightly assembly were they when they arrive in a in a in a village what they'll do is they'll\nThey'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly when which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was so both of them will do their best to get to the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there is no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably move their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days less\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states um all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person can cross the border and just wanted to be\nCloser to the

going to get new jobs get business is growing and a lot of these other problems are much easier to solve\nBut that's the answer to people who are particularly focused on the deficit is give it some time the editor oath will bring it down yep\nBut Trump has given us a lot higher growth already now look Republicans have done a terrible job of controlling spending and I'm the first one to point the

spending bills Trump takes a lot of criticism from conservatives for not talking about Medicare and Social Security which is you know is a big part of adding bicycled entitlement programs my feeling as one of the reasons Donald Trump won the election is precisely because he said he wasn't going to cut Social Security and Medicare\nSo I mean when you step back from this though is the Trump

S. L. dot edu\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California so how do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gain traction either well thanks for having me so what's a good example of how this works a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up a ... on started the darkest uh the edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and I you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off as sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a mess was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it worked its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics absolutely\nPeople don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the mean enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of theories worked their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so\nAh the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast and you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to it by the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\nWill will what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains incentives for the job of of the press to not these things down should fall to social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when a depressed tries to fact check things you often end up and amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies but\nYou know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think that companies right now are airing more on the side of uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or is this always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and ... even before that\nBut it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforced one another's belief in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it ethics rather\nOdds makers identified dozens of congressional districts that are in play as it's said could go either\nAnd will determine which party wins the house this fall one of those seats is the second district of Maine it's voters supported President Trump in two thousand sixteen but supported President Obama just four years before that let's travel there with NPR's Brian Naylor\nThe second district of Maine stretches across a vast swaths of the state was deeply wooded forests and small fishing villages\nMostly rural it's not just the main of lobsters and light houses but more hard Scrabble was shuttered mills and one of the worst opioid problems in the nation\nDemocrats think it could swing blue again one afternoon last week their candidate Jared Golden greeted workers at the afternoon shift change at the verse so paper mill in Jay\n... is a thirty six year old former marine\nWho signed up after nine eleven and served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in an interview at a nearby hospital golden said his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the ADA a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that we're talking voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by Republican incumbent Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold ... government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still billing taxes we reached out to poet ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term and that's the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you when I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a an attack me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for ... for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate pollock when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in a tweet refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twice sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody way before\nI ask golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't view\nMy role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something her main I'm going to stick up for our state\nAccording to the center for Responsive Politics the two major candidates and parties and political action committee supporting them have dropped over eight million dollars into the district\nTo independence in the race or not expected to be a factor but could be because of a wild card may now has ranked choice voting and federal elections mark brewer is a political science professor at the University of Maine\nIf you were to go and get your ballots um today and vote you would be you'd be given the option to rank those four candidates one through four one being your top choice in for being your last choice\nIf no candidate receives a majority the last place finisher is eliminated their votes would then go to whomever they eliminated Kennedy's voters ranked as their second choice no one knows for certain how this will play out\nPublic when has refused to say whether he'll honor the results should lose Brian Naylor NPR News Lewiston, Maine [noise]\n\nThis is NPR
