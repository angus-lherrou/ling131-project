treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor turns out that the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform\nSay the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports from home\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase Abou dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate Baylor sb ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state after all ... and fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system\nThe size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the racist system of mass incarceration they just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nRoutine believes this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded ... argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will kill the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder SP ten now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to youth detention to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have re similar concerns the\nBill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data that algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact of police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse\nOr that's very factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm

Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Kim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nThey actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show\nOr good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that they they uh uh of decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and they're concerned that California's meddling with a federal policy\nWell how effective it is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue as interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that\nUh the the uh the broadband providers in California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nIn about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's a but California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid says and dozens of other states are considering that mentality laws me\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality love it you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is\nOne of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically feeling gaps\nThe federal government has abandoned and neutrality for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states or feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is a really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish and in California we should note his is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is a dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes and so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or\nReally national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them on the they've all said they they like and that neutrality law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or AT and T. we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans won the child the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the ... the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school I think so much time been a pleasure\nHow much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat is President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets\nAnd set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the ... the largest union in the U.S in her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nWould make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages which are not invited\nHave a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws [noise]\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require auto makers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists had bound is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nThere are some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says in next to us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build up mobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal Yuki Noguchi NPR News Washington\n[noise]\nIt's NPR news\nI'm Kelley Walker from CPR classical what makes a classical music composer great one measurement is impact

James thank you so much for your reporting on this we appreciate it\nA coat frankly\nWhen California became the first state to abolish cash bail late this summer\nGovernor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor\nTurns out though the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports or\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney Jason ... dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state\nAfter all beaming fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system the size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor people of color often end up on the losing end but there's deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood I was disappointed\nAnd I felt betrayed\nThe new sb ten doesn't actually change the racist system of mass incarceration they just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nBetween believes this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a subsection five that section so broadly worded ... argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will tip the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder SP ten now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to youth detention to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have race similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney racing says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact of police stop search decaying arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse\nOr this very factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan of the notes that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should also a write off being I I can I add up like they shouldn't they were people being needlessly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who said there'll be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court\nAs soon as it takes effect next year Eric Westervelt NPR News San Francisco this
