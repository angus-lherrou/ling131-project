Inskeep leaders of the u._k. is conservative party are meeting today prime minister Theresa May gives a speech and just as a last year's version of the same meeting she has tried to get her party behind some plan for Brexit in just two weeks she is supposed to meet with the European Union leaders and find a new plan that they will accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt is covering all of this Hi there Frank ... is this moment any more desperate than all the other times the conservatives have gotten the failed to agree well\nAt the time is running out as you point out I think that's what his creating a lot of tension here\nIs there's not a lot of time left on an incredibly difficult and intricate negotiation of the problem for the prime minister has been\nShe can't that the European Union to agree to replant and many people in her own party up there in Birmingham they don't agree with the plan either ... can have a speech today a lot of it's gonna be about domestic policy but she's she needs to appear strong and confident\nAs the country goes into what many stories would say is the biggest challenge making them has faced since World War two ah so that's she's going to be coming on actually very soon and we'll be hearing what she has to say\nWhat has her critics said\nWell she has a lot of critics but the probably the most prominent one is a man named Boris Johnson he's the former foreign minister\nHe's frankly seen as widely gunning for a ... job and he gave a big speech yesterday where he trashed her plan to leave the European Union she calls for one for more closer relationship with the youth still be able to trade goods seamlessly he\nCalled this a cheat an outrage not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen he'd like to see a sharp break with the European Union a more independent and independent Britain and and here's what he said yesterday\nIf we get it wrong army proceed with these on democratic solution\nIf you made in ... we will\nPer trapped these talks the tedious isn't toxic tedious business it certainly is toxic how does the prime minister respond to\nThat well she put him down gently uh yesterday on the on the TV he she said Boris and that's not how everybody refers to him he's a major figure here always puts on a good show one of her criticisms is that the plan that Mr Johnson's putting out there\nUh she says doesn't really address the need to avoid a new hard border on the island of Ireland this is a huge issue we've been talking about right now as as you know Steve the borders seamless you can't even see it people and goods flow freely across in the Irish people in Ireland they they want it that way\nUm there's a real concern that it could change and she one of the reasons she's trying to continue to have good going back and forth with the EU is to avoid a border of any kind\nOf behind these details I have an image Frank Langfitt of an ocean liner I don't know maybe the Titanic had imported iceberg and you've got several people jostling for control of the wheels Boris Johnson being one of them what if what rank and file conservative thinking is\nWell I I think that for the moment I think they're going to stick with prime minister may it's it's sort of hard to imagine given the stakes here that they would switch horses in midstream and wall Mr Johnson is a very good performer in terms of speeches there there are concerns that he's not the right guy\nFor such a delicate time I was talking to a man named Anthony Martin he's the chairman of east Hampshire conservative association and and here's how he put it yesterday in Birmingham\nHe would be great to have the big picture great inspiring people but he would need to have a long day and we can deal with the south\nWould you want to see him as a future hand [noise] yes and no I'm undecided I Am a supporter of or if you don't [noise] but he he's a law my character you either love him on the um\n... character seven hits it's an expression here in the United kingdom Martin ... is this sticky dark brown foods bread and it's probably Britain's most divisive food product\nWell suppose they get on the same page and come up with a plan is there any chance that the Europeans are going to accept the ... [noise]\nWell that's that's a very good question and we what was interesting to see it as we haven't seen a new plan they sent her back to the drawing board or the leaders in Brussels and we're waiting to see what she's going to come up with negotiations right now seems stalled\nUm and we just got to meeting two weeks to go um and the concern is if they don't come up with a deal they could uh you take a crash out of the you could do a lot of damage to the economy here\nNPR's Frank Langfitt always a pleasure talking with his are happy to do it Steve\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nIn the days of the Cold War was pretty common to hear this announcement\nTV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University says testing system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the public\nBut this is where Dr Read lender has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe share of the fact that the president might be using such a shift for political purposes or get Craig diversion if he felt the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real search either be so what about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed a suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and that wants to turn people cell phones into government loud speakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert\nSystem is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message and besides has Twitter for that\nBrian Naylor NPR News Washington [noise]\nAnd coming up later today on all things considered we'll hear from one of the

I don't know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and vote for him right\nI think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob as she'll be American Constitution society effect so much and\nKeep a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele kill them in\nA State Department official says marriage equality is below the land here in the U.

speech last night in Mississippi the president shifted to mocking Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault but didn't recall every detail\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise] the president's mockery\nCame at the same time that the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check years and it's not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described rather than from falls but if a sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to catch\nThat this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations what it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents are the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit uh some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his arm so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we should investigate thoroughly\nTrump Lee is a retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar attacks by the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Barton costs the NPR

Downing Street and that's something they absolutely don't want to say\nFrank thanks very much happy to do it Steve NPR's Frank Langfitt\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather at the test and the new nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the ... on this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so on broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nNow some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having a testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president can be able to speak directly to the public\nBut this is where a doctor redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe shattered effect that the president might be using such a shift them for political purposes or get trade a diversion of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concern here I I Would be so what about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and that wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening famous\nSays that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message\nAnd decides he has Twitter for that\nBrian Naylor NPR News Washington [noise]\nAnd\nComing up later today on all things considered we'll hear

death toll from last week's earthquake and tsunami to more than fourteen hundred people teams are still finding bodies under heavy debris on the island to sue the last eight NPR's Julie McCarthy has reached the provincial capital and says Indonesians are increasingly desperate for aid\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they wear black robes and they sit behind\nA lectern said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nWe except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing anything what is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have ...\nHim on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand\nIt some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something\nOf course you're going to have passion about it but his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era we are not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nOr it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom the judge would be shocked\nUm so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would file a motion to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I ... I don't know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nAll because President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and vote for him right\nI think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society thanks so much thank\nYou a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele kill them in a State Department\nOfficial says marriage equality is the law of the land here in the U.S so when it comes to granting visas the U.S is now treating same sex couples the same as heterosexual couples with limited exceptions diplomatic visas will now only be granted you legal spouses\nOn the face of it this sounds fair says ... Kamara of human rights watch but she worries the U.S is ignoring reality\nSame sex marriages only legal in twenty five countries\nAnd perhaps more concerning in over Seventy countries around the world same sex conduct is illegal it criminalized it's been hunted by throwing people in jail by beating like eating a lot of countries how can we ignore that when we make policy here in the United states\nShe's expecting a lot of shot gun weddings which she fears could but some diplomats at risk back home diplomats and un officials are already here have until the end of the year to produce a marriage certificate if they want their partners to maintain their visa status\nThey could be exempted if the country they represent respect the rights of Americans at embassies abroad but as ... points out staff at international organizations or in a different category what's really\nInequitable I think is that the U.S in a World Bank or other international organization that don't have that option because\nThere is nothing that those organizations can offer the Trump Administration and return\nState Department officials who only spoke on background said they will work with individuals on a case by case basis\nThey say there are only a hundred and five families in the U.S who will be impacted by this at fifty five of them at international organizations and the officials at most are from countries that do recognize same sex marriage Michele ...

that are some that are all kind of in a tangled Web involved with Medicaid expansion which equals bureaucratic turf wars but I Would say a hick puff\nIs the largest entity that's responsible for the expansion of Medicaid um I think we need to look at how that process has unfolded through audits not to blame anybody but there have been problems with double billing there'd been unequal reimbursement payments are there have been people that have taken advantage of the system or in order to enrich their corporate interests\n'cause you when you know you have the government is the

inherited fortune much of which was shielded from taxes through a variety of questionable schemes\nNew York taxing authorities say they're reviewing the articles findings\nIn his tweet the president does not dispute any of the facts and the article ... describes it as quote a very old boring and often told hippies Trump complained to the vast majority of the newspapers coverage of his

share of the cost of coverage increase that's according to a new study and fears Alison Kojak reports the average price for a family plan is close to twenty thousand dollars a year\nTo report from the Kaiser Family foundation showed that the price of employer provided health insurance rather than average five percent this year\nEmployees' contribution to those premiums fell slightly in twenty Eighteen but over the last five years employees Sharon has risen by about a thousand dollars on top of that more workers have to cover picker deductibles\nPeople who work for small companies usually pay more for their coverage than those who work for bigger firms about a third of those who work for small business cover more than half their insurance premiums premiums also increase faster than inflation and workers earnings\nSo altogether that means that health insurance costs are taking up an ever larger share of people take home pay\nAlison kinda jak and parenting is\nThe federal

time of the national crisis if the country's under attack or an imminent natural disaster and it can't be used by the president for other purposes\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he said the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his huge eyes and and as and you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke\nAnd then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonalds turning toward him with and waving a nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his wife lights that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dashcam video\nAnd I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court routes watchers through the first two weeks of trial or do you think than dogs can take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to bring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how the cross examination go well um\nWhen bombs or Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nVan Dyke to not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nIt as an initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually describe in great detail alleged movements by requiring McDonald the wave of the knife raising the knife and and it describes officer Van Dyke backpedaling from Guam and Donald none of those things are on the dash cam video\nPatrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago is covering this trial and his

[noise]\nA Frank I suppose it must seem to be in Britain's national interest since she's demanding such good terms that there's no indication she can get them hasn't the European Union already said it won't accept this deal\nWell they have and that's why I think domestically this sounds good but it doesn't seem to fully recognize what the European Union has said and the other challenge that she faces ears that\nShe may have trouble getting a deal like this through parliament given that there was a lot of people in our own party who are against it now she got a couple more weeks these uh before there's this other meeting in Brussels to hammer out an agreement\nAnd you've got to wonder if there might be a compromise down the line although that could be embarrassing given the kind of speech that she just gave the was adamant that you can have the free movement of goods without accepting you workers that would break the rules of the club and eventually people in the ... think it would lead to this integration of the union\nFrank and I just tell you something that I hear from people here as we talk to your periodically you tell us essentially the same story that the British are proposing unrealistic terms that they can get and they go back to square one again and somebody will be listening to that story and say to me have they thought of maybe just voting again on whether they really want to do breakfast\nYeah that that comes up here as well and that is in the newspapers in the conversation there are some polls that have shown a small change\nBut also if you look at the polls actually people are more entrenched in some ways than they were back in two thousand and sixteen I was out in Liverpool last week talked to more than ... people I found only one person who has shifted their opinion\nAnd today is before a prime minister may she was adamant that there's going to be no re runs of two thousand and sixteen this is what she said\nI'm second referendum would be a politician than politicians sending people when the time and should try again thanks so no one would do just say in all of\nIt is really interesting the conservative party leaders including the likes of may have set all along there not total fans of this Brexit thing but they want to respect the will of the people and that's what I guess you said again what else did she say in a speech\nWell it's interesting ... it was actually the smallest part of the speech it mostly was focusing on his domestic agenda jobs the confidence of the conservative party which previously it's definitely been known for as well as just even the diversity of her own cabinet\nAnd that's because breakfast has been really divisive for the party it's been a mill stone around the neck of conservatives in last week I was the Labour Party conference up in Liverpool and they were very they seem pretty United they felt like a government party and waiting and may and the other conservatives I think they know they need to stick together\nTheir worst nightmare is being forced into a general election and losing to the Labour Party and I would put labor's leader Jeremy Corbyn he's a socialist in number ten Downing Street and that's something they absolutely don't want to see\nFrank thanks very much happy to do it Steve NPR's Frank Langfitt\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use

War it was pretty ...\nTo hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the ... on this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon

that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI carrying the testing of this new wireless emergency alerts just is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president can be able to speak directly to the public\nBut this is where Dr Read lender has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her if a president might be using such a shift them for political purposes or it create a diversion of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure you're right it would be so what about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and that wants to turn people cell phones into government loud speakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message\nAnd besides he has Twitter for that\nBrian Naylor NPR News Washington [noise]\nAnd\nComing up later today on all things considered we'll hear
