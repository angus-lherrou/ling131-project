Republican Democrat\nBut he was never the most liberal candidate in Wisconsin primary and at a recent rally he had with Bernie Sanders some Democrats in the crowd like dealing fair weather we're not exactly sure if they would put Sanders fevers or anything but\nThat might go ahead do you say\nWe even if he's trying to do is happy new a distinct Wisconsin version of progressive politics the state has had a long tradition of economic population and he's an actor is that we didn't even campaign talking about Medicaid expansion and a Fifteen dollar minimum wage\nAnd we're going to get every middle class\nFamily and the state of Wisconsin at ten percent break on their income taxes because\nThose are the people that have been struggling all\n[noise] even a vision of progressive politics is about standing up to big business and ensuring average people get a voice in government and hundreds of miles to the south in Florida there's another guy running for governor who shares is concerned

win in a state like mine but I think our primary race really blew that to shreds\nGillum also wants to repeal the state's controversial stand your ground law the law gives Floridians the right to act in self defense even to the point of using deadly force\nAnd in my state where I live the law is such that you can go antagonize pushed the bay or start a fight and then hide behind stand your ground

DC President Trump is thrust a caravan of migrants to the center of the Republican election campaign\nThough it is still far from the U.S border the care of Amazon Mexican soil and our next guest represents the country with responsibility for just now Iran will go to the artist is Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador good morning\nGood morning Steve I I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this the view of your government\nWell what we're facing here Steve is really a humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things are urging people to winter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then F offering refugee status to all those people from Central America to request that including\nHealth services education and an identification what the Mexican Government want to assure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the end the phone with Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have ... trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against authority even do that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status of so police there seem to uphold our laws\nThere's for essence of the human rights commission and ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced\nYou offered them refugee status I Believe you said and yet the leader of this group seem from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who\nAre invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with a sign of well\nOut of uh the the number that we have a store on three thousand five hundred people\nAre out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugee status\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact end up requesting to stop this because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of ...\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand I mention of for fire no regional pro through five thousand have already a percent that their request for refugee status\nOr this is important in front of us perspective investor because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are cheerleading tend to get to the U.S and we have coast corporation where U.S authorities to handle this in the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official theories of the people that are still in the Caribbean and such\nIs around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps\nAnd around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and this the situation continues to evolve and uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we want to assure that are these ... that migration is scandal legally safe and ordered\nAmbassador thanks very much for the time really appreciate it on the contrary Steve thank you for the space around I'm Olga terrorists as Mexico's ambassador to the United states\nThe killings at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh follow what the Anti Defamation league says is an historic fifty seven percent rise in anti Semitic incidents from twenty sixteen to twenty Seventeen it was the biggest single year increase in the group started tracking such data almost forty years ago Here's NPR's Eric Westervelt\nThe twenty nine federal charges suspected gunman Robert Bauer spaces include eleven hate crime counts of murdering people engaging in the free exercise of their religious beliefs FBI statistics show that anti Semitism was the motivator for more than half of all reported anti religious hate crimes and twenty six\nThe most recent your data is available it doesn't appear Bowers was known to law enforcement he did have a history of anti Semitic and anti immigrant social media posts online he accused a nonprofit founded by Jews that now help refugees of all stripes of bringing quote invaders in kill our people\nAdding screw your optics I'm going in the reality is that words have consequences\nGeorge ... is a former senior department of homeland security official he's now the ... vice president of programs a recent eighty I'll report shows that online attacks on Jews have continued to surge during this year's midterm elections that what was once relatively rare online harassment is today commonplace\nCeiling directed homeland security's programs to counter violent extremism he left government citing hyper partisanship divisions he says that have only gotten deeper and public debate more vitriolic since he left a year ago\nWhen anti Semitic rhetoric ... dog whistling or rhetoric that of a extreme nature\nIs really allowed in our public square without condemnation especially from the highest leaders who are public officials it really gives the green light to anti Semite big it's you know folks in a slum foods to keep spouting it an acting on it\nPresident Trump has called for unity and denounce spoke the synagogue murders and the recent mailing of explosive devices to prominent Democrats\nThe ATM notes that public anti Semitism has gone up markedly in the wake of Trump's election win at last year's infamous unite the Right rally that turned violent in Charlottesville neo Nazis paraded chanting Jews will not replace us the president cited blame on both sides\nRepublicans including the president have recently without evidence accused Jewish Democratic Party donor George Soros of financially backing the caravan of Central American migrants heading toward the U.S border\nSoros was one of the Trump critics targeted by mail bombs last week today she continues to be the target of conspiracy and GOP mid term attack ads\nTony ... is a former Holocaust denial and recruiter for the white Aryan resistance he co founded the group life after hate that works to reform races he says he's pretty busy these days more people are expressing themselves in public he says in ways they never did before\nI think it's important to remember that well by far right ideology appears to live on the fringes it is very informed by the mainstream\nMeckler says it might not feel right to talk about it right now I'm at all the grief and anger over the synagogue murders but he says the thing that pulled him out of his bubble of hate and loading was the compassion of others a mirror that allowed him to see his own humanity Eric Westervelt NPR News\n...

just spoke to watch\n[noise] thanks for being with us that's Rick after geo physics professor it's cs you his team recently discovered an Arctic has singing ice shelf way\n\nIt's flu season people in fact I've already been hospitalized today we're going to go back in time though a hundred years ago the fall of Nineteen Eighteen when a flu pandemic hit the entire planet killing tens of millions of people\nWhat's more one theory is that it started just over the Colorado State law and talked to a ritual early he if Colorado State epidemiologist she's going to show this history with us why did the flu season of Nineteen Eighteen become a global pandemic\nSo certainly one of the factors was really the time the era and this was in the middle of World War one and so there was a lot of movement of of troops that was really sort of unprecedented for the time that really resulted in transmission across the globe of this virus\nOkay uh that kind of movement is probably is unlike anything the world is seen to the point that is correct what made it spread so quickly beyond that\nYou know any kind of an influenza pandemic it it means that there's a new influenza virus that individuals do not really have an existing immune response to and it can easily spread from person to person it can really result in much greater rates of hospitalization or even mortality\nSo as we were researching this topic we found that this pandemic really hits home for people we were discussing it around our editorial meeting and my colleague Andrea Dukakis recalls the effect on her family\nMy father's side of the family were Greek immigrants and\nI'd always heard about the Nineteen Eighteen flu epidemic because shortly after they arrived in the U.S\nThe epidemic head and um everyone was sick in the family my great grandfather died so did the oldest brother in the family and I heard stories about carts being driven around towns and picking up dead bodies everyone was just terrified of getting sec\nYeah so there are lots of different stories that come out of Colorado history books one particular community that but the very hard hit was silver ten Colorado and silver ten obviously had a large mining population\nAnd during the Nineteen Eighteen pandemic it was really that population of twenty to forty year old that were hardest hit I think it was a large percentage of the ... community the mining community\nAnd during the pandemic their stories of hundreds of deaths occurring in silver Ken I'm In one night alone can that's occurring city hall was converted to a makeshift hospital to house people they didn't have enough resources to deal with a dead bodies fleas and the city\nReally to have medical personnel sent to the towns that says\nDid you find it there were big differences and how the flu hit different communities in Colorado and how they responded\nAbsolutely so Gunnison things very differently from silver tenant other communities in Colorado\nI'm very early on establish themselves very strict quarantine requirements that they put up barricades to the city they did not allow cars to pass through they stopped trains anyone that want it to get off and gone and had to go into a force quarantine for several days\nI'm close schools very early lots of strict measures in place that that did ultimately protect the town of Gunnison\nOkay one theory is that the Nineteen Eighteen flu originated just over the Colorado border in Kansas\nYeah so the the pandemic occurred in several ways largest wave you mentioned was the second wave the fall of Nineteen Eighteen but earlier in the spring including as early as of January there were documented cases that occurred in the town of Haskell Kansas that were very unusual to the the medical provider that ... that was taken care of these patients\nAnd then we also know that individuals from that community then later on moved to afford to near Manhattan, Kansas okay where a large outbreak occurred in the spring and one of the reasons that\nHas to Kansas has been targeted is not only did those early cases appear but\nHaskell and that area of the country are really part of a large migratory flight way and there's lots of research has shown that this virus really as of avian origin and so we believe that perhaps this came out of wild birds then within domesticated birds and then transmitted to humans\nAre that's fascinating now could the pandemic of Nineteen Eighteen could happen again\nSo certainly I think we are always vulnerable to pandemics I think one of the helpful things we have now is antibiotics so a lot of the cases that occurred in Nineteen Eighteen were the influenza virus costs secondary bacterial in pneumonia and so we now have antibiotics to treat those individually also of course have vaccine and anti viral medications\nSo lots of things now that I'm I think would decrease the transmission of respect\nFor being with us absolutely thinking there's a ritual Hurley he

has ... good morning David so significant moment here ... speaking to the nation about her decision what what is your saying\nShe she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith in her government on and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nWell I feel like I'm you and I have talked um countless times about miracle and some of the challenges and in calling her times embattled I mean she and her government have been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in twenty Fifteen rights away the evil wise why we arrived at this moment now what's different\nWell there's been a steady chipping away at her support ah basically on a national level but also in regional elections is this really dogged her in her party and her allies ah especially\nAh the the most recent ones we can talk about where last night's election or or yesterday's election I should say and has to which is where Frank for is the big financial center and also two weeks before Bavaria some serious losses where in last night's or the count basically her party barely is hanging on to power with the coalition of greens\nAre and in Bavaria they I mean it's it's also really shaken up the the the variant allies of Mrs ... which are uh the the Christian social union members have been there and the conservatives if you will\nSo I mean she's been so central to European politics it's hard to imagine European politics without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this this is\nWell the ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation those negotiated that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's in an incredibly we can position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek reelection in ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to remain in power until uh until then but it and she's a lame duck at this point\nIn any talk of who are
