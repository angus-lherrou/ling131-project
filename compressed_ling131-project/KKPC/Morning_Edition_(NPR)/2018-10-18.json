well king last night the Washington Post published what is believed to be ... last column the Saudi journalist who was a ... regular contributor to the post was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul early this month he's\nBelieved to be a casualty of the topic he wrote about in that piece and an free press in the Arab world\nTo show the G wrote about Arab governments suppressing a free press without consequences are going to read part of that column too you know quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result the Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate\nHe goes on there was a time when journalists believe the Internet would liberate information from the censorship and control associated with print media\nBut these governments who's very existence relies on the control of information have aggressively blocked the Internet they've also arrested local reporters and pressured advertisers to harm the revenue of specific publications\nNow earlier I spoke to ... editor at the Washington Post carrying a tia\nThank you so much for having me\nIn a new to readers above the column you wrote that showed jeeze translator sent you this piece a day after he was reported missing when did you realize that that it was the time to publish it\nFor me personally you know earlier this week\nI think with the news reports and of course you know sort of evidence of of proof of life coming I'm from either the Turkish or the Saudi side [noise]\nAh we just decided that now is the week at the time to do it I I think also has the story is moving to a more geopolitical story a story about us Saudi relations um goal for relations I think we just decided that it was good to bring\nThe story back um to jog among uh who Jamal was and and his ideas\nWhen you talk to him about what was happening back home what did he say how was he struggling with that beyond just beyond writing about it what other steps did he want to take\nThem very often I mean this last comic standing very often in his pieces that he wrote for the post he would call attention to 'em reformers\nAnd activists who are also being detained and and jailed um so I think for him um it was keeping a awareness on on these these people and these are just the people that we know about you know there are hundreds if not thousands of others\nWho have been detained or or disappeared under under crown prince Mohammed bin ... so I think he\nHeats the definitely saw that um this is something he he didn't agree with and he he always used to say Saudi Arabia ... was not always like this\nDid he ever talk to you know a man who spent most of his life in Saudi Arabia did he ever talk about having friends or colleagues who still supported the regime and and how difficult that that must have been\nSure and I again I mean Jamal himself even was not this this revolutionary and none of his pieces that he call for\nYou know overthrow or anything um he was somebody who who even in his his work and his long career believed 'em in in a way of working within\nThe system and so you know as far as our conversations about um the pain that people who support that he he wasn't really ... in our conversation isn't really pain so much about that he was just sort of and and\nAnd pain in general about the direction Saudi Arabia was taking and the ... I think you'd really struggled to understand why people who even supported a public supported\nUm crown prince Mohammed bin ... reforms were still finding themselves surveilled and I'm intimidated and even um detained\nWill will you remember about your friendship with democracy will\nThat um [noise] he was just a very very kind very humble and very generous person I I'll Remember I'm having just being so energized about being able to write freely I think it's just something\nIn this country in America that we take for granted I'm so much um but obviously looking back on it now realizing that he gave up so much everything his his family his his um being kicked out of jobs [noise]\nI I just I'm inspired by his his unwavering\nCommitment to I'm not only you know having freedom for himself but trying to extend that to his fellow um Arabs are writers and voices and to ... he just wanted the world the Arab world to be a better place and uh I'll never forget that\n... is the Washington Post global opinions editor Karen thank you so much\nThank you so much now among\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week if he would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame if the GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nAnd not only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the\nPresident and why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nIs Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nVote for me to vote for ... vote for me to vote for the visit vote for me\nRemember this [noise] is it about me and our agenda to make America great again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\n... [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of them\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama whose approval rating at the time was in the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're both public and incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election Trump bake more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according to a recent Pew Research center poll say Trump will be a factor in their congressional vote with a greater share saying they will be voting against the president then for him camera Keith NPR News [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nColorado Public radio and National Public radio have opened up the doors to different stories that maybe the network news is not covering and you know those driveway moments that\nThey always talk about I just laugh I'm like oh my gosh I've done that in a million times [noise]\nIt's like network news gives you the tip of the iceberg NPR gives you the iceberg [noise]\nMy name is Teresa a I live in Centennial Colorado and I've been listening to Colorado Public radio since Nineteen Ninety five and I would encourage you to support NPR and CPR because of the wealth of information that you can get from the station\nThe depth of information you can get from the station it keeps you current locally nationally\nGlobally it's just refreshing it's easy to pledge on line at CPR dot O.
