of people that can do these on ceramic pieces of beautiful yeah well I had a helper named Pablo and he was amazing and he was deported and he should be here\nSo what what do you think of President Trump in general and his approach to immigration\nUm I like it because I think he has to be that way\nIt's like what if someone who is concerned about immigrants' rights so to you how can you have it both ways how can you both support someone like Pablo and your other friends who are in the country illegally and also support President Trump who is so tough\nOn people who are in the country illegally like how can you\nHow kind of how can I put those two together are\nI don't see a chance like that I don't think I don't think they're mutually exclusive I think you could want to have good laws to protect us 'cause that's the main job with the federal government is to protect us need borders\nAnd I also think that there's room to have these people that want to come here and have a better life that they should be able to stay here\nYou know I think there should be a way that we should say you know Mr ... you need to let you know Pablo stay here he's a law abiding citizen\nAnd get the little the sleazy ones that are you know doing the trafficking and the ... open you know that's that's what we have to focus on not the people they just want to bring something to the table here I mean don't you agree\nWhat role with this with this election play\nWell I think it's it'll put more people in Congress and the Senate hopefully and it'll be able to push through Trump's agenda and I I think because the left from what I'm hearing if they get powered all they're going to do with investigations and impeach\nDots that doesn't when my heart and I think if they win that's what they're going to do and I don't think that's a good thing\nNow done a killer told me not everyone has reacted so well to her support of the president\nOh yeah I'd have people on my face with the Comey

feeling it at her middle school the morning after Trump was elected\nOn that day when I Know that so many people are just devastated and in shock and calling back into the converse I knew I didn't have the luxury of doing that because I had hundreds as Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified but what what was going them they were worried that their parents were going to be deported\nAnd some of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous\nAnd it definitely has an effect on how they learn\nIn what way when you're living in fear it's really hard to learn about things like cells and body systems and I have several students who we've been trying to get their parents to come in for conferences or to discuss their child's individualized education plan\nThat won't come because they're afraid of getting picked up and the students have shared with me and my mom doesn't have paper so we don't leave they can't they're afraid to come to school\nSheena late this is a Democrat and that's the way she's going to be voting next month for Harley router over Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher but she says what she wants most is lawmakers were willing to work with the other side\nI have to believe that there are people on both sides of the aisle that really do want to work together that this divisive mass I really\nWant to believe that that's not who we are as a nation\nBecause it's amazing just as a journalist who watches these debates from afar um it seems like so quickly\nYou are labeled as someone who just wants to protect immigrants in this country and doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nThat is how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet but if you're out there in the community and you're walking with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together then divides us\nAnd so you'd be ready to to to settle people down who were just calling the president racist and say\nThat's that's not helpful let's let's try and work through this\nI I Would do that absolutely I don't know that I Would actually be able to come out and say he's not racist but I think I can say something along the lines of continuing to push that\nNarrative is not helpful what is something that we
