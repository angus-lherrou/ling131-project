and I'm Steve Inskeep when Britain voted on Brexit in two thousand sixteen advocates for that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital the Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now is prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week was time running out\nThere is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank good morning Steve how has this story evolving\nWhat's that going very well you know ah basically there were talks over the weekend a dominant ... he's the breakfast after he flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to the premise you may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you're not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the EU for a limited time the doesn't want that they were afraid they want a guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or they'll make\nUs so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult\nProblem to solve all though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not in actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of her party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast tiers they sold this to people in the United kingdom as he was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tied their hands they say they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit years then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we ended up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch\nTheir our breakfast years who say that uh and and even prime minister may has said in the past uh no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament is going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk that there would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly do UK condom you many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens the next day\nWell now we have to see if she'll even slide to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if they haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way she's not going to risk that again\nSo we're just they'll mate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union of and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do with Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nBoth political parties in this country have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night it's not just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whacking Obamacare help President Trump shutdown them other investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to\nMaintain their majority in the house democratic will no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nIn perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to set the agenda and get bills across for\nThat will greatly affect the willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer thinks more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because what if the Democrats take it by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause she's eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding dull\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News [noise]\n\n\n[noise] Mm [noise] Mm\n\nI mean it it's this unfathomable tragedy uh but but but in some ways what's even more striking about it is how many people Neal worked with didn't even know he had ever had a daughter I mean that's how close to the best he\nHe kept that event he and Janet were fiercely private and um I think in many ways the movie especially as we did more and more research the movie kind of shifted in in my mind and I think in Ryan's mine and all of our mind from\nFrom a you know sort of mission movie about the race to the moon to a movie about grief and and coping and Neal's case a man who suffered such a profound loss that\nIn some ways you understand that his thoughts wind up just go into space go into the broader universe and and uh and maybe searching for answers that he just can't find here on earth\nShe Neil Armstrong in ... as a man pretty typical of his generation in his ability to compartmentalize his emotions plus that trust him\nI I think it was and and um we had to really rely on on people who knew him behind those closed doors people who knew the non public Neal because the public Neal yeah it was pretty reticent I'm pretty uh even seem to reclusive um of course once you get to the private Neal\nUh he was a actually a immensely complicated you know he was capable of\nGoofing off you had to really sly sense of humor and a dry wit he was also capable of a of a real you know almost sort of a scary intensity when it came to the passion with which he attacked his work and his passion for aviation I think we wanted to try to get at that vulnerability that human qualities so that you you know because\nI think he's become and the collective imagination such a poker face to almost marble statues hero but um to people like his kids he was just dead you know\nAnd to people in the neighborhood he was you know he's the guy down the street\n[noise] says you know the movie has gotten some criticism from some on the conservative side of the political spectrum who has taken issue with the fact that the film doesn't show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on them in\nSo let me ask you about that was that an intentional or mission [noise]\nAh well you know we we don't and met the American flag on the moon you see it clearly in several shots and I think this conversation about the sort of a mission has been happening or exclusively among people who haven't seen the film so I'm just really excited that the movies is opening and\nAnd that people can start seeing it and see for themselves what um the tribute I guess that we we tried to\nTo pay in the movie to what was undeniably an American enterprise and a a group of uh just American heroes I'm\nThe one other thing I'll say though is is that it's it was really important to us to try also to wherever possible focus on the untold story and and things that people didn't see and didn't know and take a very personal subjective angle on these sort of big historical events\nAre in between the things that you read about in the history books and you were actually seen the sort of stuff uh that again hopefully helps tell the human story and help show that you know these were human beings and not a\nMythological figures these were a a ordinary people doing the\nHeat as we've been talking I became a hero and an icon but you've stopped the story before we see that happening in the chronology why did you make that choice to and from where it ends with him kind of that but we don't see him um urge to like the throngs of cheering crowds [noise]\nWell it's a um we we know about the sort of a\nTickertape parades and what not um I was really surprised to learn about this time in quarantine that the astronaut spent right after coming back from\nFrom the moon had to get to actually visit back quarantine and see how small and on glamorous bedrooms word that they stayed in and and uh you know those government buildings and you come back from the moon and suddenly you're thrust right into the\nThe epitome of the mundane um and I just found that fascinating and it was this tremendous moment of hope that the entire world was given by the moon landing\nBut also just a reminder of the loss that it took to get there uh it didn't actually feel appropriate maybe is the word to end the movie with just nothing but cheering crowds and and people getting their pictures taken it felt that there had to be some acknowledgement in a way of um just the men's sacrifice and and a loss that will never go away\nBut without which you know we wouldn't have had this tremendous game that the whole world got to benefit from\nAnd he never went up into space again\nAnd um yeah I'm In some ways you know it's ... ... Ryan had an interesting way of of referring to when we were kind of try to figure out how to frame certain scenes in the movie and in the shooting of them\nHe would talk about how you know to him this wasn't a movie about a guy landing on the moon was a movie about a guy landed on Earth I'm added that journey to actually truly come home in every sense that word and to land on the ground and to and to be a one with your family it's a much longer journey in a way and the journey to them in\nThe film is called first man we've been speaking to that director Damien ...

what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have called for that action\nBut he said that that is not a what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take strong\nAction and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia is top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be yes so this was also in this interview the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House\nWhat did he say he did it has his position changed at all he\nSaid he doesn't think it's a hoax see a and as he famously before he became president said it was a that that he believes climate change was a hope he said he doesn't think it's a hopes that any more but he still doesn't think it's manmade or it may not be manmade and he said if the climate is changing it may change back\nHe was really pressed on this why he doesn't believe scientists or or believe some of his own scientists and he said that some scientists have political agendas and and that he's so he would have to figure out what scientists are saying this uh because he thinks that some may be politically motivated\nBy changing back presumably he means right now the climate is warming but it could stop warming at some

was just a figure of speech he says he knows that Kim as the head of an extremely oppressive regime but he argued what's important is that he has a good relationship with them\nI get along with them really well I have a good energy with him I have a good chemistry with him look at the horrible rush or a man no more threats no more threats\nSo basically he's saying that right now we're not we're not seeing nuclear test and we're not seeing um these a verbal threats against us and so that's what's important and that's happened because of his good relationship with Kim\nAlthough there's no evidence in the north stopped uh all of its nuclear weapons program\nNo and he said we don't know that nobody knows so he acknowledged that the U.S is still in the dark and some things\nAre NPR White

especially when it comes to downtown apartment but economists say actually Denver hasn't built enough apartments CPR business reporter Ben Marcus has more\nThe uptown neighborhood near downtown is the epicenter of apartment construction or just a couple of blocks more than Fifteen hundred units are under construction or just completed one is a hulking tower called radius uptown I took a tour of one of the you know ...\nEveryone's [noise]\nMajor around use just moved in herself she's a new leasing agent for the complex carrying a two bedroom\nAnd it's nice I Am ... and it's got a few coast restaurants still I was shocked to hear that such a new building is already more than Ninety percent full\nTo be fair concessions have helped\nSo right now we're offering one month a free if you sign nearly like within the month of October and then we'll throw in the ... century parking as well that's a pretty good deal actually at odds with especially down here it's hard to find parking though making sure everyone had similar to park is is they\nConcessions for apartments are up sharply jumping forty one percent over last year it's an indication of just how intense the competition is for renters to fill all the new units and there is a ton of new supply builders finished more than ten thousand apartment unit from the Denver area last year [noise]\nAnother thirty thousand are under construction this was on seventeenth street across from a popular in restaurants two bedrooms two enormous cranes are busy moving supplies into a city block sized pet this'll be another three hundred apartment homes when it's done\nHere in Denver we seem to hear at least a lot that there is a shocking amount under under construction the number of cranes in the in the in the sky but the ... the numbers don't necessarily agree\nThat's not ban some economists for CB Ari because downtown Denver is probably under built for apartments especially compared to similar cities like Seattle ... says Denver as creating lots of jobs and people are moving into the state to fill them and they tend to be young apartment dwellers\nYou know companies are continuing to to find themselves attracted to Denver and bring jobs here um we should see a healthy enough demand side to keep everything in check into into remain overall pretty healthy there's no forecast for dramatic correction\nA recent survey of national economists indicated that the recession could hit and twenty twenty but recessions are hard to protect\nGary ... in an apartment appraiser has been in the industry since the eighties so there is an unprecedented level of apartment construction right now far beyond the previous ... late nineties but the units are filling some of the highest rates you've ever seen\nMore than double our long term average and Mrs that rent levels that are at record highs for Denver\nAverage rent from the Denver area I've grown to Fifteen hundred dollars a month downtown average is two thousand a month or one of the people moving to Denver they don't have huge salaries and so actually half of Denver renters are now rent burden meaning regardless of income they spend more than thirty percent of their paycheck on housing\nStill Bruce ... thinks the apartment construction in Denver makes sense to a point\nI think that there is room to grow my concern is that we're adding so much products so quickly downtown it's been a very fast pace\nIn history suggests that recessions hit apartments hard people stopped filling units immediately vacancies spice ramps fall this could be a disaster scenario especially now because Denver developers are building tens of thousands of units\nFor now that's not a problem met brings us back to the radio uptown apartment building ... useful leasing ... she jumped at the chance to relocate here from California and she's noticed she's not alone\nSo then people getting people from Chicago or Connecticut Washington DC so alive transplants out here\nJobs and apartments or raped the region has rarely seen and as long as that last call this construction makes sense or bond markets CPR nerves now seems like an opportune time to mention Don yet in Littleton who just made a contribution and says I recently moved to Colorado\nAnd I listen on my daily commute\nAnd with as many people as are moving to Colorado these days we know that comes with all kinds of questions about\nThe future of this place about affordable housing about traffic about who leads Colorado through all of this change and growth that's a critical question as voters here elect a new governor and decide the fate of control over the state house in state Senate\nAnd incredibly important time to be connected to place and to the CPR newsroom and to give at CPR dot org one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty I'm Ryan Warner host of Colorado matters definitely will fire arts reporter is here this morning and as much as we're focusing on Colorado stuff\nWe're
