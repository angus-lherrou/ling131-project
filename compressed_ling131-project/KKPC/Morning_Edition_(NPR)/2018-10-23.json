and he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty\nThe Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles that President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same in two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only or the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons but we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the wind and the\nChances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could use just throw it\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia is developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatening\nTo change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal at it under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is\nPresident Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in\nA is really happy just to pull out\nA and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreement over multiple stench of the government is very happy to go along with that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you would prove American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think John ... is going to say today\n[noise] but I ended up going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interest because you cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and do whatever you want you guys will just have to play catch up\nUm and I think as we've seen a lot of good news more than capable not only playing catch up with a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to the arms race that were already in\nThat there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo you start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place in the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nI'm from the ministry says there's office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me but if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows up even more than it has a and we will be like we have to increase our own

that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education\nIs to really those kinds of relationships in the classroom that if given a priority with a limited amount of money they want to give it to teachers they want to support teachers they want to strengthen teachers' unions\nWhat about views of if it's not exactly public school I'm Talking about private school but also

I'm Steve Inskeep [noise]\nHundreds of thousands of protesters in London last week demanded what they call the people's vote on Brexit here's a London Mayor Sadiq Khan but at the Associated Press\nOr say is that some of the problems is ... years ago the serialized nobody was talking about ... ... nobody was talking about no deal whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete Brexit is in some political danger members of Theresa May's own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some of the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears cure ... who's the shadow breaks administer\nSome of the corps of comments about Mr this weekend attributed to conserve to send the ministers former ministers are nothing short of disgraced [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank morning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave the euro\nWhat's interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we talk it's about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know part of the EU and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was a talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of her party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language and really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom\nUm but the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a another election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain that at all or independence from you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned two went out and protest and free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWell what they were talking about there is here with here that they basically said they say you know two thousand sixteen when this post was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations are what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely that Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve and That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan that's heading for the United states\nAir dramatic picture showing about seven thousand people on the road Adam violent Hunter S and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR but he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S\nAnd if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all is because of this symbolic used being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed looking out at six he kept the caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow they said that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\n... Honduras El Salvador's invested a lot of money every year we give a far as I did nothing for us nothing\nHe's now warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid that was some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know you're safe if president through here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nWhat just make the situation worse we we should be working with these countries to try to uh to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states is the birthplace\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided about eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to ... Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nThey history the economics and he's already got completely interconnected shorts very much in the interest of the United states to see that they're all going to happen here that violence is reduced here because it's pushing people in situations irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly by if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody has to obey whoa how about the president obeying the empowerment Control Act which prohibits the president from with story or pounding buddy appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this as James Roberts of former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nWhere dozens of programs in the three countries and they the Caribbean or not all of them are effective manner you're too small to make a long term difference it's often difficult to measure gum\nWhile Roberts would liked a thorough review he points out that it takes time and needs to be coordinated with Congress he also argues that it is in us interest to help these countries blue security and economic opportunities for people in the region to keep them home\nAnd cannot begin to solve all the problems of countries they have to be from private sector ... it is a very small piece of the puzzle\nThe state department won't say whether it has received orders from the White House to cut aid officials ad that they believe Central American governments are discouraging their citizens from taking the dangerous journey north Michele ...
