often strain the thing you often hear when talking about the U.S in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is these\nAre countries that share that share interests not values\nNPR's Greg Myre we thank you thank you yesterday President Trump compared the ... case to the debate over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh said both are cases of quote guilty until proven innocent\nDuring that confirmation debate the Supreme Court justices themselves largely kept quiet now the Kavanaugh is on the court chief justice John Roberts is speaking publicly trying to make sure that the bitter fight doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinion [noise]\nBut what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be very different\nThe chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a de facto civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act within them that job obviously requires independence from the political branches the story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nBut unlike their first debate last night O'Rourke hit back\nAnd this is what you can expect over the course of this debate a center crews and not going to be honest with you it's going to make up positions and loads that I've never held or have ever take is dishonest why the president called ... and it's why the nickname stuff because it's true\nAlthough cruise would force all laugh when a war attacked him his face revealed is true emotions and the senator didn't like it but the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle it was substantive to\nCruise has the numbers on his side there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats as a result Cruz spoke mostly to his base\nThe state of Texas is booming we got right now the lowest unemployment in forty nine years Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes in low regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes\nIf cruise generally played to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power or war tended to speak to voters better angels\nWhether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now the partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of the national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nAlthough our workers running way\nOf other Texas state wide Democrats close still just you know cigar\nI think that are very good democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican senator has a chance to break through that why O'Rourke came up so strong on cruise\n... a professor of political science at Southern Methodist university\nCruising is an acquired taste people respect him as a conservative fighter they don't necessarily like game they gave Rourke a look\nBut Democrats have to recognize that competitiveness is a decade or two decades out it's not two years if not for years is longer than that because demographic change is very slow\nThat their work will appear in an hour long CNN town hall of Arab tomorrow evening and my talent on the Texas border dead grooves declined to participate so work my way up through the voters' questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing at\nThe Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering what obsesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it racist sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of get this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use of personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost to the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group\nWhat do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think\nThat a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it\nWe shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things includes race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because\nWhen we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWill tell me about ... thank you so much for talking

threatened me\nNPR in the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states we estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get this one that higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rules\nOften at twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a

let him down here and he made a comment on our site well this is America and say what I Want [laughter] and he wrote me up for it so my response that smart Adam Alex ... and I gotta a major report\nTypically when women prisoners violate rules even a lesser violation that can lose privileges like getting visits are using the phone they can go to solitary confinement or have days added to their time in prison\nNow the prison in Iowa trains officers that if it's not a security issue that some of those things go de escalate situations that we the tickets\nBecause the officer is the new ones that I've noticed they they talk to us more they interact with more to access how we doing not trying to be our friend but realized that where people are though we've made mistakes that get

year she wants to complete her degree and get a job counseling people recovering from substance abuse as states start implementing these new ways of treating women there is a small amount of research that shows women like who send the Gillum men do better when they leave prison\nSo are there lessons in this women's reform to make prison were better for men to Becky Nate thanks so women lead the way yes she's a pioneer of gender response of corrections she started the national resource center on just a symbol women\nMen probably have trauma in their lives and then probably been victimized in their lives men have lots of discipline issues\nAnd men make up Ninety three percent of people in prison\nSo maybe we will find some opportunities to take the work we know about trauma and give it a male fan and have that be very helpful to him as well\nJust like women's prisons learned from studying what specific about the trauma of women may says men's prisons can learn by studying what specific about the lives of men she says there's already an example\nMore men's prisons are trimming corrections officers how to de escalate conflict to figure out what it is about men that causes

details the first memories I have um our of me being on top of you in your bed um\nAnd that experience I was able to normalize it because I\nWant to do several words are used but you were actors in the process in the sense that you want 'em unconscious and so for\nUm that image and that memory of that portion\nOf it was what allowed me to call it such for nine years I'm when I'm going to stop Bush kind of your friends but you\nFelt was right and that I felt this was a drunk and sexual experience and I wasn't ready to have that conversation with myself as a good person I how could I possibly do that to to one of my best friend\nAgain that's audio from the HBO news program vice\nAlexis in one of her former friends James trying to reconcile a in what's called restored of justice\nBen and I both have small children you should be giving now so that ... years in the future he and I can guilt trip our kids and to give a CPR dot org is where you do that and join a woman in Westminster giving five dollars a month a woman in Englewood giving twenty dollars a month\nAnd a gentleman in Grand junction giving fifty dollars CPR dot org to make your gift on line or call it in one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty thank you\nSo much we are so grateful for your generosity\nIt's Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar could restored of justice the idea of victim an offender trying to come to a mutual understanding could it be a solution and helping those who have suffered sexual assault he'll it's the question we're asking on the show today\nAnd literally a you're a restored of justice trainer in facilitator you mentioned earlier a meeting that you've facilitated between Charlotte ... Evans who's three year old son case on was killed in a drive by shooting in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd the killer Raymond Johnson or we spoke with Charlotte ... Evans in twenty eleven again the following year after she became the first person in Colorado\nTo use the state law for a victim offender dialogue\nI gave him the opportunity to speak first\nAnd he began to disclose his whole life what led him up to the actual crime that he committed and taking my son's life and when he began to speak the first thing that came out of his mouth was\nThank you for being here thank you for this opportunity and I messed up and he began to\nWheat and he was very remorseful\nAbout the whole thing to where he was pretty much out of control as far as his remorse\nSo later in September of twenty sixteen Charlotte Evan spoke with another man convicted in the crime Paul Little John\nI just want to note there were many years between ah the murder of her son and the restored of justice process is is that important that there'll be time between the crime and the dialogue\n[noise] um it yeah that was really interesting four years later when she met with Paul that was a totally different conference she was working for something totally different the second time\nI think when I get cases are referred to me that are twelve Thirteen Seventeen years old I feel a little bit\nBetter about those than the ones that are\nLike the ... case that I just talked about the victims and when somebody has lost a loved one if they are still in the court process and they are still hit with um\nBills insurance daily it just brings a different piece than somebody who's had some time to work through some of what's happened\nAnd so you think that the process works better if some time has passed and some of the [noise] gosh I it's really the the the paperwork of death or the paperwork of being a victim has settled to some extent\nI everybody's different so I don't want to say that I think it works better but there are probably fewer things or different things to work through a period of time has passed what does it\nTake to get a an offender in a victim on the same page and even prepared for that dialogue\nSo I'm not sure if we ever get them on the same page um we are all human beings so we sort of all have a different um\nTake on the things that have happened to us in our lives but to bring them together takes anywhere I Would say from four months to a year\nOf working back and forth with each of them to figure out exactly what a victim of a serious crime is looking for and to determine whether or not the person who ... who committed the offense can give them that\nNancy Louis from the Colorado organization for a victim assistance [noise] what would it take to bring this process restored of justice to Colorado When it comes to sexual assaults ... what do you think is the promise her\nWell I think we're moving towards that I mean with this study we have probably forty forty train facilitators the it will be taking a look at\n'em once ... you know once we get sort of through this study and taking a look at it at the University of Denver University of Denver is taking a look at what is it going to take to help facilitators who understand\nThe manipulation that can happen with a sexual assault perpetrator and how do you study for that so it's very difficult you know well you you have people who have worked with a offenders and understand what that manipulation looks like\n[noise] what what do you think about the timeline a of when you engage in restored of justice is it something that you think can come fresh off a crime or do you agree that it ought to be something that follows perhaps years later\nI think every single person who is a crime victim is different and I don't think there's any way you can put a time limit on it the victim has to come to the space that day ... that's what they request and that's what they want\nAnd what you have to realize is with a very serious crime like sexual assault or losing a loved one there's so much trauma involved right away\nAnd until you get through that trauma until you've passed a little bit beyond it can you make those decisions will\nThanks to both of you for being with us we appreciate it\nThank you so much for having us\nThey Nancy Lewis executive director of

people think that financial institutions in tech companies like apple Amazon and Google have greater sway over the economy than the president's Congress or workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace tech\nHi Molly Hayes debris so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and to tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy\nDoes this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of talking big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified result snake crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female it was Republican and democratic ah the people at Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent was a majority but sixty eight percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to this sort of the mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders has pressed Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seeing policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole at the big summit in Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concerns seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so\nIt is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned nevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do better because\nFrankly that's the only thing that's going to push them

to people's cell phones\nAnd she joins us now thanks for being with us today thank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post you know in a way for me it felt like an obit for a man\nWho was passionate about free media you know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember is disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast ... and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the post\nAnd now that his columns had been translated you think that that anger at\nThe Saudi regime I think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much more powerful so as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing\nThe finger or not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia or Mohammad been someone can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\n[noise] you know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who is in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom of conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also a rested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them in like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to jail people in a five star hotel he also jailed of Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nOr many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of a Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king saw him on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question are you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince as toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist\nTo alter where Saudi Arabia is now I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will\nOn us right NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that thank you and we close today was the words of\n... in his last column for the Washington

hand\nYou have to negotiate a on the European level and the other hand you have to sell that negotiations solution down at the national level and the problem that Theresa May ... like I say this is a\nFormer prime minister is that there's a lot of good will and the continental European side to try to find a solution but it's very difficult for her to try to sell that solution back home because\nYou basically have a lot of conservative party members heart show called and the Europeans hardcore breakfast here that are uh you know like dogs are barking at her a on coal and so she is

evidence that the Turks reportedly have I can say\nThat I feel ... and um but uh I have seen no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest that show is alive or everything that I have seen 'em that's both publicly available and privately available a legal\nA belief that the Saudis ... uh unfortunately mercury show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specifics place\nOr the first thing we asked is for the president or under a piece of legislation called the Magnitsky Act or to do its own investigation and who's responsible and a sanction\nIndividuals they believed order\nA this execution and so that process is under way the president is required by law to report to us on his mind and ah but Congress can't act on its own and I would argue that we should take the step of removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries\nAre that is currently bombing of the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and the reason that I think that these she should be linked is because\nThe United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians with their bombing campaign given the fact that they are likely lying to us about what happened to show the I think that it is likely that they are also high into us some help in line to us for a long time\nAbout what they are doing inside Yemen I Believe as many others have but they are in fact\nTargeting civilians inside Yemen with the United states bombs with the United states assistance and that is the case uh than we shouldn't be any part of that coalition than it would be a I think important message to send to us that if you're not telling the truth or we're not going to be in business the\nUs in making this point about Yemen and civilian deaths there and us involvement potential involvement in Yemen for some time but you're legislation to stop the U.S support for Saudi Arabia in that war hasn't gained much traction\nWhat makes you think that this specific case of an and allegedly murdered journalist might make any kind of difference might be a tipping point\nWell I I I Will admit I Am very frustrated that oh the United states has been assisting Saudi Arabia and killing thousands of civilians inside Yemen that it hasn't gotten much attention until the\nMurder of ... this journalist inside of this conflict\nUm but I think it's getting attention now because the two are linked because we have supported Saudi Arabia is bombing campaign because we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all the suggested otherwise\nAnd so I think and I've been making the case to my colleagues for years but the Saudis aren't telling us the truth I'm there in fact on to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes are being open\nTo the prospect that Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight in the United states about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about what happened to democracy every\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia into question I experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region\nAre those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nWell this idea is that the United states has more dependent on Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous I'm ... and how is important\nWell it's important to remember that if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia we are selling Saudi Arabia\nUm it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting is that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to a military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military

from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning there were hopes for a deal to ease the departure of the United kingdom from the EU but those hopes are fading after a summit in Brussels fail to seal the deal there are no further talks on this issue expected in the coming weeks and e fish all say they are now preparing for the worst case scenario\nWe are hiring or lots of people for our customs commission off too large to work with even more vigor or a well known you'll scenario multiple experts that to happen to have to start prefer\nThat his Netherlands prime minister mark route to NPR's rice already Nelson has been following all of this from Brussels she's with us now ... good morning Noel so we should not under play at this summit there were some high expectations that this might finally seal of Brexit deal right\nYes that was definitely characterize as the make or break of whether there would be an a brags that deal a instead everybody backpedaled a and in fact ah some of the the leaders of the ... went out for beer and and French fries to sort of underscore how relaxed they were at this point and how they had no expectations anything was going to happen\nWhile that if some telegraphing fares so what went wrong exactly\nWell it's the same old issue that's been holding up this deals for for many months now and that is what happens between uh the republic of Ireland which is part of the emu and Northern Ireland which is a province in a United Kingdom\nYou know do you put a hard border there and do you not uh people are very concerned if there is a hard border there that it would threaten the peace deal so they don't want that but they just can't come to an agreement where they should put the boarder who should run that border how the customs union would work and it just they don't seem to be getting any closer on that point\nWell then you had explicitly asked Theresa May to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas that would help and all of this did she bring anything\n[noise] ah she did not um but ah what's really interesting is that there seems to be a lot of sympathy for her even though she didn't uh for example to lug simmered prime minister ... said he realizes that prime minister may is in a tough spot at least one point he realizes that\nYou know the trees on movies in a tricky situation because she saw huge Russians in Ukraine assessments us so we need to ... for the homes of charged with doing on destroying sucked into the office I'm just\nThe luck Sandberg leader says he and other an e leaders are counting on their negotiator Michelle barred gay to help break this logjam\nWell we heard the Netherlands prime minister saying his country and the European Commission or basically prepping for that march two thousand Nineteen breakfast date to arrive without a deal if that happens what would that look like\nWell it would be absolute chaos because you're talking about having to create new customs unions and knew or knew customs and border is basically you know have security people to to vet people with passports coming through\nA you're talking about way uh increased costs at various countries Germany for example is estimating more than a hundred and ten billion dollars in costs that they would incur um if if brags that were to happen in terms of increased taxes and that sort of thing\nUh so it's it's just something that nobody wants on either side of this equation\nWell how likely is that cash to happen at this point\nWell everyone is still saying that they are cautiously optimistic it won't happen that they come to a deal or possibly in December so it's something that they're going to work towards at this point the negotiators have to come back to the table and try to hammer out something that everyone can live with\nSo still a lot to be done NPR psoriasis are hiding now since ... thank you so much here welcome\nSupport comes from the show Rome at furniture oh and luxury home

parliamentary elections NATO says Miller was not injured\nThe Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack that killed powerful provincial police chief Abdul Raziq he was seen as crucial to the security of Kandahar the birthplace of the Taliban with a group continue to have a presence\nResnick was also criticized for alleged torture and running illegal prisons but his death could leave a

political story a story about us Saudi relations um golf relations I think we just decided that it was good to bring\nThat started back out and teach them all a huge amount was ... and his ideas\nWashington Post editor carrying a tea and power is returning to more communities in the Florida Panhandle devastated by hurricane Michael NPR's housing long reports a few school districts are set to reopen for classes next week\nSchool districts are preparing for students to return early next week in homes county and Franklin County which sits along Florida's northern coast\nThe classes are still cancelled in most parts of Florida's panhandle ravaged by hurricane Michael it's not clear windows schools will reopen for students um school buildings are sheltering hundreds of families across the region as the cleanup continues after the storm\nUh right now the key issue as you mentioned is is is the so called boxed up all the border issue between either are Lyndon Northern Ireland or Northern Ireland and the United kingdom and uh usually what happens in these negotiations is not a you're going to have to have a little bit of drama a little bit of theater and that's what we're going to see in the next few weeks\nCan you explain how one border could be holding up an entire treaty between twenty countries\nIt's quite simple it's because breakfast is a is a lose lose proposition a it's an oxymoron it's a paradox in many ways\nBasically what the British and just trying to say that yes we are creating a border but we're not really a on then obviously you side is saying that well Ireland is indivisible and there should be no hard border\nSo it's trying to square a circle a which is always a quite difficult but you know I've always said this is being against the you as a little bit by being us Internet you know you can do that but\nIt's much matter to influence it's content and what are you guys decided to do is to leave the European Union therefore leaving trying to\nUm which I imagine you think was the wrong idea and the first place but can you explain what that solution looks like if\nIt's coming up with some some sex to the Irish the so called Irish problem is the central sticking point what what is the solution when when Ireland or wants to be part of the EU and Northern Ireland wants to remain part of the u._k.\nWhile the that's the million dollar question I guess people trying to answer and and this\nIs a squaring of the circle that I mentioned I mean the the the solutions are being discussed is a technology a\nTechnology where and you could have a hard border that wasn't really hard that you could check goods and services perhaps but not people\nI mean you know I I think it's getting pretty old valley and if you asked me are rallying some new new speak in the sense that you're trying to claim that there's a border when there is no border or then you're trying to claim that there is no border when there is a border so it's quite complicated but this particular stage I'm afraid\nSo what is your take on that the tactics that the British prime minister Theresa May is using I mean you say this is kind of par for the course for\nAnd you negotiation but this this has been exceptional the stakes are are incredibly high do you believe that she is trying to take negotiations to the brink to force the Europeans to make concessions\nWell I I think a lot of people look a little bit much into game theory and rational choice theory when they look at the negotiations and that's a matter of fact to the end of the day it's more about social construct division trying to muddle through difficult negotiations with what we call to level game show one hand\nYou have to negotiate a on the European level and the other hand you have to sell that negotiations solution down at the national level and the problem that Theresa May ... like I say this is a\nFormer prime minister is that there's a lot of goodwill on the continental European side to try to find a solution but it's very difficult for her to try to sell that solution back home because\nYou basically have a lot of conservative party members heart show called and the Europeans hardcore breakfast here that are uh you know like dogs are barking at her a ... and so she is between a rock and a hard place and I'm just trying to find a solution I don't envy heard any which way I just wish you good luck\nTo you expected to be a deal before March when he came as supposed to delete out\nAnd to me yeah yeah you know the three ... three options yeah one is a self Brexit the other one is a hard Brexit and the third one is no deal I think ... Brexit seems to be unfortunately out of the question a self correction would basically mean that the United\nKingdom would remain close to the European Union is possible including internal markets and that's what I'm going to happen\nA hard Brexit means that they're going to be some tough choices to be taken I think that's what they're working on right now no deal or I Would argue it would be a catastrophe in any case the whole wrecks at issue as a lose lose proposition I mean you know in in the air of\nInformation technology the digital revolution a old integration the world becoming smaller to then start suddenly building walls and on and on and you know leaving the most successful\nA multi lateral Organisation the history of international relations at it just no one is going to win on that one ... and we're trying to find pragmatic solutions\nAlexander ... the former prime minister of semi talking about the latest ... negotiations um it's just you thank you so much for taking the time thank you my pleasure\nSupport for Colorado Public radio comes from Kaiser Permanente were members can get flexible care whether in person by phone or on line members can visit with a doctor and get care on their schedule more at Cape E. dot org Kaiser Permanente thrive\nSupport comes from ...

R. G.\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Rachel Martin it was impossible to ignore the ticking clock underneath the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nEveryday that went by with a day closer to the mid term elections a reality Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee are very aware of and both sides tied to leverage the hearings to their political advantage\nSo how are those hearings playing out among others NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben went to find out in Arizona where there's a tight Senate race between two women Republican Martha next Sally and Democrat ... [noise]\nTravel is super politically active\nShe's a regional director for the Arizona federation of Republican land in the end of member on the Pima County Republican women's but today he's at a restaurant in ... Arizona have lunch with another Republican winning streak\nIn their\nHand like a lot of Republican when she had a strong feeling I Love you for a decade I don't know I feel\nThat I had just put up to it and I can count on\nHer and find out who has said she believed for it is and I felt him still\nTrouble is firmly on the mic Sally and she thinks the foreign Kavanaugh hearings have amped up enthusiasm in her party\nI think it helped escalate that I think it is it on both sides [noise]\nI'm not saying one side more than the other because I'm hearing from our size [noise] how does the Republican protests we go to the holy put money down all of that\nIs one reason why Jim vote with phone banking for Democrats here and send them on one night last week to stave off any Republican surge\nWell a lot of my friends that are more progressive you guys are going to do everything they can just like the IRA\nAnd while he hasn't seen evidence of the cabinet controversy boosting turnout he has seen it into the Democrats into becoming even more engaged\nThat just made it even more [noise]\nI'm not sure if it's said okay we're going to vote but now I Am but it was definitely a vote what else can I Do Republicans may be getting more fired\nUp now but there was already plenty of democratic fury almost two years worth of it and democratic strategist Andy Barr things his party's anger has much more staying power\nPeople tend to do stuff out of anger and look at the site of more than enough of that and look back at the moment\nFor whatever anger the Democrats in Arizona might be feeling over the cabin are controversy send them on the Democratic candidate\nDoesn't sound outraged cinema has focused a lot of her rhetoric around process like the FBI investigation affords claims\nWhen I learned that we were not going to get access to the report I was very disappointed as I think many Americans were so I was forced to make a decision without being able to see that report\nForced to make a decision that's a far cry from other Democrats who have emphasized that they believe Kavanaugh had assaulted forward right now the races in a dead heat polling shows that send them a slight lead on mic Sally has narrowed in the last couple of weeks Republican strategist John Seton things cabin all played a part in that trend really what\nThink it did do is somewhat anyway galvanize cut a center right and Republican voters to come home if you will and make sure that the male their ballots both for the Republican ticket\nBut especially with the candidates and their allies sticking to other areas like immigration and health care as well as personal attacks democratic strategist bars says it's hard to say that the confirmation hearings are what narrows that gap\nThe undecided group typically more looking and they always start to come home right around you know rigor to balance\nIn a debate this week both candidates chose not to weaponize the Kavanaugh fight too much while the president has gone so far as to call for Jackie's Asians a hoax mix Sally focused her criticism on Democrats an activist not forward herself\nSeeing the mob rule in Washington DC and and the and Arizona's wanted a yes vote on justice Cavanaugh I can be for survivors is one of myself and for justice Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile moderators had to ask cinema multiple times before she'd say how she'd had voted\nWe still haven't got and that's where we would be no answer from you all the way I Would have voted no would have an hour and I did put out a statement saying

plaguing jails across the state CPR is Alison Sherry reports it started with an email\nThe letter arrived in my inbox in the late afternoon last week it had some turquoise cursive letter had that red delta county sheriff and it was signed by sheriff Fred and the key who has run that department for sixteen years and the key laid out the case of one sixty six year old severely mentally ill man who has been in his jail for weeks\nFirst off the gym and we've been dealing with him and his violent outburst for only Twenty years\nSheriff make he described how this man who he is a naming is sometimes able to stay with his aging mother that is when he's on his medications but when he goes off of them he becomes violent and threatening his family has had to take out restraining order against him and he says the man has been in this cycle for years\nEventually it ended up in our jail and getting out to another facility for a while back on medication and getting all again then we start all over in a in a month or two into the same thing\nWell the man ended up back in the jail last month and the key says he's sicker than ever in addition to violent outburst he was spreading his own feces all over the floor requiring a biohazard cleanup crew\nMickey sympathizes with the condition the manner then that says his deputies aren't trained and didn't sign up for this kind of work\nI think he's the kind of guy that under certain circumstances it very seriously injure somebody either he's a dangerous man I'm not making a future for that he is a dangerous math it gets worse under the circumstances submissions\nSheriff Nikki thinks the man should be in a secure psychiatric facility but it's been weeks and none have room to take him in this problem as much bigger than a single mentally ill man and a single rural jail\nThe state has been sued four times in the last decade for how long mentally ill people sit in jail waiting for state level services state officials say they don't have enough that space to keep up with the spiking demand and the kid knowledge there is no easy solution\nI think is going to be the ... the people that have pretty minor charges but the big issue is mental illness or in our jails and I think that's the next five to four that can be overcome or jail\nThe sheriff also points out the double standard here that people in psychiatric crises aren't handled with the urgency of a major medical problems in his letter he noted that if the end they had a heart attack he would have been in the hospital weeks ago I'm Alison Sherry CPR

org CPR dot org or one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\n... emu has the fact that this has been an open border is something that's it's promoted commerce it's ...\nIt's good relations and again it's kept the peace the issue is though if the u._k. steps out of the European Union as the plan under breaks that there has to be a border somewhere and that's where they just can't agree on I mean the Europeans have taught or the email I should say has talked about\nDoing it in the Irish Sea the u._k. is talked about maybe having some of their of agencies and and and authorities handling the customs and the and the border controls and that's something that you doesn't want so there's just a lot of disagreement over exactly how to create a hard border but they do agree it shouldn't be between Northern Ireland and Ireland\nAnd and what about her sense that there's going to be an extension is everyone on board with that\nWell this was interesting because a little later today after a Theresa May statement a Donald trust the president of the European Council a stood up and said let me just make it clear that the twenty seven other members did not want to talk about transition during a transition period or extending the transition period during the beating on brands that\nAnd the implication from from a Theresa May was more that this was a proposal that had been floated a and not just Theresa May others had sort of mentioned that this was a European proposal so there was some confusion about who is promoting that's\nA but what's clear is that Mr ... has said that they would be amenable to extending it but this is not something under consideration right now they actually need to come up with the deal\nWhereas Theresa May or they shouldn't even like to call it a transition period she calls it an implementation period says that it's an idea that's been floated that is something that could be considered if it I should say eases the debate over the board at a hard border issue with between Northern Ireland in Ireland\nI heard you say something earlier today on MORNING edition I just caught a bit of it so I don't want to paraphrase I'd like you said there was this sense that some of the other attendees at this meeting or off you know having a snack sort of sending a signal that they weren't taking things so seriously what what was going on\nWell some it had been portrayed last\nMonth by Donald took a ... in Salzburg they were having an informal ... this summit this week here in Brussels was a make or break of a deal\nFor breaks it and then this week it's like okay we don't have an agreement it's not as critical as we thought we still have time all the things that were they were saying last month was we're not the case and so\nShe waiting that was the fact that this dinner meeting at which the twenty seven members that will member states that will be remaining in the ... their leaders had a dinner meeting and then right afterwards a four of the members and this would be Germany locks and Bert Belgium in France their leaders\nWent out for French fries and beer here in Brussels to really accentuate the fact that no one seems to be that alarmed about the fact that there isn't a deal\nNow look you're based in Berlin Chancellor Angela Merkel just suffered another election set back last weekend what is her position on Brexit and how is this affecting her political strength is kind of the ripple effect of it\nShe's toned down her harshness I mean she still is adamant that there has to be a deal because the latest estimates show or that Germany could lose upwards of a hundred and ten billion dollars if brags that goes through without some sort of deal so there's a lot riding on this for\nFor Germany but she's also toned down I mean she doesn't want to make this I guess look like yet another thing that she hasn't been able to handle a so she talked instead at this uh at this summit and she did not make many public statements but the one she made was that I have a a skill at or I always look at\nA creating a consensus and finding an agreement and that's what I'm going to focus on because I still think that we can do this\nOne thing I should mention there really is a sense among the remaining twenty seven members of the other I should say twenty seven members of the a block that the u._k. is basically on purpose delaying this in order to force concessions to put put the pressure to a point where there is no time left\nAnd he will have to have of course the u._k. sees it\nThe opposite way as well

I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and being more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were say what people are where even seen our impact of on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars route\nHow 'bout that catcher not catching the first inning from the other quarter outfield pitch\nOkay you're talking about the family thing over and interfering with the possible ... Red Sox catch or what would have been an asset hung around but it was ruled interference and it costs the ask ask someone said robbed the Astros a as a possible home run what do you think of that long deliberation they finally ruled in favor the red Sox\nRight yeah oh the family in Dover did he I think it all hinges on that so to reset this it would've been into run Homer the ball\nThe ball or would have left the park but Mickey bats and fans got a little bit entangled there in right field the ball bound up on the field of play\nThere is Jose all to value the shortest player the major leagues who thought he hit a home run maybe Saudi hit a double and then was told he was out so after all those replays\nIt seems to me and and you know this isn't perfect we don't have perfect dangles but it seemed to me that perhaps fans did get their hands in the way of ... bats glove and closed ... bought where was moved the bats glove when he went off the catch\nIf he was in fact in leaning into the stands that's fine he could do that but it can't be fan interference if monkey bats glove is more over the stands part than in the field of play and Joe West\nWho is I guess let's call them the most headstrong empire in the major leagues who made that call in a post game press conference asserted that Mickey Mouse club was in the field of play not in the sense that's not how I thought OK huge huge change I Would\nSay OK fantastically interesting I like listening to ... to ... you know let's talk about the\nDodgers to or they have not won a World Series in twenty nine years they took a three two series lead over the brewers with a five to ... to win in LA last night or what are you going to be watching for in game six tomorrow\nWell I think the brewers got there on the bullpen the strength of their bullpen and it's been slightly disrupted and the other thing that happened in the game yesterday with that Clinton curve shows the best pitcher in baseball\n... has experienced a post season a Malaysian but he was on his game\nHis curve was working so the Dodgers are favorites to win there\nIt was interesting I mean the the brewers are doing all they can and they they engaged in the subterfuge of throwing out the starter weighed Miley which only the intention of pitching to one batter and then he walked into the clubhouse and he if they get their will pitch in a game six\nSo I think the Dodgers just don't have the horses to compete I'm Sorry the brewers just don't have the players to ... feet with the Dodgers and they were doing all they can without tricks and are managing to try to even things\nI Will make any difference if there'll be on their home turf\nI don't think so I think if you look at the importance of home field in baseball it's really really slightly important um the ... in the postseason fifty four percent of the time the home team wins but you compare it to the other sports you know when the NBA and the NFL sixty five percent of the time but it's really just a a slight advantage\nI just wanted to say one thing which is that I remember going to a Dodgers game and they they had a you know up on the big scoreboard it said something like last time there was a rain out at Dodger Stadium Seventeen years [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah okay do I have to ask you quickly 'cause there's so much going on in sports but this week the NBA uh LeBron James and his new Tina Los Angeles Lakers open their season tonight what should we be watching for in the NBA the season\nYeah I think that is the most important story and you don't need me to direct you to LeBron James all eyes are always on him the NBA is in a situation where it's the most interesting league and yet also seems to be the most foregone conclusion the warrior's open their season they are odds on favorite to win yet again they open their season with when I should say\nAnd you could talk to yourself into other teams possibly challenging them but I don't see a good scenario where they are and they don't deserve to be the odds on favorite well let's say let's see how LeBron gels with his teammates there in la la land\nCan tell they go on and any thoughts about the Celtics and just kind of asking any such dieting\nI say I think there's such an exciting team in Gordon Hayward who was a top free agent who got hurt and the first game of the season last year played a lot of minutes in the opener they they should be the team to the from the East that I don't know if they'll challenge but they should make the final\nOkay like asking us what analysts also

there from Marsha Blackburn campaign looking like it really wants to lash out Phil Bredesen to\nThe Democratic party and we also heard Blackburn supporters representing the fact that voters didn't at one point and vote for medicine who may not now so we talk about what his track record is um and whether or not any of this even matters his track record\nGiven the combustible politics of today\nIt does matter governor British and she is very ... everyone knows him in the state and he has always wanted to play this moderate guy right he wants to make sure he reaches across the aisle when he was a governor she worked with Republican she worked with Democrats\nAnd he always talks about that governor British and that's also been trying to avoid democratic endorsements which is very interesting so for example you said that if he were to be elected to the U.S Senate he would not be supporting democratic leadership\nSo he will not be supporting a Chuck Schumer\nAnd he's been talking about that he's been talking about how the Democratic party needs a new leadership so she's trying to appeal to the moderates appeal to toast Republicans who might be on the fence but also uh be appealing to the Democrats\nThe Democrats on the left who has been making a showing at the polls in recent elections so let's listen to one as a governor medicines adds and these are his supporters\nAnd I'm a lifelong Republican I'm a Republican I'm a Republican but I'm supporting\nA Bill Bryson 'cause he can work across the island work both parties have more with Democrats and I work with Republicans and sometimes that means he doesn't make everybody and his party happy bill was the Scully responsible\nHe worked with Republicans to bring both planes in how to hundred thousand jobs while he was governor gets things done they'll certainly different than the ... in Washington\nSo there you have an ad from governor Paterson's campaign he's a Democrat but obviously just as you said ... he's trying to get those moderate Republicans who may be feeling that Marsha Blackburn too far to the right\nThat's right and he doesn't make everyone happy like the ad says for example he recently came out things you would have voted for justice Kavanaugh something that goes against the majority of the Democrats were\nUm rallying against the justice so she is trying again to show that he is a mother that he is willing to listen to both sites and then make a decision on behalf of Tennessee and that's what he's been saying\nDuring the whole campaign but that's something that a black rent campaign and specifically Marsha Blackburn has have you know used as part of of that you know attack\nAt one of the debates up Blackburn said that she had the chance to run a Democrat he had the chance to run as a Republican or as an independent but he chose to run as a Democrat so he is part of the establishment that's what a Marsha Blackburn has tried to say during this whole campaign\nIn and trying to get the moderate Republicans away from Marsha Blackburn and doing things like can being in favor of confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court does he run the danger of putting off people who have been loyal Democrats for years\nIt it definitely affects him and he's running with this thing that he has any of the past I Need studs some of his volunteers are even leaving his campaign ... day I Can't stand why he supported Brett Kavanaugh and so that's something that it's ... it's going against him and he needs to figure it out before the election\nYou know I think ... ... the political

they're trained by those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting Paulos underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you\n\nThis this year and now from NPR WB you are I'm Jeremy hops in at a Senate Judiciary committee hearing yesterday there were no Democrats present that Senator John Kennedy Republican opened the hearing anyway\nSenator Grassley asked me to read a little statement here I'd like to briefly mention why we're holding the sharing while the Senate ... inch because ranking member Feinstein agreed to hold the sharing\nAnd with that the Republicans who were present began to review nominees to federal court judge ships the office of the senior committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein denied that she agreed to the hearing has characterized\nIn fact Democrats were so infuriated by the Republican effort to push through more confirmations that they boycotted yesterday's meeting\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here to talk about this I carry hey Jeremy so after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Senate Democrats agreed to confirmed Fifteen lower court judges before reassessing until the midterms\nBut now they say Republicans broke a promise regarding judicial nominees what's going on here\nWhat's going on here is that the Republican Party and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nHas made basically in a a bet that one of the significant and lasting accomplishments during their tenure is going to be the confirmation\nOf federal judges mostly young conservative white male federal judges to lifetime appointment on district courts and federal appeals courts around the country and these Republicans are not going to let things like the Senate recess stop them so yesterday they went ahead and held a hearing\nA for six judicial nominees even though a Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat from California the top Democrat on the committee as you noted Jeremy\nWas actually at home in California you're preparing to debate her opponent because she's running for reelection other Democrats didn't show up either in fact very few Republicans actually showed up for this hearing I so the nominees got a very very light round of questioning and moved along\nIs there anything Democrats can do to stop Republicans from doing this\n[noise] [noise] yeah they can win elections Republicans control the White House and Donald Trump has been nominating these young conservatives for the federal bench and Republicans control the Senate which has the advice and consent function here so if Democrats really want to do something\nThey're going to need to win more elections now if you talk to\nA progressive advocates and activists out there they say that Democrats could have been firmer in standing up last week and not agreeing to this deal to confirm Fifteen federal judges before they left town for the recess or there are some things on the margins that Democrats could do more of\nBut by and large the Republicans hold the power here and they're using it\nAnd just give us a sense of what we missed yesterday who got through\nYes so then the main focus of yesterday's hearing was a young woman lawyer named Allison rushing she's been nominated to serve on the federal appeals court for the fourth circuit Jeremy\nShe has only thirty six years old she's one of the youngest people we've seen in a generation or two I nominated to a federal appeals court she was a clerk for a Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and also a clerk for Neil Gorsuch now on the Supreme Court\nShe has a conservative bona few days and uh it's highly regarded in that conservative elite legal community out there\nThat that there's anything wrong with thirty six year olds 'cause I'm thirty six right now NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson thanks a lot to make you you're listening to here and

Chamber Players [noise]\n\n\nVery familiar tune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this in a lot of movies since then tell us about it [noise]\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... convenience and you have in the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand it in the late nineteenth century\n... there were arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel eons for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added\nSo this piece has been popular well before Nineteen fifty five the fun thing about the lady killers and to use and assume this is a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola\nCello was an additional challenge\nNo there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola and not with a cello somebody should have been on to this young guys are walking around without a second child is\nAbsolutely ... emu has with the fact that this has been an open border is something that's it's promoted commerce it's promoted good relations and again it's kept the peace the issue is though if the u._k.\nSteps out of the European Union as is the plan under breaks that there has to be a border somewhere and that's where they just can't agree on I mean the Europeans have taught or the email I should say has talked about\nDoing it in the Irish Sea the u._k. is talked about maybe having some of their agencies and and and authorities handling the customs and the and the border controls and that's something that you doesn't want so there's just a lot of disagreement over exactly how to create a hard border but they do agree it shouldn't be between Northern Ireland and Ireland\nAnd and what about her sense that there's going to be an extension is everyone on board with that\nWell this was interesting because a little later today after a trees I made a statement Donald ... the president of the European Council a stood up and said let me just make it clear that the twenty seven other members did not want to talk about transition during a transition period or extending the transition period during the beating on ...\nAnd the implication from from a Theresa May was more that this was a proposal that I've been floated a and not just Theresa May others had sort of mentioned that this was a European proposals there was some confusion about who is promoting that's\nA but what's clear is that Mr chose has said that they would be amenable to extending it but this is not something under consideration right now they actually need to come up with the deal\nWhereas Theresa May or they shouldn't even call it a transition period she calls it an implementation period says that it's an idea that's been floated that is something that could be considered if it I should say eases the debate over the board at the heart border issue with between Northern Ireland in Ireland\nI heard you say something earlier today on MORNING edition I just caught a bit of it so I don't want to paraphrase I'd like you said there was this sense that some of the other attendees at this meeting or off you know having a snack sort of sending a signal that they weren't taking things so seriously what what was going on\nWell some it had been portrayed last\nMonth by Donald ... a ... in Salzburg they were having a form of some of the this summit this week here in Brussels was a make or break of a deal\nFor breaks it and then this week it's like okay we don't have an agreement it's not as critical as we thought we still have time all the things that were they were saying last month was we're not the case and so she waiting that was the fact that\nThis dinner meeting at which the twenty seven members that will member states that will be remaining in the ... their leaders had a dinner meeting and then right afterwards a four of the members and this would be Germany locks and birth Belgium in France their leaders\nWent out for French fries and beer here in Brussels to really accentuate the fact that no one seems to be that alarmed about the fact that there isn't a deal\nNow look you're based in Berlin Chancellor Angela Merkel just suffered another election set back last weekend when her position on Brexit and how is this affecting her political strength is kind of the ripple effect of it\nShe's toned down her harshness I mean she still is adamant that there has to be a deal because the latest estimates show uh that Germany could lose upwards of a hundred and ten billion dollars if brags that goes through without some sort of deal so there's a lot riding on this for\nFor Germany but she's also toned down I mean she doesn't want to make this I guess lucky like yet another thing that she hasn't been able to handle a so she talked instead at this uh at the summit and she did not make many public statements but the one she made was that I have a a skill at or I always look at\nA creating a consensus in finding an agreement and that's what I'm going to focus on because I still think that we can do this\nThing I should mention there really is a sense among the remaining twenty seven members of the other I should say twenty seven members of the a block that the u._k. is basically on purpose delaying this in order to force concessions to put put the pressure to a point where there is no time left and he will have to have of course the u._k. sees it\nThe opposite way as well yeah\nThat is NPR's Berlin correspondence riots are hurting Nelson in Brussels after Brexit summit today ... thanks as always [noise]

locations\n[noise] he began doing a number of things so she started buying or building apartment complexes in Brooklyn and queens\nAnd then gradually transferring ownership of those apartment complexes to his children so for example Donald when he was Seventeen years old became co owner with his family members\nOf a fifty two unit apartment building in Brooklyn that his father had acquired for them and so they would overtime for\nTrump assembled a roughly eight apartment complexes over a thousand units and all that she transferred through a variety of mechanisms to his children and so those\nThousand units start churning out profits that flowed effortlessly into the pockets of the children and we actually documented in our reporting two hundred and Ninety five different revenue streams that Fred Trump ultimately created for Donald Trump\nOver fifty year period for Trump was so\nIngenious at finding different ways of putting money into Donald Trump's pockets or if you didn't just\nPut him on his payroll is a salary employees said he also paid them separately to be a consultant to him he paid him separately to be a property manager for him he paid him separately\nTo be a purchasing agent for him on and all that would go [laughter] he was getting laundry revenue from Trump and from the buildings so you know some of these revenue streams were relatively\nModest some of them were kind of one hit wonders but when you add it all up it was this incredible stream of money that I mean Donald Trump\nUm he was a millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old\nBefore he ever entered set foot into Manhattan\nWhere he would make his name uh for Trump it already transferred to him over nine million dollars in wealth\nHey by the time and he was twenty nine in Nineteen Seventy five Donald Trump had collected nearly nine million\nYou probably have nine million dollars in today's dollars\nFrom his father when he was thirty and I tend to have any sex the myth of Donald Trump really starts to expand their Nineteen Seventy six article in your newspaper the New York times and you describe it as one of the first major Donald Trump profiles and a cornerstone of decades of myth making about his wealth\nWhat does the article say what were the main points of the Nineteen seventies sex article that Donald Trump\n[noise] it was really one of the first big big profiles that Rahm Donald Trump and Donald Trump did something in this particular profile but if you would actually a repeat and use to great effect in subsequent profiles which was [noise]\nShe took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he called his job is empire and he starts driving around New York pointing out\nThis building in that building and talking about how wonderful they were doing and and effectively what he was doing was\nHe was appropriating his father's empire as if it were his own empire so these buildings that he's pointing out is his jobs with part of his empire there were in fact\nCompletely owned by his father had known ships taken in any of those buildings and so what he what he did especially when it was critical to kind of early mismanaging of Donald Trump was\nShe simply asserted that his father's empire was his empire and those claims unfortunately largely went unchallenged for for many years by the reporters who were kind of swept up in the glamour of this\nYoung swag lying handsome guy who was so full of confidence in so full of big plans for the city of New York and so that story\nOkay so in addition to you there's some attack schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollars on from his father and help parlay that emptiness\nIn his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nAnd we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans but one million I'm In today's dollars of ... two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw ... what is important also it was in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his borrowing another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to just read Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nThose Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch I'm sure it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then of being off to the race with\nSell it to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something to Fred Trump and that was a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nYou know and as we started out on the reporting this summer at one of the questions\nI'm immediately we knew for Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with his money I'm an every penny was you know you could see you would account for it he was a guy who would walk construction sites and if you saw a nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere\nSo we found it hard to believe that he wasn't already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers and the the the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and when we looked for um\nPossible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals are we through our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county how odd it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then bill friend it was a and basically an invoice ... operation where they were just overcharge Fred on these items that it serves no other\nWhen the Trump siblings set up all county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from French ... give it to the children did Fred Trump\nAbout the company but the purpose of the company was he a knowing part of its creation [noise]\nWe think that he absolutely was he was in the strategy meetings where they came up with these ideas\nAnd it appealed to him because it was um she was someone who just hated the idea of paying any kind of gift or a state taxes and we also see the signature on trucks um that were written to all Kelly building supplies so he was a man who\nPaid close attention to every penny is with us there's evidence built in the reporting in in the documents that she was absolutely um this was something that he was all on board with\nAnd then in a way like the collateral victims of these inflated cost were rent or isn't a lot of Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators themselves\nAs a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent controlled unit that's right when\nYou're an owner of a building and you have rent controlled apartment you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state to have the rent increased\nAnd you have to send over proof when you do that that you've made various improvements in this case they use the potted receipts in many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should have been rent increases and then the depositions that we have them that we obtained journal reporting Robert Trump Donald Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the mark up the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter Fred the parents died in June Nineteen Ninety nine at age in Ninety three\nYou say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of the tax strategies\nTo transfer money to the Trump children\nBut you're right the single largest item included infrared Trump's estate tax return was it ten point three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald Trump appear to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's debt to banks\nAnd this is the first time hearing that he owed his father millions of dollars on his father died\n[noise] well he owed his father money for most of his life um and there were repeated\nStrategies through the years to do something about those unpaid that's that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point\nDonald Trump or his father somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen million bucks and the problem is that if his father simply canceled it that\nWell in the eyes of the IRS\nOr canceled dollar of that is the same as a dollar of income so Fred trumpet simply cancelled the debt and said I forgive you you don't have to pay me back Donald Trump was owed a chunk of tax for what's called cancellation of debt\nSo Donald Trump in ... came up with this other way of making that debt completely disappear involved trading that that for a stake in one of Donald Trump's buildings\nSo Fifteen million dollars or so of that for a steak in a building called Trump Palace in them and then a few years later\nFred Trump soul that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son for ten thousand dollars proof there goes that huge debt\nMy guess or New York times reporter says and crack and

paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision\nSo the interesting thing\nAbout that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it on I think what we can never really got into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know pro Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check and then in two thousand\nThree at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSince since ... the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... Frank comments don't own at this time of his death out there last include all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of the buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire\nAnd it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through\nThe thoughts sale price was was roughly just under two hundred million dollars than what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings you made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks\nA few months before the Vegas shooting church had undergone emergency surgery fray near fatal blood clot\nThis last back was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview earlier this year in which among many other things church asserted a very mild suggestion that some sort of gun control legislation might be useful and he was immediately hit with a strong social media backlash\nSo all in all it's a difficult or at least complicated time to be Eric Church that may not be exactly what is new song desperate man is about but it might just as well\nI mean if you drink [noise]\nChurch has been making albums in two thousand and as he became more popular is recordings\nBecame more ambitious more elaborately produced and more grand the events of the past year inevitably deflated him somewhat driven him deeper inside himself and it shows in his new music\nThere's a strip down quality to many of these songs sometimes it's a matter of returning to the basics of country music in both sound and subject\nAbout one of the best song stretches ever written and recorded this one about the simple pleasures of music and a strong drink on this too called jewel box in a bar they can make cars\nDriving improved time travel and crazy yeah they'd even that um do you make so ...

shutting down\nThere are AAA or super regionals as they referred to who are booming who are receiving\nThe news of Sears demise or near demise with glee because if Sears is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back\nThese are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully talented and there are only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do with the ...\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential

his editor writes in the note accompanying the column today likely marks because she'll jeeze last piece\nWell Fred Hi it runs the Post's editorial page and when I reached tired at the newspaper today he told me what happened to ... G is a mystery but one that could be easily solved no need for a huge long investigation\nThe post to the reporters at the Washington Post have been out front on investigating this story in terms of trying to piece together what may have happened [noise] based on information available to you have to ask do you believe he is dead [noise]\nYou know we we held on to this call him that he filed the day before he entered the consulate\n[noise] uh in the hopes that we could edited with him as we normally did and um we waited and waited and I think the fact that we published today [noise] is kind of an acknowledgement to ourselves as well as to the world\nThat we don't have much hope that we're going to be able to edit this one with him or is it will ever be getting another call them from him from everything we know it seems as if you were ... of a monstrous\nCrime [noise] I'm going to ask you about the dual role that the Washington Post is playing\nHere there is of course a firewall between the newsroom and reporters an editorial page but you run a a firewall that's always there but in this case has it been tricky with post reporters trying to aggressively investigate what happened even as your editorial pages calling on the Trump Administration to do more to investigate what happened you\nKnow I don't think so I mean you know in the editorial side were often taken positions\nI Know but is it different when it's a position on one of your\nOwn you know we are all in the post newsroom dependent side and the new side I think everybody is feeling this very personally\nAnd I think we're all determined to show that you can't do this do one of ours this can't be a world where governments can lure a journalist to their own diplomatic compound in a foreign country and then if the worst is true dismembered him and have him disappear\nYou just spoke there about feeling this personally um how has his disappearance affected your team and affected you\nKnow it's it's very painful or first of all he was well loved by many people [noise] you know if this could happen to gym all it can happen to any journalist and pets to my mind not the kind of world any of us want to live in\nAs many things that struck me about his last column that you published today one is that he thinks the post for publishing his work not only in English but in Arabic to reach obviously an Arabic speaking in reading audience and I want to ask how common practice that is and why you chose to do that in his case\nBecause we see our mission as I'm presenting a range of opinions\nAcross a wide ideological diverse landscape especially in countries where people can't get it from their own media and Jamal was you know the reason he left Saudi Arabia\nWas she felt she could no longer do it at home and that a lot of people who want it to express themselves in Saudi Arabia were muzzled aren't prison and so he was willing to take some risks to do what they couldn't do\nAnd uh if we can do it in their own language as well as an English all the better he\nWrites in this last column about ah the regime in Saudi Arabia clamping down on on the Internet or do you have any way of tracking how widely read his columns have been either an English or Arabic in his home country in Saudi Arabia\nSo we have certainly seen when we translate our editorial or ... or other pieces into Arabic when you get a big spike in readership from the region [noise] one of the most heartbreaking things about this is that he was a patriot he supported a lot of the reforms that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia says he's four\nBut he believed that the best way to accomplish them was to allow people to debate them and uh to express opinions and I'm In the long run that's the way his country was going to succeed\nAnd I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nFred Hi it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post and a colleague of ... thank you thank you\nYears there's been a debate about what to do with the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens to sit across the street from President\nWashington hotel a newly released batch of emails

as a headquarters of a federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI side but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon that's occurred hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail here is in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finish as more\nAnd last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere this spring GST administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild\nThe the destruction that we got came from the FBI it was the FBI to drink and she has asked what's requirements of gig but the emails released\nToday suggest something else one G is a official referred to the project as quote a demolition new construction Persia presidents instructions\nAnother referred to it as quote what ... directed everyone to do jury ... a democratic congressman from just across the Potomac in Virginia he said that redevelopment could land a competitor across the street from Trump's hotel\nA number of us thought the president had to have something to do with this personally\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the New York times that quote the president wanted to save the government money and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters Kathleen Clark is a law professor at Washington University of St Louis her specialties governmental ethics\nThis is a problem because Trump's intervention may well have been motivated by his personal financial concerns with his own hotel\nBut he points out the president is exempt from federal ethics laws including the ban on conflict of interest\nAdjust a spokeswoman said the emails were taken out of context and referred to funding issues not to location\nAt this point in time Republicans will get all the negatives that are associated with the president we sure as heck

doing to gain an edge in this final stretch before the mid term tomorrow Hi there Hi so start with the issues there's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks of the the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border of crisis with Saudi Arabia\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field\nThey are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all the house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three\nPick up seats that they need which they said they need Senate map looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of\nSenate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular we know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout mid term election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries and special election in\nWhich the closing argument that both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people and I'm looking at a fundraising pitch\nFrom Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care\nWhich is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich created a huge deficit and to close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security\n[noise] may I ask you the flip side of a closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than\nRepublicans are worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought oh Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland\nA Trump and another problem for Republicans is the Trump kept telling his supporters there is a red wave and the borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually loses\nThe president is under fifty percent Democrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nAh right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party shifting to the left nationally\nDemocrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIs deep red and according to a recent poll a Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat and McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator notes that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman\nWho got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly what I'm working when I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love as aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd was she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries\nDuring the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that it stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there she is this the turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington when I see\nIs if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams that many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "18"}
