because I didn't quite trust of the reader to get it ...\nYou know those two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is I Know that's true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs cannot actually be what's important to whether a marriage lives or dies [noise]\nI have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter and and I can tell you that by analogy [noise]\nSo what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book\nIs that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when you can actually understand for the first time in your life or your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person it's as if you shed everything that happened before\nRight I mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person that doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt does and it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage it's about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be and that's why it takes time because it's\nIt is not some kind of blinding insight that you're going to have oh God just happened to be and I was fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all it's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't habits together they weren't didn't have a great marriage\nIt's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what a couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage cancer leaves them through for example throughout the book to show stopping to say I want you to look at each other and told me what you see\nAnd as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they're really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way\n[noise] I said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you write Dutch writer really a sort of a fourth character there is which is the marriage itself it's the marriage itself\nAnd the marriage cuts are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character she's actually listening to the marriage as the marriage changes in the office\nAnd she's trying to get the couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriages as something that they built over time that's very important and its allies underway this different from each of the\nMarriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of adults are married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties or your family has clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters\nWell I mean you're absolutely right in my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of\nTransnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro an important relationship because it makes your life so much better you know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like\nThe two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you literally become more than the two of you if you can if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together\nDo you think every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years [noise] but I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay I\nMean it's it's the critical thing in your life you want to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can feel and talk to and that gives it back to you

Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan more Colorado's new law cracking down on prescription opioids could have unintended consequences some doctors worry that people in legitimate pain won't get the medications they need\nMatthew ... is medical ethicist and director of the center for bio ethics and humanities at the University of Colorado and shoots medical campus and we'll come back to the program nice to be here thanks for having the law we're talking about which just recently went into effect\nLimits opioid prescriptions to a seven day supply in most cases than it would have to be renewed by a doctor and I'll say there are exceptions for people in hospice care or those with chronic pain or who have some serious illnesses like cancer but\nWhat is your fear in in what is that fear based on\nI think the concern here is that um there will be physicians and nurse practitioners and others who make these prescriptions who will be a so concerned with\nA breaking the law and I'm putting that kind of scared quotes because these are more guidelines than they are laws on that there will be people who are so concerned with breaking the law that they will become overly cautious in um prescribing pain medication to people who legitimately need the pain medicine\nAnd we are starting all ready to see examples of this nationwide where patients who need pain for legitimate purpose of pain medication\nFor legitimate purposes are finding it difficult either to find a doctor who's willing to write the prescription\nOr sometimes even to find a pharmacy willing to fill the prescriptions there's a lot of second guessing going on it's raising issues of stigma and discrimination I'm and I think that's the that's the concern is that there's sort of a backlash\nUm which is a backlash to a very real problem you know you know I don't want to under play the importance of the crisis that we face in terms of opioid addictions and overdoses in death there's a lot\nThat I Want to follow up on in that so first off are you seeing concrete examples in Colorado of patients who legitimately need pain medication and are not getting it so\nI'm not aware of a study about that NATO far but there are many um individual examples of people complaining\nThat you know they have had to visit two or three or four ah clinics before they find someone who is willing to write the prescription\nThere are certainly anecdotal examples of clinicians who have basically said\nBecause it has become such a hassle and so difficult and potentially risky for me to write these prescriptions that I'm just not gonna do pain management anymore [noise] um and that's that's where you know you really worry about the access to care\nFor patients who have legitimate pain and need access to the to a ... well not only to opioids but ... other management services for pain as well\nDo you think that this is perhaps shutting the door and not just to opioids but to like a broader conversation with someone doctor about pain in general that's interesting\nI I I have a concern and again I don't have data on this but I have a concern that because people have become so reluctant to prescribe opioids 'em and because it's been difficult to get alternatives services covered there are physicians and others who are just saying I'm not going to deal with chronic pain at all anymore\nWhat do you mean it's been difficult to get some alternatives covered so if if if perhaps I'm a a patient or a doctor interested in something other than opioids for pain management or you were saying it's hard to get insurance coverage for things like that and what would that include\nYet sometimes has been difficult to get insurance to cover things even including things like physical therapy but many of the alternatives to opioids or the abuse deterrent opioids which are more expensive\nUm have been ... there have been barriers put up in terms of getting coverage to those you have to go through some paperwork in order to get those kinds of things covered or you have to try something else first those types of things it's\nA bit of a catch twenty two year describing are there a particular conditions or particular populations among patients you're concerned about in terms of legitimate access to these pain medications\nSure so I'll just give maybe the most obvious example which is someone with non cancer\nChronic pain and so you could put in that category people who have for example sickle cell disease so there about a hundred thousand people in the country who have sickle cell disease they typically\nThe experience very severe pain and for many years it's been difficult for them to access adequate a pain control and the opioid crisis has exacerbated that for those patients even though by the way they're relatively unlikely to overdose on opioids\nI think of as sickle cell as disproportionately affecting the African American community and so that speaks to the sort of this proportionality\nIt does and it raises the other piece of this that I find fascinating as an ethicist um about this that\nWhen you have a condition where the only way to ascertain the presence or absence of that condition is by talking to the patient and trusting the ... yes so we don't have a blood test or or any other way to us ascertain the level of someone's paying\nThat makes communication very important\nAnd of course anything that relies on communication is also more susceptible to bias it's more susceptible to miscommunication and misunderstanding into lack of trust and so on\nInteresting and so if there's any racial bias perhaps a that is affecting a physician's decision making or perception of a patient that could have real consequences for say an African American patient walking into a doctor's office right and\nOf course on an individual level um it's it's pretty uncommon to find a a clinician who was overtly bias in terms of race but we also know that implicitly people tend to have um you know\nStereotypes that that unfortunately come into play in all of our human to human interactions and they're particularly at risk when you're dealing with something where communication is really at the core of the entire interaction\nIt strikes me that fundamental to this is teaching a health care professionals as much as you can to differentiate between people who are legitimately in pain and trying to communicate that to you versus someone who is essentially trying to do you\nAh is is that a skill that that doctors are taught easy is it even a skill that can be taught\nAs a great question um it is something we try to teach a I don't know that there are you know great studies that prove that it is teachable because in the end um this is a human to human interaction and whether someone is trying to dupe you or whether they're telling you the truth\nThere was this one guy in particular who seemed to have put a lot of thought into it was real quick you introduce yourself me what's your name\nSure Joshua Adam I live in Denver, Colorado\nAnd I asked him to the same question I'd ask everyone else so when you get your butt out this week and you go to a job in the mail and drop it off how confident and you feel um that it's going to be counted correctly [noise]\nUm [noise] from\nThe things on which I've recently happened that have been in the ...\nNews ... news the federal government has revealed that hackers targeted election systems in Twenty one states last things\nThat I've read on and seen on social media it's alarming and concerning because I mean with so many different systems that I've played with our ... our balance that scare you know\nWhen I asked him for more specifics he said he is most worried about Russian and how he thinks they've been messing with our election\nDo we really have a voice or are we yelling in a hole or hit and somebody else is actually the one pulling the strings in the background [noise]\nIs he right to be concerned that a foreign government could hack the election [noise]\nI mean we can't say no because they tried to years ago Russian hackers attacked state election systems including ours in Colorado it didn't work as far as we know but Adam stop that Russians had done that had actually change the vote tallies the last election\nFrom the things that they have found they mess with the election right so if the people in Russia can do it why can't the people here do it [noise] [noise]\nWhat we do know about this when he's sixteen election from the Mueller investigation and other work\nIs that the Russian government was trying to influence how people do things like fake news website propaganda\nBut as far as we know they didn't actually change any votes right but Adams isn't alone in thinking that they did a recent NPR poll found that one in three Americans believe it's likely a foreign country will change vote tallies in the upcoming election like one in three American and that's not good because if people think\nTheir votes won't town this whole system of democracy of self governance crumbles people might not show up to the polls they might not see their elected leaders as legitimate\nDemocracy really depends on people trusting election results it's clear that even in a state like Colorado where we supposedly have this really good election security system voters here are skeptical to\nThis week on purplish we're going to look at how Colorado gained its reputation for being the most reliable state to cast a ballot and why in twenty Eighteen that expert opinion might not be enough to put Colorado voters\nOkay but they didn't mind it let's do it how to Colorado get so good at election security I think to really understand it you have to go back to two thousand\n[noise] an election in ... president see in the ballot and they shouldn't wait [noise]\nWho will emerge in the story Florida recount\nMisses the moment where people in America start to doubt this technology that defined our elections for so long paper ballots\n[noise] the Florida recount showed all the just embarrassing problems that can come along with the traditional punch card system\nFirst you have to know that the control is called lake Chad\nSo you've heard about all this chats right yeah like the hanging chads I I was only ten when this all went down but I mean it was everywhere\nYeah I was twelve a but the chats that showed paper ballots are not foolproof right\nThat involves chat there is an invitation and the ... the voter put some pressure on it but didn't catch it at all from the valley that was right on\nYou know certain designs can leave a lot of room for human error\nThe final category ... chats that is a chat with terrorists with them\nAnd then in Palm Beach County Florida that the whole design of the ballot was problematic\nDemocrats in charge of confusing ballot lay out let voters to things they were punching the ballot for Al Gore when they were actually voting for reform party candidate type you can in three five hundred people did not\nOn is heavily democratic county\nThe Supreme Court eventually ended the recount and declared George Bush the winter but the turmoil in Florida led to this bill called the help America vote act harbor and it was designed in large part to phase out old voting\nMachine when I first vote in Connecticut the equipment I use to vote then as they come and I've used today and that's true and so many different states to improve that\nAs a result of ... six hundred and fifty million was provided to the states to replace lover and punch card machines for more modern voting equipment\nBasically the federal government had a plan to make voting systems more modern and accessible and the guidelines they spelled out led many places to purchase electronic voting machines and why like what were the advantages to those devices\nSo the interfaces were clear in some cases more straightforward that paper ballots and many of them were more accommodating of people with disabilities and then also you don't have piles of paper to sort through and count\nBut around the country and in Colorado people started to worry about these things\nWho like who is raising the objections to these voting machines in Colorado so what are the most\nPersistent activist was this guy I'm Neil Mick burn it I'm an independent consultant I went up to Boulder recently to meet Mick burn it uses how guy with the big bushy red beer and just a sweet nice guy and he sort of like equal parts tech whiz and as believer in democracy\nDemocracy is hugely important and recognizing that threats long before anyone was talking about Russia or cyber attacks has been a big motivator for me\nAnd he had an opportunity to get involved back in two thousand and two\nI a friend called me up and said hey they need election judges and I said that sounds fun like to know more about the mechanics of the process\nLike an election judge so he's one of those people that oversee everything at a polling station and then they're often the ones who give you that my\nI voted right and in two thousand to Boulder County still had paper ballots but as a computer scientist Mick burn it did not like they're system\nI was nervous because they were using computers to count and report our votes and I saw no one's paying attention to the paper ballot that people had marked their choices on\nWhat ... is is that Boulder wasn't doing anything to keep track of its paper ballots that gets fed them into a computer\nAnd then paid attention to the final vote counts I mean what's wrong with that the results are what matters here right I'm not really\nBecause let's say someone did manage to hack in and change results how'd you know like if you had the original paper ballots kept under lock and key and carefully kept track of them you could use that to track against those results\nIt's critical to have paper involved in elections in order to allow us to look at the evidence for each individual election and see if the evidence the paper ballots actually matches what a computer's produce as the outcome of the election\nSo in other counties we're moving toward electronic voting systems may burn it and others convince bowler to stick with paper\nAnd the previous clerk looked like she was on a path where she wanted to use more electronic equipment\nThis is Hillary hall the Boulder County clerk and record her she credits people like me burn it for preventing that from happening\nAre citizens really engaged our commissioners and through that we ended up with a model where everyone would vote on a mail ballot unless you want it to use the accessible equipment in most people cast their ballot on paper\nOkay so in places across the country that aren't Boulder counties or sometimes are moving more towards electronic voting systems right but this backlash gross and then eventually gets into a Halloween episode of the Simpson\nWhen it does a lick dramatic voting the homers using a touch screen and it's not working one vote for McCain thank you you know what you want to vote for Obama votes for McCain\nCome on it's time for change three vote for McCain no I don't know six votes for President McCain\nAnd it's been a Halloween episode homers actually eaten by voting machines\nMaybe Ohio\nBut anyway the point is that these new machines\nWere becoming a joke in their own right okay so people started to read doubts about these machines and whether they were accurate and safe and it would work what happens in Colorado once\nThat movement gross so the counties across if they started picking notice and move\nToward neighbor themselves in adult combination twenty Thirteen\nWhen the state legislature passes a bill moving Colorado to all male and paper ballot and part of that was to increase access but it also meant that almost every vote in the state now was kept on paper the one exception is overseas voters in for Neal mid burn it after years of pushing this was like a sweet sweet victory\nBut yeah I was absolutely thrilled it's exciting when something that you've cared about for so long starts coming to fruition it always takes longer than you think I have\nTo say that [noise]\nWhen we come back Sam follows a ballad from kitchen table the tabulation where's the voting system most vulnerable leases Colorado matters from CPR news [noise]\n\nThere is going to be a change in the weather's starting tomorrow mostly along the front range as well as in the central mountain\nMeanwhile tonight look for partly cloudy skies or increasing clouds with Lowes for Denver and Colorado Springs around forty this is CPR News Denver can expect rain or snow showers tomorrow turning much colder\nThat she spent it on so called ... Chu I think my grandma calls them or not she she's a voter in Ohio I mean it may mighty as just nowhere um so it really isn't an issue for him\nBut I kind of answer your question or a something kind of strange happened um a few weeks ago uh Germany she began incorporating into his campaign messaging elements of a shirt Brown's Nineteen eighty six divorce there were allegations of\nA kind of in the vein of domestic violence by\nUm his wife since this kind of insane you waited that maybe she exaggerated and she is a big campaign supporter now and Republicans in the past have campaigned on that issue although with some trepidation but it's a centrally became one of the main features of ... campaign so\nKind of a combination of him being down ten Fifteen points in public points and then going really hard on this kind of issue that Republicans have been kind of a a reluctant to address head on his has led to a very personally nasty race and you know you see Sherrod Brown kind of almost you know I'm kind of\nGetting into his mind but I think it's kind of relishing kind of a you know insulting weren't ac during the debates have been happening here and stuff like that so it's just like I said I mean the\nUm the numbers in the race don't really support the idea that competitive but it's become very contentious\nA contentious but but not competitive\nThat's I again I mean I think that the the big thing there is that a Gemini and she has spent about five hundred thousand dollars on campaign ads during the general election and you know\nA shared brown heads that somewhere in the ballpark of at six Fifteen million dollars so I mean I don't know what the ratio is off the top of my head twenty to one twenty five to one but a gymnasium calling it just shows a lot of Iowans don't know who gets jerked around in an office years since the late Nineteen seventies and he's he's one of the best known politicians in the state so it's just really\nUh you know there's some political factors that are Republicans should do well here but it's this kind of never really gotten there hasn't been even fights\nOr is there a couple of competitive house races that I'm going to try to get to the fore\nFor benefits that we have left um there is the first and the ... district there's in the first Congressman Steve I'm\nSince I mispronounce the name of it happened I was about to say ... new in good he's approved possibly because of his uh the the cabinet bump a what's go who's his opponent in that race\nSo ... is the name of the guy running against Shadid or he is the Hamilton County a quirk of course I think I'm blanking just off the top of my head but use the county level official in business in Cincinnati and\nThe young guy he has an interesting kind of immigration story and his background and he's run a very energetic race but I think that adds some of the Republican groups recognize what was happening there they've been able to deploy a lot of money and it seems that ... ah his his numbers have stabilized ...\nYou know looks like he's in decent there should be elected at this point but you never know\nAnd in the ... district is congressman or Troy Balderson a who won a special election against Danny O'Connor in August to fill the seat and he has now but he has to run against O'Connor a second time to hold the seaport full term\nRight and then since we don't a lot of time I'm not going to blame the mechanics of it but it involves retiring congressman seriously held that seat but something interesting that happened there um\nYou know it's a very close race in August is less than one percentage point in a district that Trump won by\nAround ten points and twenty sixteen um and\nUh but O'Connor had maintained a pretty large cash advantage since then voters than was kinda bailed out the last minute then kind of some of the national Republican groups in the opportunity that Democrats winning in Republican districts would kinda be demoralizing so they kind of deployed a bunch of money to help the owners and help them get the top well\nA O'Connor continues to have the cash advantage in that race boulders and continues to be a weak campaign fundraiser and so a pro Donald Trump superPAC actually sent a million dollars so that race just last week to help out ... and so that's assigned to me that Republicans see\nA Democrat opportunity to pick up that seat still remains alive it's has a lot of the suburbs of Columbus and it's kind of characteristic as was districts that Donald Trump's and weak in other areas of the country so I I look at that as as probably the best chance for an upset in Ohio\nAnd into two minutes that will actually meant and half that we have left you a ballot issue ballot issue one what is this about\nI mentioned it earlier um it's a constitutional amendment that would basically be classify a lot of drugs young a ... charges as misdemeanors from felonies would actually reduce by twenty I think by twenty five percent the sentences of people who are currently serving a sentence is on those types of crimes I mean it's it has some different factors to it um\nAnd ah you see it's very well funded and I think it's kind of tension under the radar factor where they had to get out the vote effort it's hard to know exactly who they're targeting says it's not really traditional political\nIssue right um you do see an opposition um Republicans actually are basically running against it including like the wind you see a lot of judges coming out against a county prosecutors they say that will make Ohio struggle was last week that it will um take away options for prosecutors and judges so it's it's kind of something in the background here\nOr Andrew Tobias political reporter

week's midterms he calls it an invasion\nThey'd rather than a stray chin is asking the U.S Supreme Court to postpone the first trial over the citizenship question added to the twenty twenty cents as NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports that dozens of states cities and other groups are suing to get the controversial question removed\nThe emergency request to the Supreme Court comes less than a week before the first citizenship question trial is set to begin on November fifth in New York City it showed them initiation is asking for more time so that the Supreme Court can review its new request it was the justices to block lower court orders allowing testimony of two senior Trump officials to be considered in the case it's\nThat's exactly what you're doing then I think it's natural to expect that a few people within this movement are going to begin behaving as if they're at war and they're going to take drastic action and the sort of fear mongering that happens I think particularly around immigration in the country is\nA big huge fuel behind white nationalist ideas and it's it's something that comes from mainstream corners of our of our country in politics and on the Internet and I think one of the scary things about it the the last post the hours right on gab is if you take out the last sentence the I'm going in that reads essentially\nLike many means on Facebook or do every day it reads like hundreds of posts on storm front do every day these are widely held ideas\nAt white nationalist recently have gone from referring to immigrants first is illegals which is insulting enough then as infiltrators and now as invaders and they speak about this as if they are wartime commanders which begins to justify drastic and violent action\nA President Trump has been calling himself a nationalist and some people are saying that's a really must work for white nationalists and that's\n... is like one step away from calling yourself a white nationalist and so I'm I'm Wondering how your hearing the president's self description as a nationalist and also how that is being heard in the white nationalist world\nYeah I think that a white nationalist feel like\nDonald Trump in some ways has been sort of winking at them and has been for\n... years now and in ways where he can use some of their language but also managed to explain that he was not saying it exactly that way so you know during the presidential campaign that sometimes meant that Donald Trump would retweet a white genocide message from from the white genocide user and that exact\nPhrase white genocide would be spread dolls Donald Trump's followers I think similarly\nWhen Donald Trump sort of said that he was on a nationalist and give it the defense for national is I'm a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is missing link to us that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies as some of what we're doing even though of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nThe synagogue shooter rubber ... hours criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are said he's not a nationalist he's a globalized globalized a buzz word for Jewish\nYes the globe with is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish and above worried that\nThe president himself and and many people close to him have used often the final campaign ad of of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global west with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um\nYou know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if\nI'm Jews are this is sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over\nThe u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence\nAnd I'm Wondering here if it's confusing to white nationalists to feel on the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national that's been on the other hand his son in law Jared is Jewish\nUh ... daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get a sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but it's the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration am white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is\nDoing this dance of empowering some of their ideas\nSpeaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough\nRoom to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement and so I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology\nBut they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform that powers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about\nThat that gap is pretty small and and the social media space than that I think it's about a half million users um but uh it really embraces this sort of radical idea of\nFree speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't doesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gas Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there and there's a very high representation of\nWhite nationalist racist ideas on gab you know I think the danger of a place like\nGab and also the danger of of other social media network is that it allows for people who already have these ideas\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he\nFollowed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the\nWhite nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue I'm In store front is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on a message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh\nYou know several mass shootings connected back to people you've spent time on store front over over the last decade and\nAnd the reaction is mostly that's well that's probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter and stuff\nBut our our global health and ah choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get\nFrustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging the heat it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating a phrase white genocide and said to popular I think the movement to then have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked sass lowest the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break\nThis is fresh air you know\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nMm\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert powers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday\nEcho the views of the white nationalist movement we've got to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could holding their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worse than don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I did not do you feel like that for ... your plans for like I take over the Republican Party\nIt foiled my plans for um being on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organize a campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the point was always the show that that could still work in the in the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that boggled bomb a winning was a sign that why people would start voting more strongly on a racist ideas not less\nYou know I put that into context for us with their lives Derek like the only person men who ... who is thinking that thought that with Obama running for president and then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election is a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist have done a with with dangerous effect is\nPlayed to this ah factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that thirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experienced more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or than juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away ah things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish\nThat has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters and and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has it gotten other politicians elected in our country is well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue exactly right it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride then or\nWhat you see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts that were attended by majority white crowds in the south or in Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out these CDs so to suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was rebranded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races\nThere are other ways that white white nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would\nOrganize little teams that are apparently on line it's wads that would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and would talk about white pride talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white and\nSpecialist said [noise] I find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy and yet there you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors\nAre and who the victims and who they are exactly in the ... and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section\nAnd the white unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nTo being attacked ... it's not like all\nThe immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme that it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white miss and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had because society was trying to\nUndermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy and and for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races in two different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how to are we going to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white ends and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to us do who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post's

floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team\nAnd we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this until now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in drafting\nAn order like this as just a left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over a there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of paper where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits uh the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\nWell that's right and we're talking about all that sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a a nascent\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of of having children we should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nPetition that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try scooter\n[laughter] he may try it and this certainly face a a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this has catnip to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley [noise] both\nServices to the victims of the mass

we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come in and guards them and be with them while they're there they pray they say songs and so it's just somebody should pass from this world by themselves it ... it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says that ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's what we call the great it's a great commandment to great good thing that we do it's very difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a day

from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in the Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect wasn't active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gain traction either will there haven't been so what's a good example of how this were a sure so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off this sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and sort of mainstream politics absolutely\nPeople don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the mean an up and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even though I Know yeah\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact who rains as soon as the job of of the press than not these things down should fall the social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press tries to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and ... even before that a but it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it ethics rather\nPolitical odds makers identified dozens of congressional districts that are in play as it said could go either way\nAnd will determine which party wins the house this fall one of those seats is the second district of Maine it's voters supported President Trump in two thousand sixteen but supported President Obama just four years before that let's travel there with NPR's Brian Naylor\nThe second district of Maine stretches across a vast swaths of the state was deeply wooded forests and small fishing villages\nMostly rural it's not just the main of lobsters and light houses but more hard Scrabble was shuttered mills and one of the worst opioid problems in the nation\nDemocrats think it could swing blue again one afternoon last week their candidate Jared Golden greeted workers at the afternoon shift change at the verse so paper mill in Jay\nGolden is a thirty six year old former marine\nWho signed up after nine eleven and served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in an interview at a nearby hospital golden said his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the SEA and very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk when voted for that though\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical Goldman led government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still blink taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and all these dark money groups\nThat are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a and attacked me and say I'm somebody and I'm not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for ... for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in a tweet refused to state whether she voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody ...\nI asked golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't\nView my role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something hurts Maine I'm gonna I'm gonna stick up for our state\nAccording to the center for Responsive Politics the two major candidates and parties and political action committee supporting them have\nDropped over eight million dollars into the district to independence in the race or not expected to be a factor but could be because of a wild card may now has ranked choice voting in federal elections mark brewer is a political science professor at the University of Maine\nIf you were to go and get your ballots um today and boat you would be you'd be given the option to rank those four candidates one through four one being your top choice in for being your last choice\nIs a new candidate receives the majority the last place finisher is eliminated their votes would then go to whomever the eliminated candidates voters ranked as their second choice no one knows for certain how this will play out in public when has refused to say whether he'll honor the results should he loops\nBrian Naylor NPR News Lewiston, Maine [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nThis is CPR news and of course we're getting a lot of politics on this morning It's MORNING edition just a week now before election day\nAnd you can catch up on what's going on in Colorado at CPR dot org you can listen to our podcast called ...\nAll about Colorado is you know purple politics and there's the road trip to November with reporters going all over the states and I mean all over the San Luis valley and the far north east corner of Colorado\nAnd coal country in the western part of the state and all around the Denver area and we are hearing from report from the voters and people all over the state or reporters have been\nComing back with a lot of great pictures and you can see all of that in the road trip to November that CPR dot org and there's our voters guide if you want some help filling out the ballots all of that CPR dot org\nAnd thank you for listening this morning to MORNING EDITION your own CPR news\nAll anymore what do you mean it's been difficult to get some alternatives covered so if perhaps I'm a a patient or a doctor interested in something other than opioids for pain management or you were saying it's hard to get insurance coverage for things like that and what would that include\nYet sometimes has been difficult to get insurance to cover things even including things like physical therapy but many of the alternatives to opioids or the abuse deterrent opioids which are more expensive\nThere have been barriers put up in terms of getting coverage to those you have to go through some paperwork in order to get those kinds of things covered or you have to try something else first those types of things it's\nA bit of a catch twenty two year describing are their particular conditions or particular populations among patients you're concerned about in terms of legitimate access to these pain medications sure\nSo I'll just give maybe the most obvious example which is someone with non cancer\nChronic pain and so you could put in that category people who have for example sickle cell disease\nSo there about a hundred thousand people in the country who have sickle cell disease they typically experience very severe pain\nAnd for many years it's been difficult for them to access adequate a pain control and the opioid crisis has exacerbated that for those patients even though by the way they're relatively unlikely to overdose on opioids\nI think of as sickle cell as disproportionately affecting the African American community and so that speaks to the sort of this proportionality\nIt does and it raises the other piece of this that I find fascinating as an ethicist about this that\nWhen you have a condition where the only way to ascertain the presence or absence of that condition is by talking to the patients and trusting the patient yes so we don't have a blood test or any other way to us or ascertain the level of someone's pain\nThat makes communication very important and of course anything that relies on communication is also more susceptible to bias it's more susceptible to miscommunication and misunderstanding until lack of trust and so on\nIt strikes me that fundamental to this is teaching healthcare professionals to differentiate between people who are legitimately in pain and trying to communicate that to you versus someone who is essentially trying to do view is that his skills that doctors are taught is it even a skill that can be taught\nIt is something we try to teach I don't know that it is teachable because this is a human to human interaction and whether someone is trying to dupe you or whether they're telling you the truth and by the way we worry a lot about training people to question\nThe truthfulness of the patients that they're serving right I mean we we spent\nForty years the last forty years really trying to get over\nPhysicians being highly paternalistic [noise] I'm thinking that they always know best and trying to get people to trust\nThat the patient brings expertise to the table and the decisions need to be made in a shared way and basically to trust the patient and now we have an opioid crisis\nAnd so in this one domain we are telling doctor's weight you know that old paternal ism stuff that we said was so bad in this instance it's not so bad we want you to second guess what patients think they want and tell them you know instead what you think is best for them\nI have a real medical ethics questions for you\nGiven watch the opioid epidemic has rocks on our communities the pain that has has wrought on that and some amount of pain among patients who legitimately need the drug is that a fair exchange for the larger benefit to society\nThat's a painful question in of itself to ask but it strikes me is that kind of philosophical questions map you any of that you grapple\nWith that is the question really at the heart of policy around this right 'cause policy looks at what is good on average community on average for community there may be some trade off that we are willing to make\nThat some number of people will find it a little harder to get access to opioids that they really need\nAnd in exchange we are avoiding some of the you know one thousand deaths last year from overdoses in Colorado and of course what we'd like to say is that we never have to make that tradeoff so there are a lot of ways that we try and mitigate the potential risk of having opioids in the community but it\nSounds like this debate is ongoing ... how much individual pain of society is willing to accept for that broader scale reduction in harm thanks for having me understand my pleasure Matthew winning a medical assistant director of the center for bioethics and humanities at the University of Colorado and shoots medical\nCampus and we talked about the crackdown on prescribing opioids and how it relates to those who legitimately need the drugs for pain I'm Ryan Warner CPR

in bed anytime between like ten thirty and wine\nAt five AM for pages off to work at the restaurant she leaves Alex a list of chores there honeydew list he walks in the door around seven AM and it gets to work on it\nThe honey do list and then once I get through all that it's just time to wind down I mean watch a little TV mess around my phone come right around noon one o'clock it's time for

Bernie Sanders last time Alix went for Donald Trump\nHe is always lean conservative partly because of his face he's been a foster child homeless he fought a heroin addiction and in a way of religion found him\nI didn't really believe in it too much up until the sixth or seventh foster home ended up in one of my foster brothers actually stopped me one night he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked at me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about the deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some doubts [noise]\nI kind of question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean\nI'm not really seeing the results yet things started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm surprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I God I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink it all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this

and we're not really seeing the results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of him\nYeah it kind of did whatever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad I feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole than it did for anything I mean two hundred people lost their jobs\nThat's a big blow to a small town like this you\nSound like you're open minded like you're giving him these two more years to kind of see what happens\nI mean if he can show results and make things happen then he'll have my

C. days before an election in which he wants to immigration to be a major issue President Trump has a new way to talk about immigration\nHe gave an interview to act CEOs in what she said that he is interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship that is still legal concept that someone born in the United states or to a U.S citizen is also entitled to be a citizen\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional in them but ... you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to human lessons well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas as soon as they kill us and it has to end\nThere was a lot in that bit of video including a number of statements that are false notably the president is wrong to say that the United states alone grants birthright citizenship many countries around the world do including Canada now let's talk about this with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell ah it it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today this was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign\nAnd here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a\nZero public activity towards actually acting on something like this until now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in drafting\nAn order like this as just a left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over a there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of vapor where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a that conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check it a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits or the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well that's right and we're talking about all that sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a\nNascent a phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of having children we should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction\nThereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious and that's\nWhat I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying um you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try and scooter\n[laughter] he may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this has catnip to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley [noise] both\nServices for the victims of the mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh begin today and that includes a service for two brothers for many in Pittsburgh Jewish community the event will begin the formal period of mourning for victims of this shooting as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports it's a process that's carefully guided by Jewish tradition\nThe two brothers who will be laid to rest Cecil in David Rosenthal were in their fifties the two youngest victims people who knew then said the brothers had intellectual disability and that they were well left by their congregation in Pittsburgh Jewish neighborhoods I think everybody in scroll Hill New down\nSharing ride Brody owns the routes sugar capital a funeral home that service mostly Jewish families in Pittsburgh I don't know anybody that didn't know\nAnd they had a smile\nAnd a hotdog or a wave for everybody\nRight friday's phone has been constantly bringing in the wake of the shooting that killed their resin brothers she deals with that every day that this isn't normal\nDeal with a tragedy like this every day thank God I'm by the time today and it's an honor to the call\nBy my community service so do whatever we need to do to help everybody get through this\nRabbi Chuck diamond who once led a congregation that tree of life says rabbis had been going to the more to be with the bodies in the days since the shooting\nWas so we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come on guard some can be with them while they're there they pray the sea salts and so it was just somebody should pass from this world by themselves it ... it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says a ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's what we call the great myths ... commandments of great good thing that we do it's very difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a day or two that timeline has been pushed back slightly because of the criminal investigations surrounding the shooting\nThere's a real desire to return to a sense of a routine and normalcy\nRabbi Aron business is the senior rabbi at congregation rose ... which is hosting the Rosenthal funeral today he explains the thinking behind a quake burial which is traditionally followed by a week of intense morning\nEven if that won't be immediate you want to get that under way the process to they're not wallowing in our grief or we're not stuck in suspended animation as we anticipated burial that's at some later date\nA funeral director says there will be heavy security and she'd expecting an enormous crowd one of the people who will be there is Marcia your um Kramer who knew about the Rosenthal brothers since they were children and they were\nJust\nJust so good just so good she will always with a smile and caring and\nWhen is certainly miss all\nThe Cecil and days and have a special place in my heart during his time leading the congregation tree of life rabbi kept diamond says that you were always there one of them out front greeting everyone who came to worship\nAt the first thing I Would see it I've always said she so you're going to trace everybody away that's why nobody's here because you're sitting there you know and he would have some resort to me and we would laugh and hug each other there's no question in my mind he was sitting in the back of the sanctuary of the trap all the time greeting people\nDr Jerry ... sixty six year old local physician will be remembered in a separate funeral today services for the rest of the eleven victims are being planned in the coming days and Jewish leaders here say there will be many months\nOf mourning Sarah McCammon NPR News

theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in the Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect wasn't active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gain traction\nEither will ... so what's a good example of how this works a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on sort of the darkest a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and ah you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and sort of mainstream politics absolutely\nPeople don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the me enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories affect the actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press to knock these things down should fall to social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when the press tries to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it's a very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and even before that\nAh but it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it ethics rather\nPolitical odds makers identified dozens of congressional districts that are in place\nIt said could go either way and will determine which party
