Bush but he was known for spontaneous moments like right after nine eleven there was this moment where he was standing on the rebel at ground zero\nThe twin towers were still smoldering in the background and he grabs a Baltimore\nWhere the president was there to tour the ruins and looking around with that sense that we all had\nHelplessness [noise] someone shouts out\nWe can hear you and the president had been trying to hurt but he suddenly her\nHair [noise] [noise] well [noise]\nPart of what made the spontaneous remarks such a hip and so much history was because he addressed this issue of retribution revenge for the event was with the country\nWas thirsty for but sometimes and more often a president's address in a moment like this is also responsive to what people are feeling but he's calling for forgiveness\nI'm thinking about President Obama shortly after the shooting at Emanuel AME church in Charleston in twenty Fifteen he breaks into song during the University of one of the [noise]\n[noise]\nUh\nUh [noise]\nHe was so moved out literally first song in that fashion and of course counting on comedy\n[noise]\nI mean these are known as that really try out different kinds of leadership skills in Egypt he's president\nAt times of national tragedy the nation is in the habit of looking for someone to play the role of sympathetic parents if you will someone to provide reassurance empathy uplift we want someone to organize our grief for us rally our spirits and begin the process of healing\nLet's talk now about how President Trump has tried to sell this role\nAfter some of the hurricanes that we've had during his presidency President Trump has gone to the side in Texas and Florida Puerto Rico and has tried to represent the country and the country's\nEmbrace of these victims at times it's worked at other times it's been quite awkward particularly in Puerto Rico and then there was the quickie news conference that he had after the Charlottesville disturbance in twenty Seventeen equating or some people felt he was drawn up on quibbling ths between some of the people who came to\nTo rally as white supremacist as white nationalist to Nazis and the people who came to protest that route\nI think is blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it is it\nDo you think this way that Trump reacts in times of tragedy do think that that's a decision he is deliberately making about how to react or is he just doesn't use uncomfortable playing the role of the empathetic controller\nIn fairness a public shows of empathy or not President Trump's strong suit he he did not promised that sort of a presidency when he ran let's face it he has a great talent for bonding with rally audiences and it's just less comfortable for him to acknowledge the sorrowful details of a tragedy such as Pittsburgh and\nFar less comfortable for him to you to critics who urge him toward introspection\nBut should president to be judged if they're not good at consoling the country in times of tragedy\nNo president should be judged solely on that one particular part of his role that he has least control of book there are going to be those people who are going to feel that the president should be able to provide something at a moment's such as this that goes beyond a political observation\nAnd address the

largely along partisan lines\nAs NPR's Tovia Smith reports wouldn't forty percent said the movement has gone too far\nAfter a year of intense focus on sexual misconduct Americans remain deeply divided even on what sexual harassment means well\nI Would say that show at dances especially repeat or any type of grabbing being initiated by the man anything that's uncomfortable\nWord um insinuation that

for draws the line I have to find a piece of paper\nThat says NAFTA follow all use rules one of the roses you can't look at a member of the opposite sex more than three seconds\nWhy so why not offend someone that makes no sense to me\nOverall forty three percent think the me too movement has gone to farm encouraging and over sensitivity for example or a rush to judgment that includes one quarter of Democrats versus three quarters of Republicans\nOh yes yes definitely\nCarol rackets Seventy four year old Republican from California is among those who say the benefit of the doubt in cases like this should not go to alleged victims I Would\nBe tempted I guess as a woman to believe the woman that to see that you know justice is done you can't there is two sides to every story\nThroughout our poll party drives opinions more than gender which doesn't surprise Clara Wilkins a social psychologist at Washington University in St Louis according to our research in sort of the way things work\nWhen there's sort of a conflict between gender and party party wins\nThat's especially true Wilkins says for those with a strong conservative ideology\nThey're more likely to think that gains for women are losses for men and so conservative women are more likely to think that maybe men in their life are going to be hurt by the me too movement or change in\nGeneral indeed our poll shows

is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I noticed that Chang mid term elections are less than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races billions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects that a total of five point two billion dollars will be spent during this entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all of that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two billion how some compare to previous mid term elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's a thirty five percent jump and a record and how\nIs this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now\nTV is still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that\nA almost a billion dollars has been spent already this cycle on media way uh uh from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media advertising on TV for the competitive races\nA digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook yeah here it's through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think well it was certainly a successful in the two thousand sixteen of election cycles for a lot of victors\nAre so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred Ninety six million dollars and uh as in terms of FCC report in digital ad spending a\nIt's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd as we said the vast bulk of all the spending is by Democrats right right you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that site has a good shot at winning or is it more than a sign of some insecurity some lack of confidence I think both\nCome into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters\nIn other states\nThat is not so helpful and election day so there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling\nAh by voters in other states that have nothing to do at the interests of the district or the state that represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it really counts\nSo that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that bombardment depressed voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout if they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMore money does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz\nIs the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nThe U.S has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the shooting up a synagogue and Pittsburgh another at a supermarket in Louisville, Kentucky and the bombs\nSuspicious packages mailed to prominent Democrats these raise the question are we entering a period of increased political violence in

congresswoman Gabby Giffords in twenty eleven the incident killed six\nAnd wounded Thirteen I have to say to him I've been surprised at the number of times we're we're in we're holding a discussion were holding a conversation across differences and some of them will actually say that they believe we could come to a civil war again in the United states but\nThen she said many people back off from their initial conclusions\nThey do say no I don't I don't really believe that will have a civil war but I find some of what I see happening frightening enough to think of it that way\nModern civil conflicts don't have to involve marching armies are Pickett's Charge conflicts emerge when episodes of political violence become more sustained so could happen in our era here's ... again\nI came of age during the Vietnam War so I came of age in a time in which differences on policy issues did lead to violent civil protests that didn't lead to blood in the streets\nSo I Do I Believe this is possible it's part of my own life experience\nAnd the concept of a civil war is seeping out into the open especially on the right the civil war and America's horizon reads the headline in last month's

identity group\nThat that's something we see here uh you know in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions the way to\nPrevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have been in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that's job and again I think as you look at the U.S today we're entering a period of of conflict but you know even if conflict is inevitable violence is not both
