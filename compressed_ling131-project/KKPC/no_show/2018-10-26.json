{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "Standard among war photographers understanding there is no playbook that everybody gets issued but I'm curious your mail photographers take that much sensitivity and advance\nI've been told that it's rare that people work the way I work that they take the time to be very respectful and to ask people\nHow they feel comfortable being photographed you know\nI also have to discuss nudity for example I was shooting maternal mortality recently in Somaliland and that's a very deeply conservative country in place and\nThey're the women you know they said okay if you photograph for example the baby coming out and I don't want my face or you have to cover or you know and they give me the rules and that's what I Do\nYou're making me think of a photograph that you took of a woman named AIPAC\nAnd this was she was raped during\nWar and South Sudan Iraq by the time you met her she was very pregnant yeah as a result of that rape you spent several hours photographing her in a dress and then you thought you know from trying to show her belly her pregnancy if that's a point here do we do this without clothes um and you know as you were photographing her showing her image\nIt's on your camera correct to make sure she understood what it looked like\nYeah and I also before I even approached her with sort of what I envisioned I went to Kimberley who was the woman who had sort of rescued her and given her the safe house and said you know does this seem insensitive how do you feel about this is this\nSomething that would be rude to ask and she said no absolutely not let's take this to her and\nSee how she feels and so we went and sort of talk to her through it and before I even finished my sentence she had taken her dress off and it was like totally she completely understood\nAnd you know as a woman I haven't been raped but I I have been assaulted in Libya I was groped repeatedly and I made a decision to talk about that very openly because I think\nYou know as a survivor it's important to try and strip away the stigma and I think different women feel comfortable revealing different things about themselves and some people do and some people don't and that's one thing I've learned over the years\nAnd I think with Iraq it was something she wanted to do she wanted to show what had happened to her to sort of talk about it it was part of her therapy and I think it's very important for me as a photographer to not make those rules for people and everyone has the right to decide how they want to portray himself you've talked in past\nAbout what a huge advantage ... if anything to be female and a lot of the places where you're trying to work because as we're hearing you have access to half of the population that are male photographer might not have access to\nWhat I loved and that kind of surprised me in this book as you also get great shots of American women there's a there's a photo going here of a navy lieutenant in the nurse corps she's stationed in Helmand Province of ... okay so the shot describe or you've caught her in the ladies' room Amy\nI mean this is after a very intense\nOr I was on a ... and um they would bring wounded soldiers out an Amy was a navy nurse and so she was you know they're in the trauma hospital\nAnd so after a an intense night I sort of followed her back to the showers where the women go and I you know I was like I Want to just shoot what your life is like here and\nShe was a completely like fun and open and got it\nShe's she's I should explain she's got shaving cream while they're up are lagging shaving that made me I look at it and I'm thinking why would you bother to shave and hell no [laughter] [laughter] I can\nTell you why because as a woman who's worked in like a very male world and in war zones for Twenty years I Do everything I can still try and feel like a woman you know whether that means like sneaking eye liner on in the middle of Helmand or lipstick or\nPerfume I always carry perfume and my camera bag H its psychological because I have to sort of maintain some semblance of myself\nYou know you're right they're shaving in the in the next shower stall [laughter]\nYeah and that was the fun of photographing women in the military because it's like it was the first time that I actually had women to hang out with because for so many years it was just me or me and my colleague Elizabeth Rubin or me and whoever the only two women for miles [noise]\nThat's when the ... talking about her new book of love and war thank you very

New York city officials are hailing a security guard who alerted police to the discovery of yet another suspicious device\nRobert De Niro his office in Manhattan today the discovery long with two packages intended for former vice president Joe Biden that were found in Delaware bringing to tend the total number of packages intercepted by authorities those when he is assistant director of New York FBI field office ...\nWe're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from a suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes an until there is a resolution this is a nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast\nAll the package bombs appear to have come from the same center targeting either democratic politicians are those critical of the administration's policies President Trump has denounced the attempted bombing but on Twitter also attacked the media living news organizations for quote the anger we see in our society\nWould probably been astray she wants to reduce what Medicare pays for some expensive cancer and arthritis drugs and NPR's Alison Kodjak reports the administration is proposing changes designed to bring those costs in line with what patients in Europe and other countries pay\nTrump says he's tired of people in other countries paying less than Americans for prescription drugs\nFor decades other countries have rigged the system so that American patience or charge much more\nEconomists disagree that American prices today are linked to prices in Europe\nBut in a speech at the department of health and Human Services Trump offered a plan that would formally tied what Medicare pays to the lower prices paid and other rich countries the plan relates only to drugs that patients receiving hospitals or a doctor offices ... says the proposal if implemented could save Medicare more than eight billion dollars\nAlison Kodjak NPR News Washington\nUs stock markets rebounded sharply today regaining some of the ground they lost in yesterday's sell off some yours Jon it she explained some positive quarterly earnings numbers help propel stocks higher\nStrong results from Microsoft Twitter and Tesla helped the market's bounced back the Dow is up more than one and a half percent the U.

the Dow NDSU ... five hundred returned to positive territory for the year after they gave up all their yearly gains and more on Wednesday\nYou've got tax issues on the ballot and there are studies to show the Denver Post had an interest in right up about this study to show that conservative turnout increases when their tax issues on the ballot\nSo these other issues may very well be influential on who turns out and of course how or who they vote for in the state Senate races or anything to add their center will just\nTypically in the mid term election as we've heard nationally the party of the president doesn't do as well and president Donald Trump didn't win in Colorado He's not extremely popular here\nYet at the same time our economy's doing really great and so Democrats are worried their voters won't won't turn out um I think that's a big concern Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was just in Colorado trying to mobilize younger voters and one of the Eighteen year olds I spoke with attended a rally and he said\nYou know he's he's nervous that a good portion of younger voters or maybe disengaged after Trump got elected they feel their voices weren't hard and they're just not going to bother and also some Democrats are just so focused on twenty twenty cars they dislike Trump so much they're forgetting about the mid term altogether [noise]\nUm so for Democrats it's just going to be critical to get voters like this engaged especially if they hope to win control of the state Senate another woman I talked to was a little bit older her name's Catherine ... also attended the Sanders rally she's retired\nShe taught at CU Boulder she's from lung mine she's unaffiliated but she leans left\nWell the people I Know are are pretty angry at the way things are and are really

in Colorado\nControl of the state Senate is up for grabs this election Republicans currently hold one seat majority\nAnd we'll be right back with what Colorado voters might learn from Oregon as they cast their votes for a proposed the constitutional amendment this is Colorado matters from CPR news\nWe're looking at decreasing clouds tonight for Colorado Springs and the Grand Junction\nIs going to be partly cloudy in metro Denver and the mountains around veil there is a chance of scattered rain and snow showers lows of forty degrees for Denver it's going to be a mostly sunny friday with highs

org\nThis is Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan ... it's one of the shortest measures on the ballot this year interest two sentences constitutional amendments Seventy four ask voters to beef up private property rights by compensating people if something government does reduces their property values\nThe primary proponents are farmers backed by big money from the oil and gas industry meanwhile state and local governments are virtually in a panic over its potential passage CPR as Grace Hood takes a closer look\nThis year's drought has thrown the economic hammer down on farmer mark ...\nWe had one of the toughest we crops we've ever had in our history they had a lot of hail that came at the wrong time and basically cut our harvests about ten percent of what we would expect\nTo about two hundred yards away at fruit cuts aluminum siding for a small shed or Nashville's around his water pumps [noise]\nSupplemental income from water sales is one of the few bright spots in our initials operation he sells it to noble energy for oil and gas development aren't issues behind the push for amendment\nSeventy four if the government suddenly answer restrictions that decreases the value of his water amendment Seventy four it would make it easier for our ... to get compensated for his law\nWhen you talk about uh taking to somebody that owns a home or owns a small business they they have a hard time making that connection but to a farmer takings is everything\nTakings happens one properties acquired damaged or simply reduced in fair market value by the government in addition to water the measure seeks to protect mineral rights and private property\n... with the Colorado Farm Bureau says the process for compensation would play out in the courts right now property owners get paid when losses are between Seventy and Ninety percent he\nThinks it's time for new guidelines\nIt'll allow them to look back at that economic standard and say maybe there isn't just one exact number that we have to go forward\nWith is it appropriate to have a number that's below fifty percent\nI think in the depending on the scenario when you're looking at takings cases they're very scenario specific\nAmendment Seventy four got financial backing from the oil and gas industry as a mineral owners energy companies could stand to benefit but the intentionally vague language is drawing sharp words from critics\nEvery few years we get a piece of legislation that comes along and his\nDemocratic governor John Hickenlooper slammed the proposal at a recent rally against them and that Seventy four he's part of a bipartisan coalition his comments were followed by Republican Colorado Springs mayor Johnson others\nIt is stupid but I like to refer to as as a wolf in sheep's clothing\nSouthern says the state and us constitutions already have sufficient protections for private property and the courts are already operating well\nThere is no exception and this language that the government is motivated by health safety and welfare the only test is argue diminishing the value of my property in any way\nSome say Colorado should learn from Oregon's experience twelve years ago Oregon voters put a similar measure in place farmers wanted compensation for a lot that they felt limited their ability to develop land they made their case around Ninety year old farm widow Dorothy English and wanting to build homes for relatives on our property\nAnd the ... which doesn't even though the state like planning says she can't do that\nBob cc oppose the measure but Oregon voters passed it Stacy says there were unintended consequences\nVague language allow timber companies to consider plans to develop housing on undeveloped land rural voters weren't happy ultimately Oregonians cast votes on a second ballot measure with revised language\nThere's just compensation and then there's unjust enrichment and measure thirty something unjust enrichment\nBut the Colorado Farm Bureau disagrees it says the detail required by Oregon's process has already made local leaders there consider how their development policies affect property values next month Colorado voters will decide whether to get state property owners a new layer of protection\nI'm Grace hood CPR news\nLet's take a deeper look now at what happened in Oregon you heard from Bob Stacey increases story he's a member of the metro council it's a regional governments in the Portland area and he's passed executive director of a group that work to modify the original measure and so Bob welcome to the program for stuff\nThanks for having me that there's been a very long fight in Oregon over property rights and that came to a head in about two thousand four when Oregon voters passed this measure thirty seven\nAs we heard the face of it was a woman who wanted to build homes on her ex urban land outside Portland just briefly tell us how the measure was worded and what it did\nSure um measure thirty seven [noise] the the ballot title says government must pay or forego enforcement when certain land use regulations reduce property value [noise] which is a pretty attractive premise\nAnd then the campaign for the measure featured Dorothy English Ninety year old widow she and her husband had bought property outside of Portland in the rural area\nI'm back in the sixties and then discovered when it came time to divide and provide home sites for family members on that property that they couldn't do that because it was now designated for farm and forestry\nAnd along with other people who found themselves in that situation they supported organizations like Oregonians that action that one of the get rid of land use ... and an successfully campaigned to repeal Oregon's like he was planning\nTo a successful elections in the seventies and one in the eighties and then under took a\nLong term effort to\nAdvocate for property rights over\nA natural resource and farmland protection\nAnd so thirty seven comes about and as you described it it really gave landowners property owners to avenues one they could be compensated by government if something government did affected the the value\nOf land or a ... if the community didn't want to compensate I guess ... financially or they could say OK these rules don't apply to you\nProgram thinking and rubber pleased\nTo have you on the show why did the flu season of Nineteen Eighteen become a global pandemic\nSo suddenly one of the factors that resulted in global transmission of this virus was it was really the time the era and this was in the middle of World War one and so there was a lot of movement tens of troops that was really sort of unprecedented for the time that really results\nTransmission across the globe of this virus okay uh that kind of movement is probably is unlike anything the world is seen to the point that is correct okay uh well what made it spread so quickly beyond about [noise]\nYeah so this was um you know any kind of an influenza pandemic it it means that there's a new influenza virus\nThat individuals do not really have an existing immune response to and so because of that people are highly susceptible to that infection and it can easily spread from person to person it also means potentially that people can have much more severe outcomes because their immune system has not seen that divers ... previously\nIt can really result in much greater rates of hospitalization or even mortality\n... uh was Nineteen Eighteen the the worst pandemic put it into some context for us\nIt is so it is known as the mother of all pandemics for a reason on so it is it certainly was I think the really the largest pandemic to this day that um the globe has experience so as you mentioned tens of millions of deaths occurred worldwide including deaths of course here in Colorado\nHow does it compare to the ... goes\nSo the black death I did have higher mortality rates but it was much more confined again going back to that idea that because of all of this troop movement um there were really cases that occurred across the globe\nSo as we were researching this topic we found this pandemic really hits home for people we were discussing it around our editorial meeting and my colleague Andrea Dukakis recalls the effect on her\nFamily my father's side of the family were Greek immigrants and\nI'd always heard about the Nineteen Eighteen flu epidemic because shortly after they arrived in the U.S\nThe epidemic hit and um everyone was sick in the family my great grandfather died so did the oldest brother in the family um and I heard stories about carts being driven around towns and picking up dead bodies everyone was just terrified of getting sick\nWhat accounts have you heard [noise]\nYeah so there are lots of different stories that that occurred like come out of Colorado history books I'm so one um one particular community that but it's very hard hit was silver ten Colorado I'm so silver tend obviously had a large mining population\nAnd during the Nineteen Eighteen pandemic it was really that population of twenty to forty year old that were hardest hit which I think it was a large percentage of the silver ten community the mining community\nAnd and during the pandemic their stories of of you know hundreds of deaths occurring in silver ten I'm In one night alone ten that's occurring um the city hall was converted to a makeshift hospital to house people they didn't have\nEnough resources to deal with the dead bodies um also stories about not having sufficient medical care there please and the city\nI'm really to have medical personnel sent to the town to to help says\nDid you find that there were big differences in how the flu hit different communities in Colorado and how they responded\nAbsolutely so Gunnison is is a community that was really known as an escape community at the time so gun is and I think very differently from silver ten and other communities in Colorado\nI'm very early on us to establish some very strict quarantine requirement so they put up barricades to the city they did not allow cars to pass through they stopped trains anyone that want it to get off in Gunnison had to go into a force quarantine for several days\nI'm close schools very early lots of strict measures in place that that did ultimately protect the town of Gunnison\nBut it actually works but it wasn't just a sort of fear mongering step\nNo absolutely well I I Would say that there certainly was the year ... there were a neighboring communities that we're ... we're seeing very high mortality rates and very high um attack rates lots of cases occurring and neighboring communities and so I think gun if it was very proactive\nOne theory is that the Nineteen Eighteen flu originated to just over the Colorado border in Kansas\nAnd as we've been spread with the movement of us soldiers in World War one uh I don't know you'd think it would have appeared in the coastal states you know maybe brought in by trends is you know the trouble what's this Kansas theory\nYou know so the Kansas theory um so so the the pandemic occurred in several waves largest wave you mentioned was the second wave the fall of Nineteen Eighteen but earlier in the spring including as early as of January there were documented cases cases that report it to the federal government\nThat occurred in the town of Haspel Kansas that were the severe influenza are pneumonia type cases that were very unusual to the the medical provider that what that was taken care of these patients\nAnd then we also know that individuals from that community then later on moved to Fort Fort ... know Fort oh I Can't remember the name of a fortune near Manhattan, Kansas okay I'm a military training facility where um\nWhere a large outbreak occurred in the spring and so going back to hassle Kansas one of the reasons that hassle Kansas has been targeted is not only did those early cases appear but\nHaskell and that area of the country are really part of a large migratory flight away and we do know that um there's lots of belief there's lots of research sound that this virus really as of avian origin and so we believe that perhaps this came out of wild birds then within domesticated birds and then transmitted to humans\nAre that's fascinating ah might just be Fort Riley I think it was camp funds to negotiate over him funds to another life recall furiously Google hope you wrote [noise] ah what kinds\nOf responses to juicy in Colorado that that made no sense [noise] um because I think that there were folks taking steps that maybe weren't really helpful\nSo lots of interesting things on steam bath were promoted there were recommendations to not eat meat there were um all sorts of sadness and creams and lotions and things you can imagine certainly um lots of fresh air was recommended a but a lot of the social distancing measures those measures that are put in place I'm\nReally to prevent transmission were also haphazardly applied so things like I'm On street cars the the windows were required to be open but people complained and so then they closed every other window and things like requiring people to wear masks and certain settings but not other settings closing churches and theaters\nPerhaps not closing other types of businesses so to some of those measures were applied not universally and and I think to this day our understanding of a social distancing measures that they certainly can work but they do need to be applied consistently\nNo I think of Colorado in this era so we're talking about Nineteen Eighteen we're looking back a hundred years to the global flu pandemic but I think of Colorado in that era as being a destination for people with tuberculosis ... the idea was that the the air here was good for your lungs\nA wouldn't they have been more vulnerable to flu\nYes I think we we certainly know to this day that individual but chronic medical conditions including respiratory conditions are at increased risk for severe outcomes did influence so absolutely that population would have been a greater risk\nOkay anything we've learned from Nineteen Eighteen that's still valuable\nSo I think we've and we've learned a lot about and the immune response to to viruses and how novel virus has really can impact um populations you know there's been lots of work done to reconstruct this virus and try and study the very on factors against needed but the virus one question\nIs could it happen again right that has to be in scientists mines\nSo certainly I think we are always vulnerable to pandemics I think one of the one of the you know very I think helpful things we have now is antibiotics so a lot of the cases that occurred in Nineteen Eighteen we're\nI'm caught that influenza virus secondary bacterial in pneumonia and so we now have antibiotics to treat those individually also of course have vaccine and anti viral medications and lots of things now that I'm I think would\nI think decrease the transmission of fire\nSo it's the secondary things that people died from not necessarily the initial flu infection and what have people learn by studying the Nineteen Eighteen flu I mean even I'm perplexed as to how you do that\nYeah so there was interesting reconstruction of this virus really trying to isolate on DNA segments from individuals that had previously died of the Nineteen Eighteen flu and out of tissue specimens they were able to reconstruct the virus and and learn about how this virus you know differently than other influenza viruses really did have\nA strong affinity for the lower respiratory tracks that really did cause lower respiratory tract or pneumonia type symptoms and people perhaps more so than other types of influence that have the ability to do\nAnd then there's also interesting um studies that have been trying to look at why\nCertain age groups which means twenty and forty were particularly vulnerable to the flu\nOr which you've you've you've hinted at in this conversation\nYes yes so so really we think that that population of twenty to forty year old had during the early childhood experience to a different type of influenza virus and that really influenced\nUm their immune response to the Nineteen Eighteen virus and really resulted in them having an ineffective R D is regulated immune response and made them particularly vulnerable than to secondary patrimony up\nHow did you study a flu virus from Nineteen Eighteen like how do you begin to map what it would look like\nYet thank you thank you all um even on conservative I'm optimistic about Saudi Ocasio Cortez wouldn't\nWhy is that of course yeah for me because\nI have this opinion which have term limits and Congress because\nI think that's when I showed that I'm representing for the people by the people coming back in the style proudly were there for year\nThey didn't really care about her district because he had gotten already so Washington or whatever\n... basically told if I'm going to care about you and if we go back to that where people and their tentative are caring about them their constituents not necessarily about national that support that's necessary but about their national policy that will be amazing I Hope that's on step in the right direction for not only hurt for everybody\nHit where yeah look we're epicenter of caring about their local populace is\nSo so let me ask you you a question so how much does what's happening in in Washington and what we've been talking about in terms of um the president's the president's rhetoric and the inaction in gridlock in Washington how much of that\nOr concerns you or are you focus locally on what your state and local officials officials are doing to um to help your help your neighbors help you\nHonestly I have to think about the rhetoric and stuff like that I think we've come to the point where I Want to try to get there twenty second soundbites and that's not helpful but I personally would rather focus back together and what you focus on their local things take care of your local issues\nI Know build up for six years city than fix your faith than fix what yet good qualified people arriving to the ranks of tumor national politics data and become president center and what\nBetter qualified people not just reactionary\nSalt in Brooklyn thank you very much for calling into America on the line and Helen Peterson Brian Lehrer been an interesting calls we've gotten from people around the country I Would love 'em just for us to end the show talking about getting your reactions to what you heard and Helen how about we start with you\nYou know I really think that it's one of those things where you know there's this old steady about how\nPeople ... perception of how much violence there was in there in the world like in the United states it there was a correlation with how much violence they saw on television on how much violence was depicted in the TV shows they watched and so they just got the sense watching shows is late seventies\nThat oh there is violence on the show so that means that there's also violence in my world and I think that our media diets you know I'm not going to go back to the\nThe ... like there needs to be a new more good news in the world but I think that the more you know glued we our ... our phones into these quick\nTake you know like there's just a lot of things that are really suck that are happening and it's hard to have the balance summits that to think about you know not personal like developments in your personal life developments in your community\nAnd your kids' lives you know things that that either way's paint a more holistic portray it instead of thinking about like oh we're screwed and so I think that there is I've just watched people who are more likely to the staff\nFeel sadder feel you know like a real depression and you know I think that the fears warranted but at the same time there is as this program has emphasized something to be optimistic about\nAnd Brock Obama at the end of his term used to talk about how we are living in the best time and all of human history to be alive but at the major metrics of poverty and life expectancy and things like that and if you take a big step back\nYou can say from a progressive point of view or if you put just a little bit of an optimistic spin on it that we have been moving for the last century so an steadily in the direction of social justice\nAnd it's not a straight line hardly a straight line or in a period of major backlash right now\nBut look where we were in this country in this world a hundred years ago a and it is possible that still the arc of the moral arc of history is long but it does been toward justice if we've been to\nUh I like to tell people are in in speeches just how wonderful ... this country is and how far we've come and to bring that point home I tell

obviously want the best players so there are scouting and competition in recruiting them and I think most of us would figure this would focus on high school players you know juniors and seniors who who proved that they have the chops and they visit their families they do what whatever to try and get them interested in their program\nI learn from your book this starch much much earlier how young are players when they started getting attention\nFifth or sixth grade players are as young as\nTen or eleven years old when the basketball ... the scouts start looking at them and saying are you a future college prospect are you a future NBA prospect\nAnd there are several reasons for this one of them is the size of players who make it to a big time college basketball and the NBA\nYou know there's somewhere between six foot three\nAnd seven feet and up so that really narrows the population so if you're looking\nAt a young kid you're going to mostly look at a kid who's already begun already athletic\nAnd for that reason and some other reasons it has a relatively easier and basketball to look at a sixth or seventh grader and correctly say this kid's going to be at least the college player so it becomes worse it for the scouts\nTo then prow the sidelines of fifth and sixth grade basketball tournaments\nAre their national publications or online sites that actually rate these players that\nHave a lot of readers yes\nThere are publications\nAnd scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called hope scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis who I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know spends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from\nFive or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who reiterated the highest\nLot of them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so we certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what clerk Francis does whether you take them seriously or not is he lays down a foundation\nFor people who then scout high school and middle school players\nAnd he sort of sets the sort of number of players who may be looked at and\nThe recruiting services are and other business and other way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots\nBasketball network explain who runs that how it works\nThe main recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIs no longer high school basketball you know high school game features maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid so what's the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit\nAnd that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations that's where the college coaches go to scout and the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball\nAnd sunny was a brilliant salesmen in a in a brilliant sort of hustler in his own way\nSo he realized the two things one was that to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realized that big time college coaches really don't want to go to a small town small town\nThat scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando\nAnd stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\n... so you had these tournaments that occur I'm In Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the ... and we're talking about middle school kids in a lot of cases right and there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of\nSpecialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture forests\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grass roots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are they're just sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploitive they are dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nOr their kids to when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who referred to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\nMm\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's ... that's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who\nFirst make contact with a young player and his family they\nFly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing their head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids they're thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many that had coaches say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nIt was clearly not the first time the Brian bone senior had taken money he testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money\nRepeatedly um four in return for his son playing for a particular used teams or particular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins wanted the the runner these street agent said Brian bow and senior on cross examination so you've been pimping out your namesake since he was fourteen years old\nAnd Bryan Boone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old\nRight and is there any evidence that Brian bone and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nRyan Bowen junior had told the FBI and\nHe told me when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know the money was exchanged that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he didn't know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina took him in\nIs an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said you can't play basketball\nLast year and then ruled that he could not play college basketball this year and Brian bone junior has gone off to play professionally in Australia a and is over there now in Sydney has become one of\nA thousand overseas player is trying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino is that the coach was on the cover of the book um the book is kind of about this system of corruption in recruitment but but Pitino is a fascinating character [noise]\nUm you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanna Kentucky\nWon at Louisville he also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMarquee franchises in professional basketball\nIn college basketball and particularly at Louisville he did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called the lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the corn off in one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is a a predictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\nAnd she was sent off to prison or but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just\nMet in a bank get everybody left the restaurant was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pacino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men [noise] the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of\nIn the basketball dorm\nNot very far from ... office\nSponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the in in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was road to be permissible benefits to amateur players\nAnd Louisville actually lost two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of in that was sort of strike one strike too and this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involved Louisville\n... was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\nAnd in a stripper gate case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem\nAnd Pitino does not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Pitino has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary\nAnd he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nMike ... book is

basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked what the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was\nThat the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\nI mean this is fascinating she is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really they showed us how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating other people and and how overwhelming\nOn an individual level that can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware as miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know this Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways over this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and\nI teach this I lecture on this any sort of doubt you might have had about his technique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything he can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put him back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of that but tell tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen or another accuser has come forward the same her name is Rachel ... she also comes forward publicly in a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police it's detective ... and she definitely takes a different approach\nOr she is working ... name of his own\nGoals you know I wouldn't have been over ... characters or would you like ... if I've temperature is not a huge pushing off to her\nWell look I I'm again this was something to try to me is very different than how she described her stray it\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest where the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that demand for it comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records\nAnd so India believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on\nMasks are it's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nThere was a arousal is is is very much because of her home in a much larger world [noise]\nMiddle of a few interactions your immune but I don't actually around here but you know you're you're saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea month for one of whom she talks about looking back at this interview is that she herself\nWas kinda unsure why NASA are would have so much trouble answering such a simple questions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his answer he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation for you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least hearing the victim out yeah\nWell I mean fundamentally this is how guys like this operate is they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just a great guy could be hurting somebody as humans were not good at thinking that can ...\nAnd to the people that we work with or who are family but the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail these women and girls for so long [noise]\nKate Wells and Lindsey Smith are hosts of the new podcast believed from Michigan Radio and NPR thank you both so

those things for us that's crazy that is crazy we would probably have exploded even more if we had the housing in place\nBecause right now so many of these workers that are living in the arby's travel

D bones were blown\nUp like the to solve the immigration issue the sure to be able to return to judge just go to though because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras are sort of put in the\nPhysical structure because where you're going to put\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people and let you go are you going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nWhere you over [noise]\nMeanwhile people like Amanda ... a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her backyard\nThat she did with us from Madison and just like that were in Mexico [noise] the the exchange faces right here where the dollar exchange so this is talk of media we walked down the main streets filled with bars [noise]\nAnd stores selling all kinds of Mexican handicraft we thought that one storefront where a woman is sewing handmade dolls dressed in colorful dress as\nHe actually making them if not in the heat and they're not coming from China these are authentic they cannot\nAdd a check to check in with a smile she nudges her long black hair over her shoulder and waved goodbye and the guessing her white SUV and waste in the long line to cross back over into the U.S [noise]\nShe'll return in a few days though she has dresses that need tailoring [noise]\nFrom Del Rio Texas this is NPR News\nYeah MORNING EDITION is spending a lot of time today in Texas in one particular congressional district\nNow this is CPR news and there is a lot of Colorado politics and election coverage at CPR dot org for example check out our podcast called ... CPR sand brash looks at Colorado's purple politics and how they got that way\nAnd the road trip to November a lot of stories great pictures from all around Colorado where our reporters who have been going over the past few weeks and you know it's a kind of getting time to think about returning that ballot and if you haven't done that yet you can get some good information from our voters guide and that is at CPR dot org [noise]\nI might lamp good morning Sunday weekend the head and for today all across Colorado eyes in the sixties around Colorado Springs and in Denver forties in the mountains and getting warmer or through the weekend CPR [noise]\nBut they're super PACs turned to have a pretty broad business coalition you see ... or ... or you see um\nStay developers I'm giving big money Democrats also have big money though they're not the party of small money in Colorado they get a lot of money from education reformers [noise] ah there's a big liberal dark money group called the sixteen thirty fond we're not exactly sure who's behind that but they're dumping a lot of money into the Senate race and so\nReally unprecedented levels of spending of the superPAC level and he's right now what about direct contributions to candidates in the state Senate races actually feel like this is the more interesting story because the Democrats are vastly outrageous and the Republicans in these races so\nTammy story for instance she's up against him novel that's a two to one money advantage and direct contributions\nFaith winter has a four to one advantage over best Martinez she met at the Republican and what's interesting to these democratic candidates are getting money from out of state at levels far outstrip during the Republican candidate so\nThere's enthusiasm even outside the state of Colorado for these races but they're just getting a lot of contributions from you know two thousand contributions for winter when her opponents only getting a few hundred\nLady with the lead of the Democrats or does that mean there's just more enthusiasm on the Democratic side events huh\nIt's hard to say can also mean that Democrats may be just have a superior fundraising machine when it comes to the hard side and that would maybe make sense with families mentioning when it comes to ... out of state contributions\nBut given the Republican money coming from superPACs and the south side they certainly have enough to get their message out and Democrats say they're even more money flowing from the G O P side that isn't being tracked there's also this question of diminishing returns when you had so much money flowing around\nFocused and really just a handful of racism even among now is just a couple or the absolute most competitive our voters getting this overload\nBend there is other political money flowing through the state that could affect Democrats is that right\nSo the oil and gas industry has an issue group this is called protect Colorado it has\nMore money than any group has ever had in Colorado history almost forty million dollars they're spending big money on the ballot issues but a lot of the voters they're gonna target are gonna be probably conservative and Republican voters so when you talk to conservatives\nAnd you say look there's a big money disadvantage for you in the state Senate races they go yeah but we're going to be bullied by a couple of things in a the oil and gas money which is not going to be advocating for candidates directly but we'll be targeting voters that may help conservative candidates were also\nYou've got tax issues on the ballot and there are studies to show the Denver Post had an interest in right up about this study is to show that conservative turnout increases when their tax issues on the ballot\nSo these other issues may very well be influential on who turns out and of course how or who they voted for in the state Senate races anything to add their center\nWell just typically in the mid term election as we've heard nationally the party of the president doesn't do as well and president Donald Trump didn't win in Colorado He's not extremely popular here\nYet at the same time our economy's doing really great and so Democrats are worried their voters won't turn out thanks for being with us both of you to give thanks rain\nCPR spent in Brooklyn and then markets talking with us about the balance of power in Colorado control of the state Senate is up for grabs this election Republicans currently hold the one seat majority\nOh\nThe elections make David Ross men feel poetic that's a good thing since he's our resident poets he's written something new for us it's called enough and before he reads it he's going to tell us a little bit about it\nSo I wrote this ah sometime in the last couple of months thinking about what's going on politically and socially and culturally in our country looking at what I think we're all seeing is an increasing temperature in every conversation it seems like in in so many public interactions\nSo one of the things that poetry can do it seems to me is to\nEmbody certain kinds of contradictions in a very dense compact manner and I wanted to talk about the nature of our civil discourse to the best of my ability\nAnd of course I did it in a sonnet would you love palm always in one way or another so it's a love for them to do all of us and to our frankly to our country\nOkay here's David Ross men reading enough\nThere has to be a better way than this the frantic pace obscuring what time means\nThe endless sense that something is amiss the numbing cold upon the flickering screens there has to be\nA better way to live where rage and outrage tire of their strip tease where we realized that to get we have to give\nWe're opponents are not enemies we'd better find a way to cool it down we'd better learn to have more conversations we need to learn that we're a common ground admit some calculus variations otherwise well you'd think this is rough I've never heard of fire say enough\n\nI'm Ryan ... this is CPR news\nYou're listening to end up news from Colorado Public radio on Ninety point one F.

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the Texas twenty third congressional district which is a rare swing district in this very red state\nThat covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going to their minds ahead of the midterms\nPresident Trump has made immigration a central issue in the upcoming vote warning about the influx of migrants from Central America who are coming through Mexico towards the U.S the president hammer at this point again during a rally in Houston earlier this week\nBut we wanted to know how the issue is playing here along the border which is where we are right now I'm looking out over lake ... which connects to the Rio Grande river\nThat river is the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico only started means friendship and Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is wills and together with the town on the other side a coon yeah Mexico\nWe're a family and this border\nThis is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them and they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I wanted him to come here the right way\nAmanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph\nLots of grew up here like I think it would be like some tea okay I really would be in a hot humid recruiters are highly hockey is often a manned across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week\nWhat takes you that I have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over there and then to have sympathy\nFor people who are seeking a better life in the U.S [noise] but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight it because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico\nNow ... ... ... when they say separate or what there is a well I think you know if anybody back and if you went to you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nOf his roommate was rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months I think we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's linked up before he bought his starts talking about the border wall\nThe new suit in this natural state people up north like who is a war zone at her\nTo me before he started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years and he says it can't be fixed with a wall\nBecause for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem\nThere perks sheriff's\nThat'll do for others much at all\nJust across this little yes it's even a river this looks like a lake or encourage the river and remember how many feet are we talking\nAbout ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigners\nI mean that's the hardest across\nSo a ninth someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road ... I asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to bigger cities and even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger ...\nGina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump but this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support that people like chef Martinez\nWill ever come to an air of giving them the same tour a like well here's your self that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or if we were over there everybody else was even the bones were below me\nAnd I think that to solve the immigration issue the sure to be at the table you can't you can't just go to though because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras a set of putting a physical structure because where you're going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nOr you go to put these people in Mexico are you going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nMeanwhile people like Amanda gear a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her\nBackyard

straight yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get back together I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\nActually there 'cause I put in more hours and then [laughter] and people can be about as much as you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even let's campaign staffers stay in our house so it was it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware politically but I've also been complacent\nI mean look around wearing this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about my history I Wish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't think it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the

Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race\nAgainst Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door it all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign\nThen he and others on the site talked about rigging there are signs with a pow record to

Trump Hi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally\nAnd Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how well it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be in more\nEveryone likes the direction that the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries that are coming from and coming through two songs to flow a it's very concerning\nAnd ah there's just no accounting for all these people\nFlowing in I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit where Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded\nI blocked walked with a liberal over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and the because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um [noise] I guess I Would close by just asking if you could

Hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in\nPolitics but something that's\nReally nice um but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that\nIs more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise a and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he'd motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in his mid term election of President Trump is struggling on that front as the polls show that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but\nIn twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet oval ... in the suburbs of San Antonio same thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated and it's in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here\nWhat about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out the sheer\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election President Trump two thirds say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs in the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats health care and climate change a notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than touching title means\nAnd fears of medical months in our across the Midwest it's grain harvest\nThe same time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans and third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\n[noise] rented office and harvest ladies in ...

just kind of rolling with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op he says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI've contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen's more concerned with bringing in his crop\nMost of us will be glad when this year is just over\nThe agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to

to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina went and bought a lot of friends from Argentina left them a bit too short they had to kill them into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days of farmers are razor focused on just getting in this lake crop but with terrorists
