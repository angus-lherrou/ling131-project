more presentable I thought I'm I was careful about I spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed\n'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was silent about him I never called out the races and like what well one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas\nAnd he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath\nAnd we could all pick a gift and it was like gag gift like will be ... and all of this other stuff he's just trying to get rid of\nAnd when it was my turn I picked the gifts\nAnd there was a prescription drug book inside and a toy water good\nAnd one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and because some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to um and that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up and honestly\nThey defining moment for me because I had to realize that hour's worth speaking up for if nothing else and that they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinating was this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white [noise] it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tell star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes to a cop smile when they pull ... out of hiding something costs though\nBut you still don't know if they did anything wrong\nWhile we searched but if they open the door or reached through an open window they're probably going for with so far I think I see a gun I don't hesitate ... it was so\nInteresting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just wide against black racism it's much more complicated right you're ... you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught in some time that system could be taught African Americans as well so you have that version and and it also you have another layer on top of it is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys on their side ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of a sixteen year old do you think audiences are more capable of empathy when they're watching a kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving this kind of trauma\nUnfortunately yeah yeah yeah when I first decided to ride it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction fan anyway and I always knew I wanted to write young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because they'll often victims in these cases are teenagers or young people and Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve and\nI think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that one adult pick this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl than a thirty year old woman\nUm for some audiences there's something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence\nWho has so little experience you literally witness this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma and I think there's something about that at least for adults there's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\n[noise] rider Angie Thomas and director George ... their new movie is called the hate you give thank you both very much it was a real pleasure to talk

effort to get\nYou know women to drink tank can get you a drink and I I'm just have like show women wear that hard alcohol is right away in an effort to loosen them up or um it's really just coercion into most often times turning initial rejection into a yes and that's the way a lot of men had been ties\nYou know if you get told no initially\nKeep trying you know no it doesn't mean now that means try harder it means what else can I Do to make this no turn into a yes\nOr more people joining men in the movement it's yes you in this environment\nUm it's been about the same for about five years and\nMy guess\nIn terms of what the barriers for more men to come in is that there are\nMany many men who are good dark tons of men who don't like the UN is objects or had sexually assaulted anyone in life there's\nWay more of those kinds of men than there are men who had perpetrate a sexual assault and I think the barrier is that they think that that's good enough and won't go that extra step to actually work against\nWhat is happening right so the problem is that that maintains a status quo so we need more men to like take that extra step to engage in the conversation opposed to just saying you know what I Am a good guy adults actually that's all people I'm good\nI Want to have you respond to what the president has said about this being a very scary time for young men the statistics show that the prevalence of false reporting on sexual assault is between about two and ten percent is this a scary time for young men\nI think it's scary for a certain type of dude I have confidence that my guys are scared because they're not going to rape they understand what consent means and how it works and so\nIt's interesting to parse out the type of man who is scared and this time and to me it's hard to\nThink that it's not a good thing because if you're scared and maybe you'll be more careful about your actions what I have a hard time with specifically\nA President Trump saying that is he saying that if there's consequences for men who are accused and we see if we have two examples now the president who's been accused by\nI don't know Nineteen what is it twenty\nWomen something like that and the judge Kavanaugh by at least three that we know of um and so to say\nThat I just underscore that these are all in the realm of accusation and not charges or convictions\nRight and men are going to leave survivors and I think that's kind of uh the way we go off of and talk about these kinds of things I think men who are scared equate false accusations with\nBeing found not guilty right just because someone doesn't go all the way the court or just because someone doesn't go through it official process doesn't mean it's a false accusation above the accusation is to get through the process all the way to his court on it and it was it's bound to be false sense I don't know I\nKnow it it does it does make sense I'm interested in how you answer this question William about as the president says this being a very scary time for young men and I'll just interject the the count as a at least twenty two women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct dating back to the seventies but go ahead or William\nYeah I think there are thought reaction that should be afraid it's\nBest to a certain point but I can understand how they have certain men could be scared and those certain men probably should be scared because they're also probably perpetrators\n'cause yeah we we know suggest to you as you said that the false reports at Central is are like so so low and jumping and other people I just have made it seem that hundreds of thousands of men are being falsely accused like every second of every day\n[noise] I Wonder if you are as we wrap up here you might give us two or three action items men can take to make the culture for women safer\nI Do think humility as one of the key\nValues that the men who go to the program and walk away with\nSo an action item related to that is to be humble and listening to women and transgender folks about their stories and it is incredibly easy to access stories now because we we as his men had been given this enormous gift that isn't me too movement\nI Wonder if you struggle with your own fears that this could just become one more example of sort of men is the Knight in shining armor you know rescuing the damsel in distress is there something fundamentally about this conversation\nThat implies in any way that you know women can't help themselves\nI think that's a great question and I think that's why one of the leading\nSort of values but I think about is humility because if you approach\nEngaging in gender based violence conversations with the angle of humility it's really difficult to get into the I'm going to be the Knight in shining armor here\nSo once you begin to understand fully the roles of men and addressing a Cherokee and sexual violence you start to see that there is absolutely an avenue

the dirtiest words in American politics it's when people draw congressional or legislative districts to benefit somebody often themselves and it takes the blame for a wide range of problems with our democracy\nRigged elections voiceless minorities partisan polarization\nAnd no shortage of hurt feelings\nMy experience on the reinforcement commission was um it was probably the most uh discouraging experience I've ever had in politics [noise]\nThis is Rob ... a former Republican state lawmaker Marcus\nRelevant to this topic I served on the reports from a commission which draws a state legislator minds in two thousand women\nJust commission formed after the twenty times fences and job was to draw the boundaries of each legislative district outline the voters who'd be served by each Colorado State senator and representative\nWas the beginning of the commission on the very first day that we met I read a letter into the record and I asked the other ten commissioners let's do it differently this time\nWe were said let's not decide on maps with a simple majority we should all be able to agree here\nAt the end of the day my my plea and my hope was do we pass them how to get both Republican votes and democratic vote and it would be a consensus outcome that approach was not accepted by either party I was asked what was the reaction when you read that letter and I think that the probably the most descriptive word is crickets\n[noise] at that point it becomes a partisan process so I Do fault of their being a Republican member of the commission\nWhat does that mean like what were you advocating for when it came to you know fighting for Republican interest on this mission\nRoaming the partisans on the on the commission their job is is I mean just to put it bluntly is to drum out that's going to let the most members of their party possible I mean that's really what this comes down to it is purely a play for power and whichever party has the most votes who's going to draw the most favorable map\n[noise]\n... where he says that's what happened Democrats admitted maps at the last minute after what he thought was the final deadline\nThis is after months of process big scandal Denver Post reported on it didn't matter the next day we had a vote\nAnd the single independent on the panel voted with the Democrats to approve the map right away it was seen as a Republican live the new boundaries knocked out from the European come in and it created more competitive seats where Democrats had a shot of winning\nWhere you've got to Congress person who's really focused on your concerns because everybody in this district share something or do you want to live in a district where maybe there are a lot of very different kinds of communities in it but your Congress person has

brush\nTo understand how they work let's start with how they were first conceived\nTheir handful of us who served in the legislature together who still get along and so I sent an email around just say hey let's get together for lunch\nThis is again former Republican representative Robert ... where we heard from him at the top of the episode about his experience on Colorado's legislative reapportionment committee and twenty eleven twenty Fifteen\nHe invited some of his old buddies from the state legislature for lunch at an Irish pub in Denver they weren't all from the same party but they did share one thing emotional scars and lingering frustration for previous redistricting battles\nBernie was there [noise] ah my name is ... I'm I'm a resident of Grand Junction Colorado and the Democrat served with Robert Mueller and the\nState house we're just getting together because we wanted to catch up on\nWhat each of us was doing he doesn't remember what you ate\nI've probably probably had a salad I've probably been undercut that with a side order fries [laughter] I'm pretty sure I had the salmon Caesar [noise] um and we got we got to discussing\nA politics where I was doing ... policy and we'd redistricting came up I think there was just a a unanimous feeling around the table why can't this get fixed everybody sees what's wrong with it it's just patently obvious that this was a broken system how come it hasn't been fixed until now and and you\nKnow we're all legislators we used to serve in the legislature so it's very easy to say you know it isn't as good as when we were there [laughter] and and how do we make it better for us but we ... we kind of agreed on five six seven principles that would be involved in doing this right\nIt was these principles that formed the backbone of what's now y and Z and they have to overarching goals you prevent partisan gerrymandering and strike a balance between keeping communities together and encouraging competition so first idea to do that\nThe commissions are to have equal representation from unaffiliated\nIn other words the panel should have the same number of Democrats or Republicans and unaffiliated voters\nBut we also believe that the decision making should be done by a super majority\nSo that you just don't have one person who's vote swings the outcome\nThe idea was to require a bipartisan compromise and they decided that compromise should be struck in public not some back board room with a bunch of well paid politicos\nThis entire process should be subject to open meetings and open records and as transparent as possible there should be neutral criteria that don't favor either party\nThat means the district should have to conform to city and county lines wherever possible and they should be ... weird so quickly shapes that don't make any sense and if the commissioners managed to meet those goals\nThese commissions should promote the maximum number of competitive district\nThe first respect communities and then whenever possible draw competitive districts this group of former lawmakers walked out with a plan\nIt was by no means an easy route onto the ballot the state Supreme Court shut down at first attempt in twenty sixteen and this year they had to merge it with competing redistricting proposal from a coalition of progressive groups finally last may the state legislature referred y and Z to the ballot in\nColorado at its best and I think we've got in front of us said Colorado solution that will soon be a model across the country\nAnd they did it in a pretty surprising way they voted unanimously to get out of the redistricting\nIn who really wants to stand in front of their constituents and say I support the status quo where uh the partisans draw maps and where you voter are completely taken out of the equation\n[noise] and you mentioned earlier that you have no doubt that if this passes there will be political operatives were plotting to find some you know little way to get an edge do you see any vulnerabilities in the plant\n'em well if I did I'm not going to advertise to invite the operative\nGame the system but ah there's the old saying that if you build a better mouse trap them ice gets [noise]\nOkay so ... where it might not be willing to speculate about how somebody could steal the cheese from his proposed new were fancier mouse trap but I can [noise]\nTell me do it we're going to turn now to a mandated Gonzales she's the executive director of Colorado common cause nonpartisan group that supports\nEr access and trying to make government as representative as possible and it helped craft amendments y and Z\nSo for our conversation I'm going to be the sneaky political operative and look for ways to to gain a person that sounds good sounds good he looked like every\nPolitical operative I now really at all just tell you when I play monopoly like I'm ruthless hide money under the board I read the bank I on mortgage properties I make trades based on future incomes I'll take kickbacks like\nI'm not a political operative in another life may\nSo my big fat for how to cheat your is your system is to get\nThe right people on the commission people who are my people who I can trust or my interest in my party so walk me through it how how does this work\nOkay so we're trying to get to four four and four\nFour Democrats four Republicans four on a related voters correct twelve twelve people in our commission the first that is there is an application announced to all of Colorado anybody can fly so\nEven if you could fill your dream of being on a redistricting commission there are some requirements that you can't be a lobbyist or an elected official or have worked for a political party then you get a survivor random lottery\nBecause in California and they had\nOver thirty thousand applicants so we're just trying to ensure in case\nSomething like that how we get that much interest in Colorado that they're sort of manageable poor this was going to be like people you know signing up to go to Hamilton or something right high stakes after that\nPanel it's three retired judges then evaluate those pools for what's called initiated community criteria\nAre you part of your neighborhood association your PTA when we want people who live in a hot a whole I don't know anything about the state right next six of the commissioners would be a pointed at random the other six would be appointed by that same group of retired judges with some advice from legislative leaders\nAnd they're going to do that with a woman for the diversity in the states so that the commission hopefully looks pretty similar to the state of color [noise]\nOkay I I mean as these political operative here I mean\nIs this complicated just to like confused me that the purpose why am\nI going to say that we're trying to confuse you but we're definitely trying to work\nBecause they have to get through a couple of different stages of both random chance and nonpartisan selection it should be pretty difficult to hand picked someone\nThe this commission its its records would be open to the public right correct and the hearings will be open to the public they would and they have to be held throughout the state okay that sounds great for me because if it's a public hearing I could just get all my political operative buddies together and I could be like go pose as a member of the public go to this commission\nWhere would you place this moment that we're in the conversation that we're having as a country where do you place it in the arc of American history\nSo I guess there's two arcs where I Would situated one has to do with sexual equality and sexual violence and that's the one that everyone is talking about because it's just I mean the [noise]\nIt's just a viscerally in confronting us right whatever your views are about it or your personal experiences it's just an incredibly painful story right I mean I think everybody agrees the whole thing is quite painful and that because it's so visceral and so I think the media and personal from so many people\nAre men and women that it's hard to see it as anything but another chapter in kind of a culture war about sex and the long tale the sexual revolution\nBut the other lands that as a historian seems to me maybe structurally more important is the dramatic change in the process of Supreme Court confirmation so recall that the in the constitutional convention the president chose the\nSupreme Court nominee and at the last minute sort of Senate approval was added but the public isn't doesn't have a role in choosing the Supreme Court or the nominee now or the confirmation of the Supreme Court\nAnd in fact for most of the nineteenth century Supreme Court nominees never went to the committee is just it's the Senate just voted like you know the president made in set at a name in the Senate said yes it is and it's not until Nineteen twenty five at any nominee even appears before the committee like we think this is just an\nUnnecessary part of the process for some kind of constitutional requirement\nAnd the guy who prison I was just because he's actually suspected of crime [laughter] I next guy to appear in Nineteen thirty nine there rumors that he's a communist and so he comes before the committee says no I'm not a communist I've never been to Colombia\nAnd the only reason they call in because the last guy from Nineteen thirty seven it turned out he had been a member of the KKK and after he was affirmed people like it would've been good to bring him before the committee and asked me was remember the get get get so\nWhat we what are the sort of the limits like\nGuilty of a crime of member of the KKK a communist what what Kavanaugh stands accused of is our version of that right but it's still a weird thing that we all sit and watch the proceedings that doesn't start until Nineteen eighty seven with Robert Bork\nWhich I think is really better understood as the last of the Watergate hearings because Bork had been involved in the Nixon solicitor general [noise] but\nWhere we are now is\nRemember when uh Mitch McConnell said when he when a convened a hearing over the Merrick Garland nomination but he wouldn't do that because the American people had a right to choose the next Supreme Court justice because he was going to wait for the ... election right\nThat's just not true like that actually constitutionally is not how we choose our Supreme Court justice of the\nAmerican people do not choose the next Supreme Court justice but I mean it's totally reckless thing for him to have said it's just for the short term political\nGain he just didn't want to have you know he wanted to have a different I Want to have a conservative on on the court and he was willing to throw away anything any reasonable sense of fairness our procedure to do that\nAnd but you think about the ... of that and here with the cabinet proceeding and the kind of everybody watching it in the middle of their workday and tweeting about it it does is somehow in a de facto sense people believe that like by Twitter we should just decide who the Supreme\nCourt cases and I mean I suppose someone could say that's how we should do it but that is actually not what the the provision the separation of powers that uh the constitution dictates so we make a different decision but I I just think structurally terms of did you get your course like in the long arc of American history what is this about\nIt is actually about a very we sense that the Supreme Court\nIs answerable I just think we're going to be insulated from public opinion that's why they're lifetime appointments and they're not elected\nFinal\nQuestion what would you say to people what would you tell people who are are dismayed by the current Tanner and tone of politics or where they might feel history is going what would you would you tell them\nWhere I share that concern unreal alarm or in a number of places but one is\nBecause our partisanship has become automated so the deep polarized positions of the parties\nWere created manually by hand by political consultants and campaigns in the Nineteen seventies Nineteen eighties but starting in the Nineteen nineties with the opening of the Internet to commercial traffic and certainly in the first decade of the twenty first century with social media does that partisanship became fully automated so\nI think a lot of people would like a less polarized political conversation\nBut until we demand more of\nTinker with that machine\nWe won't get their\nThanks Jill Lepore and all of our destined to all of you for listening to

Tallahassee\nYeah so do you like whatever like can get through the crack to has you know I mean you see the light but he sees the thing that only has a crap that led to the light and ... you know the ... they always had the duality of everything is I think what I'm trying to say I'm so\nOh yeah I I I remember him dancing so beautifully around these kinds of questions which I think he uh was irritated by [laughter] AmeriCorps and when I say that I don't mean to be disparaging of the person I'm constructing the questions\nI think it's natural for us to be curious and to articulate our concerns or thoughts are questions\nBut I think it's also natural for the quote unquote artists to\nPreserve the kind of mystery and to not talk about the mechanics almost like a porno you know this goes in here that goes in there there's something bigger than the mechanics and that is the end the end result the stirring quality of of what is the result\nOf an artist at work\nAnd um you know I think he uh\nHas he said you know I put my paper had on my concussion and dance he tried to hunt for the occasions to to dance around questions or a cooperate Tibet as best he could and I feel like such a shabby imposter trying to\nBe the ... for him you know the ambassador of this particular book which I had very little to do with frankly others and\nOffering a title for it or he wrote a very eloquent\nIntroduction which I Will be quoting as time goes on here [laughter]\nThank you so I ... I think you've said he left behind like lockers worth of notebooks what are you dealing with them I mean you ... like he was always riding there's always a cocktail napkins and pages and\nIn his pocket you found a notebook in the freezer ones um so what what are you dealing with the findings\nWell it's amazing there's so much paperwork to go through a from the simplest point of view is the ... the archival work which is assembling everything and trying to pay homage to it for posterity\nThen there's a the completion of works of his in this instance it's the flame this book um and then there were also some songs which I was tasked with finishing you know you may know I have produced his last record the\nCold you want a darker and while working with him many many poems were red sometimes to a mere kicked Trump you know just from meter per tempo and so there's this sense of responsibility to keep the songs alive is he always used to say\nI Want to play the title song on the final album that was released when your father line at Khan was still alive it's called you on a darker and then we'll talk about working with him on hand and this is it's what can I say it's a great song [noise]\nIf you she means I'm running for scientists to [noise] because if you want us to talk [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAh [noise]\nIn the human frame [noise]\nMillion candles and burning for another game\nYou want to Darren [noise]\n\n\n\nAs Leonard calling from the final album that was released while he was alive the title track\nYou want a darker I guess that's your son Adam ... who wrote the introduction to a new collection of ... final palms notebook entries lyrics and drawings called the flame\nThat China so much about facing death and of having a God who allows suffering and accepting the suffering but yet not being like happy about it or trying to make it seem like sufferings great [laughter] you know you're not trying to be\nSpiritual and dismissive way of of all the suffering that we indoor\n[noise] um I I Want to read what he wrote about you for the liner notes of this album he wrote that without your\nContribution there would be no record he said at a certain point after over a year of intense labor both pat\nWho wrote the melodies and I went to Natalie broke down with severe back injuries and other disagreeable visitations in my case the situation was bleak the discomfort cute and the project was abandoned Adam sense that my recovery if not my survival\nDepended on my getting back to work he took over the project establish me in a medical charity kissing and brought these unfinished songs to completion preserving of course many pets hunting musical themes\nAnd it's because of my sons loving encouragement\nSkilled administration that the sun's exist in their present form I cannot think enough what were you able to do for him physically to make it possible for him to record the album he mentions you put him in a medical ... can you describe the sad about that that you helped create for him I think\nMaybe the more interesting things certainly to me would be to to just say that\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind and the grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire mission and of course it has to do with a serious health issues he was a mobilized\nYou had multiple compression fractures of his spine and it involved an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last to help them but in this book and in general [noise] he he invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become ... acts there to sell jacks because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalogue\nAnd and their regurgitate in thanks whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons final ... homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and\nAdam Cohen wrote the introduction to it and they take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air Mm\n[noise]\nColorado Public radio is supported by active members including network partners thank you too Ira ... than Atlantic even and Kendra black for sustaining index programming throughout Colorado learned about giving levels under the ... CPR dot org\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could\nUrge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it picks up a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work\nWhat why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version short\n[laughter] this is Leonard come yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right you got to be friends Gretchen yet yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something or you know where you're give give some other songs a chance to get played um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has on hello yeah I think I think we'll play in any way you okay with that\nOh God you know I'm going to report due to the bully believe [laughter] okay I hear it\n[noise]\n\n\nReally [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThat's ... singing hallelujah and my guess is when it comes on Adam cone and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead published Leonard clone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until Jack Buckley recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it and which is just so strange\nBut um it just sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius wasn't fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit for that\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did he had been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI I Know that he was not satisfied\nOr he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role was the father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this shabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more ... surprising and delicious you know this unexpected\nAbility to to fill you know twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and uh\nTo see him take his hat off you know and I think we jubilant audiences one after the other which the man who was genuinely surprised\nJust and delighted by the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late\nTo thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what year it was it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and she sings a larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as a benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoy your solitude and I thought like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone enjoy your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs find you and your solitude yeah and so I made a blood ... actually the the exact quote is made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful\nWell this is a man who as he says and I think you've you've just played it well you know although we had a reputation

the time you were born Suzanne selling Marion hey that's no way to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear them all he\nDid he didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about\nSongs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I I was a five year old uh on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe maybe I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said he was scrap you record that's an amateur move\nAnd you know catch when I thought about that are basically\nTelling the story of the blues this music where you'd have people with nothing or are close to nothing looking to music within themselves when times are their toughest\nWell I I Know for me that in my darkest hour there's always been a song that has helped me to transcend and certainly the story of country music and the story of the blues which are really wanting the same\nThe story of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people looking for that boat across dark waters\nYou chose to make your characters African American in the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision\nMade when I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee just sent a woman named Lorraine she had a pet crow when she was a kid on her dad's form and this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm they'd find a\nBits of string or or cellophane or tinfoil so in my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time to get this book finished um but really the big part of the time was getting it published and ah and then finding an illustrator and it wasn't until maybe four years passed before the publisher said sorry catch we can't really find the right illustrator would you like to search\nAnd I found on the listing of a local art college Higgins bond here in Nashville Higgins is a really important children's illustrator in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and then stops working for a long time\nHiggins is the reason that Lorraine is African American because Higgins is African American in fact she's the first African American woman to design a U.S postage stamp\nI was talking to the actress Viola Davis recently about a children's book that she's done she was saying two things one is there is an incredible need for characters of color in children's books it's been a void that's existed for very long time\nShe also says she loves when you have say characters of color but there doesn't have to be some explanation or reason for it what do you think of is that something we're seeing in your book yes\nAnd the thing that was missing and really waited until I discovered Higgins bond\nIs that I I really wanted Lorraine to be an African American girl you know I I Do a lot of volunteer work around communities of color and in one of the places where I'm often reading literacy and and mentorship program for kids\nI'll read any number of books with this book I have the opportunity to now read a story in which the characters looked like the audience\nI'm interested in your volunteering and and I know you also helped found a private school in Nashville right I mean it it sounds like your commitment to education as part of where the terms were came from yeah they all sort of come around the\nSame forces to draw up for me this passion about education as a kid I Lived in all these different towns five pounds by the fifth grade my parents were educators\nSo it turned out that I had it in me to start a school and then these kind of volunteer gigs really helped me to say oh I'm I think I could see a school in the parking lot by the shores of this rushing interstate with the two\nExpressway spurs and the the shoney's in the wake shop that parking lot's got to school growing in it we just need to plant the seeds\nIs that where you put the school was it by wakes up in his ...\nYeah that's what I thought what better place to put the newest Episcopal school in the nation\n[laughter] I Love it was this a different experience reading a book compared to writing son I think\nWriting songs and writing a children's book are really kind of one in the same you want to get a tagline or a refrain you want to have language that's easy to remember there's a sing song quality to this book it's in ...\nIt makes me want to ask you and I don't know if you'd be comfortable or not but if would you sing a page of the book like even the ending if if that's something I don't know if you've you've thought about putting it to music\nI'd love to I hadn't [noise] let's see what should our melody be I'm going to leave it up to you know

use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defying the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story this year's\nConfrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill weeds it told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and cotton they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that ... could create such an issue bring so many farmers against farmers\nDecamp didn't stay where it belonged to drifted across the landscape been injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\nTrespassing known your neighbor and your friend that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board asked the most dramatic limits on dot camera in the whole country no die campus spraying during the growing season this summer I called Terry fuller back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year ... just been a sad situation and all you know really an unbelievable situations\nThe planned boards investigators try to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation I talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive\nA couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way and by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules\nUntil recently the head of Interpol the international police organization based in France was a man named among Hong way he's from China\nBut in a stunning move China's government detained

version of Google Plus it's social network but some saws have answered a Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March\nBut the company decided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiked the morning so can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year uh people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could've been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected ... number is abuser is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches fog just did or didn't do\nRight I mean they didn't go public and let people know that that their privacy might have been at risk why\nYeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent they found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nForward with this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the face but Cambridge Analytica data breaches just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nOf Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation and a bigger way we'll have they responded\nTo your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took it pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones for things like ... there are there are a lot of\nDifferent apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationships with developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this was at\nA situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google that care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust 'em it in this situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people and in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you know can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined colleagues in writing the story he was working with fellow reporter rubber McMillan

because\nPolitics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we have a very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable\nTo talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders who might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful of that that\nIt also at some level is a diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree\nWith the boss politically that's going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from most people around them that people are assuming that they

coworker we're talking about a candidate at all the time who you found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office preventing them\nAnd they act the way that you thought of that person may

like\nThey're going to talk about their flight to be like and buy stuff ... and ... minutes a woman that identified individual who walks into the room and get their presentation and then as soon as they leave the room there would be you know side chatter comments about the prisoners looks or something along those lines\nBut boys will be boys won't say what do you what are you say to people who who react that way\nI think if a chuckle initially just 'cause I think it's it's so foolish to say and believe that um 'cause you know boy you shouldn't\nDo we ... we wouldn't react we wouldn't react radio friendly I don't yeah [laughter] ah [laughter] and that's why we're struggling with the words here like we laugh initially because it's crap yeah\nI Wonder William if after being involved in men in the movement if you've looked at your past behavior inside you know I was a jerk when I did that\nReally um and that's definitely part of the process I think got called touched on too with a building helping nationalities um a lot of that and if a process is taking a look back to what I was doing when I was not aware of these issues was doing when I was ignorant to a lot of the harm out is creating that was a specific\nYeah so when I first came to college I was very involved in the frat culture for that yeah I Would go to parties on what the goals like trying to pick up a woman\nOr try to advance sexually with an individual and that would be the entire golden me going out and that night and they would often also involved alcohol and underage drinking and so taking a step back and looking now you know what when my intentions why were my taxes that way who are the people around me helping me continue\nThat thought process and what I was trying to do and who are also involved in doing similar things and allows it problematic what harm could have been caused a harmless caused\nAnd I suppose the fundamentally you're not saying that there's anything wrong with the desire to hook up I mean I think that's a very natural thing but I I think you point to the alcohol there I think you point to the kind of peer pressure that might be driving that desire into something that could become harmful is that what I'm hearing from you\nYeah exactly there's always an effort to get you know women\nTo drink can I get you a drink and I I'm just have like show women wear that hard alcohol is right away and an effort to loosen them up or um it's really just coercion into most often times turning the initial rejection into a yes and that's the way a lot of men had been ties you know if you get told no initially\nKeep trying you know no it doesn't mean now that means try harder it means what else can I Do to make this no turn into a yes\nOr more people joining men in the movement it's yes you in this environment\nUm it's been about the same for about five years and my\nGuess in terms of what the barriers for more men to come in is that there are many many men who are good guard tons of men who don't\nLike the un his objects or had sexually assaulted anyone of their lives there's\nWay more of those kinds of men than there are men who had perpetrate a sexual assault and I think the barrier is that they think that that's good enough\nAnd won't go that extra step to actually work against what is happening right so the problem is that that maintains a status quo so we need more men to like take that extra step to engage in a conversation opposed to just saying you know I I Am a good guy I don't actually that's all people I'm good\nI Want to have you respond to what the president has said about this being a very scary time for young men statistics show that the prevalence of false reporting on sexual assault is between about two and ten percent is this a scary time for young men\nI think it's scary for a certain type of dude I have confidence that my guys are scared because they're not going to rape they understand what consent means and how it works and so\nIt's interesting to parse out the type of man who is scared I miss time and to me it's hard to think that it's not a good thing because if you're scared and maybe it'll be more careful about your actions\nYou know such as typically as you said that the false reports of sexual or like so so low and jumping the other people I just have made it seem that hundreds of thousands of men are being falsely accused like every second of every day\nGentlemen I Want to thank you for your time there and give thanks for having us\nCarl Olson leads men in the movement is Colorado State university

regulators in Arkansas have banned the use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defined the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by Bayer rolled out a new way to kill weeds it told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and cotton they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that ... could create such an issue brings so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged to drifted across the landscape been injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\n... known your neighbor in your free and that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board asked the most dramatic limits on campus in the whole country no die campus spring during the growing season this summer I called Terry full or back to see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year scripts liquor is just been sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant boards investigators try to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation I talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive\nA couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way and by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules like tad now\nPersonally I don't believe in spraying dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new dot camera tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop ... says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up die can bud blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people and find and I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to keep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's sprayed\nThat legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't get injured and then he'd be tempted\nTo spray dicamba to\nDan Charles NPR News [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nCPR news and MORNING EDITION and we will meet the candidates for

morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some saws at the answer to Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company\nDecided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiker morning so can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data the number to potentially affected ... number is of user is small it's only about\nPotentially half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did when did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed or didn't do\nRight I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that that there are privacy might have been at risk why\nYeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apt to some extent they found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play\nWhich was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nA forwarded this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the face but Cambridge Analytica data breaches just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny of Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation in a bigger way ...\nWhat have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took a pretty drastic step which is a ... you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big steps they're also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like gee now there are there are a lot of\nDifferent apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationships of developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent a situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google that care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision these you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal he joined colleagues in writing a story

overdue change fish scale is friendship too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back towards the center\nAlaska as some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large new mines and oil developments in the works if it passes Alaska when an act a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat\nAmong other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon streams if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties would acknowledge is that in a state like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this it's really kind of\nSome in your nose at the big guys you know\nFor decades Alaska's economy has\nDepended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of ads like this layer\nIt claims to protect fish habitat but it actually improved his burn some new regulations that slow or stop Alaska projects\nCompanies have poured millions into the campaign against the ballot measure\nWith help from donors like BP and Exxon Mobil they'd know raised more money than all three of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined turned Matthias is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far coal existed with minds that oil developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems crazy\nBut I just thinks the initiative prioritizes standing at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers\nWe couldn't have the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans similar more than just a living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their vital food source in a traditional way of life in one of

thanks for weighing in here Hi David thanks for having me we talked\nTo some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because\nPolitics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we're very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable to talk politics in some officers in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders he might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your co workers that are just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful it out that\nIt also at some level is a diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree\nWith the boss politically that is going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from those people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drying them into conversations sort of making them feel complicit and he points that they find pretty harmful or offensive lard\nThese days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court nomination hearings I've been going on and even if someone is\nResolved I'm not going to talk about this at work regardless of what side of that particular\nIssue one is you can imagine someone looking at the TV and saying\nOh you know one way or another and it's a little hard to suppress all of one's reactions\nI think it can be useful to to think that it from the other side if your coworker we're talking about a candidate at all the time who you found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office promoting them and they act the way that you thought of that person it may impact the relationship in subtle ways\nAnd there's no reason
