Bern on September fourteenth so not even a month ago as floodwaters from Florence swamped his city\nWe've had twelve hundred nine one one request on the last twelve hours that's very unusual\nAnd we have called mayor outlaw back to ask about how the cleanup effort is gone and how they're bracing for this next hurricane mirror outlaw good to have you with us\nThank you um we have a still a lot of debris down we picked up about thirty five percent what we're trying to do right now is just stabilize the debris that we have not picked up so that in the event of a twenty to forty miles per hour when that this uh debris material will stay put and not scattered\nBut let me let me back you up because when we talk to you not quite four weeks ago a with Florence you um had\nAsked people to evacuate you actually were telling us about firefighters out on fire trucks telling people to you know leave get some more safe how about this time are you looking to evacuate or telling people to stay safe stay put\nWorld stand by we have an emergency operations center that we have not activated we have forty one trucks\nPicking up debris as quickly as we can we have nine cities and towns across the state that are helping us for that effort we just ah yeah we're all prayer for our friends down in Florida Georgia South Carolina was that this thing will not be anything like the impact that we had four or five hours was a storm surge and\nThis appears to be more of a of a ... when\nThere is anything on the weekend by the time it hits it hits you we hope you when\nYou say you've got people are picking up to ... you're talking about\nBrief still left from Hurricane Florence are you talking about stuff that's just come down newly since then was went\nWell what's kind of like in phases we uh the initial debris from the shock of of what happened and and now folks are are getting in getting the escalation out from underneath their home yeah they're finding out that their heat pumps and HVAC systems have been compromised the duct work\nAnd so are you know sheet rock and and all the components of the home or you know we just uh after careful inspection by our respective department and many as ... as we found that there's a lot more detailed or what has to be done them than what we initially thought\nYou've still got a lot of buildings their houses businesses et cetera with with ... for ... after Hurricane Florence is that right\nWhat we still have seven hundred homes of twenty two thousand\nThat we cannot re power book called the electric components were were compromised during the storm event and we're working as hard as we can with the owners to get licensed contractors electrical contractors to come in and correct those problems so we can re power the home\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of the craven county schools that had been shot since Hurricane Florence we're set to reopen this week did that\nUm some of them

uh we're we're continuing to to put our city back together\nThis must just feel like adding insult to injury to have another big storm headed your way\nOh yeah but you know if you looked at thirty percent of the population United States lives within fifty miles because they love it we love it is the quality of life that that doesn't get any better and\nYeah we just really can't think America

Dana outlaw of New Bern North Carolina we wish you good luck and stay safe thanks so much\n[noise]\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about the exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey Jon Kyl so so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contribute and let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks most valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand is that usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so there's concern\nThe markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe his cool to bed as\nHave emerging markets and the IMF\nGave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by it\nTo sell off but virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today of wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value to a day\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a third percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech and very tough day but is this just the beginning of along down there trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said that selling toward the end of the day which took the dog down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy in the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take somebody off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberate should not what'd you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nElite came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patients to health as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the ... a B C D E F bundle\nThat bundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause delirious patients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator\nF is for family engagement us as these all reduce the amount of time patients spend delirious and that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that eat part is cut in half so these things are all intersecting as he is\n... bed ... explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again a little bit here and\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered to ... by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey had been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge factor Kirk Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into\nWe're talking about a a cultural change so we have to buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by an event you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and they only do rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistant to using the a throughout the checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F is the exception\nIt was even a challenge to make it routine\nAt Vanderbilt like a ... and I can't be Joanna starlings or clinical pharmacist as he ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThat needs to many cat were nice to be here and racing or gay in San ... helped me kinda ... projects really empower the American dream than than makes it happening every ad\nWest elites crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend in expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they're getting better care surviving more often with a more attacks brain and not bouncing back to the ice you always see some financial benefit to me that too when\nRichard Harris NPR News\nPeople along the Florida Panhandle are hunkering down as hurricane Michael tears through will have full coverage of the storms here

complains has not been disclosed but the D.C court kicked the allegations up to chief justice Roberts for a referral to another circuit Roberts then sent them to the tenth circuit in Colorado which theoretically could now launched an investigation but experts say that's highly unlikely\nAnd without it we were struggling I Would think that it'd be very paused email fifty percent almost what we

things that it opened up basically Mexico is pretty much the same it was as NAFTA we've got a few provisions that are change but the getting eighty and one was the one that it changed\nAnd so the

calling with China we've got a new problem so and so it's time for some stability\nWith Don brown who's Colorado's agriculture commissioner and she joins us from his farm in ...\nOther auto sunburn let's step back and ask some big picture questions here or we know that this is an arid state overall we know that in the face of climate change a droughts are likely to get worse uh are farmers\nQuestioning what they grow here are they looking more broadly at the question of climate change and whether the the state and they find themselves in with precipitation right now is just a a new permanent state of affairs\n[noise] climate change a in a mini farm is just a farmer's way of life and uh the climate is never the same\nAny two years in a row it varies farmers farm within the norm of what they considered it a norm is is that norm shift shift a shift stored list precipitation over a longer period of time\nThey will shift with it they're used to shifting I mean they constantly play for the average uh far as weather goes that's typically what they're used to doing\nSo consequently although we're seeing climate change they will leave all they will grow to different crops maybe they'll move from on dry land particularly moved from driving corn grain sorghum cars a little less moisture\nMaybe they'll plant different varieties of wheat that require a little less moisture they will evolve with that uh that spin a way of life for agriculture ever since it first existed\n[noise] are there highlights is is there some promise right now in agriculture in Colorado\n[noise] oh I think there's always promise and uh you know I'm we're talking pretty doom and gloom here but I always say there's opportunities one can shift their business model slightly\nA marketing maybe doing a little better job of marketing digging a operated take an opportunity to markets running to maybe a\nForward contracts um commodities uh no I'm I'm not a doom and gloom God all I'm an optimist you have to be when you put a little bitty seat in the ground and expect it to generate a lot more seed\nThen you put in I mean so you you you know I I don't think that the doom and

Spicer peppers but long green peppers ... uh people rose and then turn into all sorts of numbers of things so historically the the ... you know a\nA producer has been in Mexico and specifically the ... valley of southern New Mexico the town that calls itself the chili capital of the world is hatched so that will they have about a you know they have a far they have more decades\nPromoting their specific chilies in Colorado that\nIs just a question of promotion I mean what affects the the the vast difference in production\nAnd again it's interesting because she only has that been grown in Mexico for about\n... she's more than two hundred years in Colorado they've probably been grown for let's say about a hundred years but in terms of promotion New Mexico has the advantage going back decades as a hatch growers they've been promoting their chilies and hatch\nJeeze going back to the Nineteen seventies and they really finally hit the mainstream outside of the American southwest\nMaybe about Fifteen Years ago in Colorado and the story I did for NPR's assault their food blog or the ... the ... what do they call themselves apply blow chili grows associations in other words the group of\nFarmers in Pueblo that got together to promote their chili they only got together and twin Fifteen that's only three years ago so even though the chilies been grown in southern Colorado ... century the farmers finally realized like oh wow maybe\nYeah maybe this thing can hit outside of southern Colorado are okay\nSo it's a question of perhaps time and investment is it a question and all of industrialization like I Wonder if the processes are different in New Mexico that allow for that much larger coal\nAgain I mean and it's funny ah you have the agricultural commission on right commissioner on right before me a book to be able\nTo answer that question better but I mean from what I Know and talking to farmers in Colorado are you know the chili farmers in southern Colorado it was just never a thing and what I mean by a thing was that the people down in southern Colorado they knew about the ... so they would only go\nGrowth for the people who knew it ... never had any ambition of trying to grow for market outside of southern Colorado now and in a part of it was just to me that sell itself it was bread it was a very delicate fragile chili\nThat you had a scientist with a Colorado State named Michael bart solo\nAbout how I was twenty five years ago we started trying to breed better Chile or improve it that that's that's what they that's a term in horticulture and then about ten years ago he they viewed it improved a meta so Chile called\nTo mediate climate change is that it will be an economic hardship or that you are hitting industries oil and gas among them that many people in Colorado are connected to uh negatively\nUh and that the economy's might in fact shrink ... say say just a bit more what you mean when you say this can be profitable\n[noise] Xcel Energy recently lost by about a year ago put out an all sources solicitation for who could supply them electricity\nAt what price from any source they got no bid for fossil sources of new power less than four cents a kilowatt hour\nWind was a little on a little under two cents solar was a little over two cents whim plus solar plus storage batteries was three cents\nActually let assume that natural gas would be the winner\nOur governor has been positioning the state to be a natural gas state they were gobs smacked renewable energy is cheaper than fossil energy and so when citizens put solar on their homes their electricity bills go down\nI have a solar on my ranch in twenty Thirteen when the floods happened in power was out for the better part of a week not at my house I called my neighbors said you ought to come charge your cell phones are put stuff in the freezer\nIt is more secure it builds community and there are now more jobs in Colorado from renewable energy clean energy energy efficiency than from all of the extractive industries oil gas coal uranium those jobs are declining\nFracking the uh people are saying oh don't vote for a proposition on twelve it'll cut jobs those jobs are dying anyway that industry is badly in debt over leverage and we'll go away\nWhy I Wonder how liberal economy we should be investing\nIn what will solve climate change and again it's cheaper once you put up the wind and solar it's free the fuel is free what part of free don't you understand\nYou say it's cheaper how much of that is because of subsidies\nAll in all energy is subsidized globally we spend five trillion dollars actually I Believe it's five point three\nEvery year subsidizing fossil energy that's ten billion dollars in it\nAnd that comes out of your in my tax dollars for citizens around the world all of the renewable subsidies put together are far less than what we continue to subsidize to fossil energy so I'm a free marketeers let's get rid of all subsidies\nLet all these technologies compete on their merits and you will not hear the oil and gas boys saying that because they cannot exist without those subsidies\nHunter lemons of the Colorado carbon fund and natural capital solutions what is carbon farming help us understand that as a potential way of uh I guess it sequestering carbon\n[noise] it is when you farm or ranch regenerative lovely using what's called holistic management you're taking carbon out of the air and putting it back in the soil one of the best examples and if you want a good video on this\nGabe brown keys to building a healthy soil\nGave was up north Dakota corn and soybean farmer struggling because he was struggling he went first to know till he stopped breaking the soil God who break the soil turned it upside down\nThe carbon escapes he then went to planting cover crops many of them deep rooted\nThat takes carbon deep into the soil\nHe them introduced animals cattle goats sheep pigs the animal impact the disturbance on the ground for a short period of time to eat everything and then you move them to a new pasture using electric fences\nThat action is what put the ten feet of thick black soil but the pioneers found when they came across the great plains it put that black which is carbon deep into the soil\nDeb has gone on some of his tax from a little over one

regenerative agriculture regenerative grazing\nYou can go on a savory Institute website and find reams of evidence all the scientific studies showing that we can roll climate\nChange backward ... literally have carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the ground to help I realize that's probably a naive question but help help listeners understand just briefly this the science of that or is it simply that you are not releasing carbon that would otherwise be really you\nKnow it's as you said it to begin with you are taking carbon out of the air it's called photosynthesis grass has fourteen times the carbon per weight of the tree the world's grasslands are the world's second largest carbon sink carbon still on storage\nAfter the oceans and yet we've been ... grasslands we can ... them by grazing the way that grasslands co evolved with grazing animals\nOn the great plains herds of vice and more densely packed because there were wolves if a wolf wants to eat you the safe place to be in the middle of the herd\nSo they're all trying to get to the middle of their plump up they eat everything and then they move on meanwhile they fertilize the ground their hooves of chop it up they don't come back until the grass has read grown but that action of fertilizing it of\nImpacting the grass drives carbon deep into the biological community in the soil particularly the Michael rise a fun guy and I know this is sounding a bit ...\nWell no and again\nTo the gate brown video and gave walks through exactly what he did and why it's making him now wildly profitable there

to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which were owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states\nEighteen forty six he sat American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans the Mexicans fought back and poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it\nTo I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between us and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say\nWe need a big war with Mexico but wait a minute here he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nManatees Sen sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why are we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted in the future\nOkay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go ahead a century\nTo around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president the United states what happened to Nineteen fifty\nI Love Truman Steve but he did this terrible thing in Nineteen fifty the north Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and what Truman should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said\nI had like a war declaration they would have given up to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized and that might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so trauma didn't even bother to go into Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said dream and didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of the constitution\nWhat are some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states in World War that is popular your poll ratings were arrives\nYou write early in this book\nWhere the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and should grand to discover that in spite of their ardent striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happened to\nGet that job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president addicted to President Obama would do that that it doesn't even nobody makes the connection between war and politics but the founders never wanted to see a president make the other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is mark remarked on the fact that\nOftentimes if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that is a thought that our founders would never wanted\nTo hear from any president one of the recent episode I Want to ask about presidents Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of this average today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation\nSpecifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress it's seen as a serious mistake and foreign policy had left the Charlotte\nBut Syria was much more freedom what'd you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake I figured it was always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless you've got Congress in with him on

possibility of tornadoes wins will be ...\nSixty miles an hour nothing like what you saw in Florida but it left to do damage you're\nConsidering that this is already a totally\nWater logged region very extensive flooding here in the lumber to the area and across North Carolina Hurricane Florence many many homes were severely damaged I was driving around last night the number of of homes that are still a without a a an an occupied without 'cause they're not being able to\nBe inhabited the damage um they're going to really have a hard time recovering from this much harder than they would have otherwise right\nAnd as you note that background as water a lot of there's nowhere really for that X terrain to go and\nYou know Rachel schools here have been closed since September eleventh\nAnd I they have not reopened I spoke to the superintendent yesterday she told me she had hoped to have the schools open today but yesterday she shut out a notice to parents this that schools are going to be closed at least until next Monday This is now in this week of no school then Harris are going nuts\nAnd NPR's Tom Gjelten reporting from Lumberton North Carolina I think Tom you've been with us now Ken Graham he's the director of the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane center he joins me from Miami, Florida where he's been tracking all that can't get morning\nGood morning ritual what can you tell us about the conditions on Florida's Gulf Coast right now\nYou know just a a devastating hurricane real historic I mean since Eighteen fifty one our records don't show\nA category for making landfall the Florida Panhandle so a historic storm catastrophic damage you know you just have the the winds associated with such a strong storm\nBut not only that you have a storm surge I mean we you know predicting the potential to nine to fourteen feet of inundation in some areas and that says that's destructive to end the waves are even on top of that so the combination of the rain the whims of the storm surge has had every aspect of all the the impacts we expect from a strong hurricane\nRight until you mentioned the storm surge I mean are they are active threats right now to the people who didn't evacuate too who are still in the areas that were hardest hit\nRacial what happens is all that water is forced and because of the winter so strong with the hurricane and\nYou know we were we were talking about this the last three days and how far inland some of that storm surge does it find every every low spots so rivers that normally flow 'em out to the Gulf like the apple after caller river they float they actually reverse the water goes back or to go\nTen Fifteen miles inland so once it's forced in with the wind now it has to flow out and that takes time so those water levels gonna stay hard for a little while\nI'm this storm moved quicker than Hurricane Florence any part of the the devastation that term is that it was so slow moving um but this one it seemed to come on so fast why was that\nIt it's interesting to look at these hurricanes because they're all so different and that's why we try to we spend so much time here at the hurricane center and and talking about those impacts because they're all completely different so foreign stalls and like a Harvey right in Texas and you get a Florence that when they ... they could bring\nAn amazing amount of rain flooding dangerous life threatening rain but this one was fast so a different impact with a fast one is you know you start getting some of those hurricane force inland we had a hurricane in southwest Georgia last night which is which is staggering and that and that causes a lot of damage as well the other part of this\nEquation is interesting too and you have a Florence\nAnd and you have storms that come across the Atlantic you can see 'em for five six seven days right when they when this time of your typical for October when they form in the Caribbean there's just not a lot of real estate\nSo once once they form and they start moving especially with Michael moving you know during the life cycle anywhere from twelve to Fifteen miles an hour to get your quick so those timelines change based on where they form\nAnd you don't have a lot of time to prepare are not as much as we mentioned the thing is is not over it's been downgraded to a tropical storm but it's headed toward the Carolinas um how much in the tightest opposed to cities don't it\nYou know look look at the radar here you know we're still have a a strong circulation around it we're still think of as we're still a tropical storm and even after all this time fifty mile an hour winds around the core so around those rain bands that you can definitely still get heavy rain flooding rain you can get tornadoes in those rain bands and the other part that always worries me\nIs you know the falling trees as well because once you've saturated fats soil and we're still talking fifty him on our Web that'll knock down trees and power lines so yeah the dangerous start over people still have to really watch Michael as we we move across the Carolinas\nAll right Ken Graham he's the

know it's hard to coordinate any of that if you can't even talk to first responders and the other people who can help you\nI wholeheartedly agree that's why I'm communicating with you because radio waves have not been stopped I can listen to you on the radio and if my um contact with Gulf Power Sandy Sam's happens to hear somebody like that happens here maybe they can find a way of communicating with me\nWow I'm so ... it's my understanding you have been driving around this morning can you just give us a sense of what you have seen\nAgain I I Am I'm isolated to my my jurisdiction which is Panama City beach Panama City beach actually they're very very well in you know in light of what what hit us mhm um I Will tell you that almost every condo and every hotel is\nIs fine um we lost signage we lost our lines uh we lost some shingles in houses I I drove by my house on the close to the bay earlier or late yesterday and I lost all the trees and all the fence in the house is fine there's just no power\nBut as soon as you cross another half mile to the east you can see where all the tornado paths where\nAnd um it's it's devastating I I spoke to my um police chief just seven minutes ago and he said that on twenty third street which is the main commercial drive through Panama City they literally ran a bulldozer down the road declared the debris\nHuh well we hope your message gets out there um we'll people are listening now Mario ... is the sitting senator of Panama City beach thank you so much for your time this morning\nThank you with us now Ken Graham he's the director of the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane center he joins me from Miami, Florida where he's been tracking all that came to morning\nGood morning ritual what can you tell us about the conditions on Florida's Gulf Coast right now\nYou know just a a devastating hurricane on you know real historic I mean since Eighteen fifty one our records don't show a category for making landfall the Florida Panhandle ... historic storm catastrophic damage you know you just have the the winds associated with such a strong storm\nBut not only that you have a storm surge I mean we you know predicting the potential to nine to fourteen feet of inundation in some areas and that says that's destructive to end the waves are even on top of that so the combination of the rain the when the storm surge has had every aspect of all the the impacts we expect from a strong hurricane\nRight until you mentioned the storm surge I mean are they are active threats right now to the people who didn't evacuate too who are still in the areas that were hardest hit\nRacial what happens is all that water is forced an because the winds were so strong with the hurricane and you know we were we were talking about this the last three days and how far\nInland some of that storm surge does it find every every low spots so rivers that normally flow 'em out to the Gulf like the apple after caller river they float they've actually reverse that water goes backwards or can you do\nTen Fifteen miles inland so once it's forced in with the wind now it has to flow out and that takes time so those water levels gonna stay high for a little while\nI'm that this storm moved quicker than Hurricane Florence any part of the the devastation that sermon that it was so slow moving um but this one it seemed to come on so fast why was that\nYou know it's interesting to look at these hurricanes because they're all so different and that's why we try to we spend so much time here at the hurricane center and and talking about those impacts because they're all completely different so foreign stalls\nAnd like a Harvey right in Texas and you're going to Florence that when they ... they could bring\nAn amazing amount of rain flooding dangerous life threatening rain but this one was fast so a different impact with a fast one is you know you start getting some of those hurricane force inland we had a hurricane in southwest Georgia last night which is which is staggering and that and that causes a lot of damage as well the other part of this\nEquation is interesting too and you have a Florence\nAnd and you have storms that come across the Atlantic you can see 'em for five six seven days when they when this time of year typical for October when they form in the Caribbean there's just not a lot of real estate\nSo one once they form and they start moving especially with Michael moving you know during the life cycle anywhere from twelve to Fifteen miles an hour to get here quick so those timelines change based on where they form\nYou don't have a lot of time to prepare are not as much as we mentioned this thing is is not over it's been downgraded to a tropical storm but it's headed toward the Carolinas um how much of a typist opposed to city still in it\nYou know looking at the radar here you know we're still have a a strong circulation around it we're still think of them were still a tropical storm and even after all this time fifty on our wins around the core\nSo around those rain bans you can definitely still get heavy rain flooding rain you can get tornadoes in those rain bands and the other part that always worries me is you know the falling trees as well because once you've saturated that soil and we're still talking fifty him on our Web that'll knock down trees and power lines so you have the dangerous storm out over people still have to really watch Michael is we we\nWe're off the Carolinas All right Ken ground is the director of the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane center we reached him from Miami, Florida Ken thanks so much we appreciate it you broke\nGerman Chancellor uncle of Merkel's

I'm rebuilding them you know we don't know how long that's going to take and I'm actually surprised the crew got him there because we're hearing word of difficulty is from other cruise trying to get into the area that cannot\nA major arteries are still impassable I tennis shut down all the way through almost to the Alabama line so trying to get even out to that area is a challenge right now and a lot of people can't send in fact in Bay county they're telling people to stay away yeah\nThe largest hospitals in Panama City are shutting down look what's being said about I mean people are just picking themselves up at this point but\nThe strength of this storm and how quickly it went from a category two to four oh we've been told in part of the warming waters um but we know what people there saying ... there's no time in history where we can more accurately predict and yet this came up so fast\nIt came up really fast but what's interesting about this storm is actually the prediction forecast for where it was going to head\nHeld relatively true I'm this we should say\nThis was about two miles per hour short of making landfall as a category five storm it's when we're extremely heavy um we're anticipating a category three I woke up a went Tuesday Morning Wednesday morning and they said it was a cat for it and I felt my stomach just kind of return\nUm the most of the area has ever since the end is a category three so seeing that store and become a category for it and that's an incredibly powerful categories of four I think there was a National Weather service called it\nUnprecedented and we had local emergency management officials telling us that it was the most powerful storm this region has ever seen since Eighteen fifty one which is before they even gave storm names\nSo you know this is not the ... this was not a regular weather event to learn the panhandle\nLook we've actually coming to visit you in a couple of weeks ahead of the midterms and we're still going to do that\nAnd looking forward to it a slightly different reporting but this comes in this political time Republican governor Rick Scott running for Senate seat against the incumbent Bill Nelson\nTallahassee democratic mayor Andrew Gillum isn't a tight race for governor with a Republican Congress and gone to Santas um today a federal judge rejected a Democratic Party pushed to extend Florida's voter registration deadline because\nOf hurricane Michael but just in a few seconds we have this hurricane can shape politics depending on how it's a you know handled by the lawmakers storms are political\nGillum a came in under heavy criticism um for the low power restoration two years ago after hurricane\nHer mean and you actually saw a lot of that might be going on back and forth even with the storm um get to Santas was up with ads\nIn several of our panhandle markets and he's been heavily criticized for not pulling those ads even as the storm made landfall and obviously Bill Nelson is in the area right now I'm you know trying to get a spotlight on himself are responsible storms are incredibly political and this was definitely no exception now\nWell will come to see a little bit and uh hopefully um the region is picking itself backup Lynn had her new stricter WFSU in Tallahassee, Florida thank you\nThanks for having me\nYou've been listening to hearing now where they've been giving us a lot of really interesting important context about this hurricane down in Florida hurricane Michael and uh I'm John Daley I'm the health reporter he recalled a public radio I'm

roads are closed and debris removal is key to get power trucks into the area he's urging the public to stay out of their way\nPast experience tells us that one of the greatest impediments to restoring

Georgia all running on generators for NPR News I'm Susanna Capelouto in Atlanta\nA lawyer for former Trump deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates calls him a model a cooperating witness NPR's Carrie

fight over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh makes it less likely the Democrats will win the Senate\nUm increasingly optimistic that we hold our majority now don't get much the huge difference\nAnd one of the good things about the Supreme Court sizes it underscores for Republican voters that the sun it was on the personal business ... and the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years of President Trump\nWith wins in the forty to fifty mile per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest range from this thankfully is a a little more located further inland ended amid stated up said region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly uh so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a a bad but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there was a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd do that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this though should stay just offshore but I certainly of this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in Massachusetts in up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S family and how did that happen\nVery warm water and the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase ended approach Lance and we've had several hurricanes and the last decade that have weekend as they approached land\nA reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they didn't hold up in terms of the forecast of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nWell just like Florence the track forecast from the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecast have improved remarkably over the decades\nBut the intensity forecast are still very challenging the science is still lagging behind a bit on forecasting exactly how intense storm may be when it actually comes ashore\n[noise] you've tried to a lot of hurricanes Jeff what stood out to you about Michael\nUm [noise] I think probably how far inland the hurricane force winds stretched we had I think especially a cat three when it crossed into Georgia the I was extremely compact and it it just barrel through it was a hundred miles inland that the there were still communist in the center of this storm that from a meteorological perspective\nThat's what's impressive and I don't want to say this is impressive Jeremy but right now I'm I'm very uh I guess it's worth noting that right now we only have two

anyway we're going was not no one was claiming the Brooklyn was kind of help or ... or republic that I was aware of when I was growing up [laughter]\nAnd so it's just interesting to see what Brooklyn has come to signify like I'm so it's quite a change so when you were young before you lived in Fort Greene you lived in another neighborhood right cobble hill\nIs ... the leaves were the first black family the moving to cobble hill couple who ... the point that had been historically Italian American working class neighborhood\nAnd what are your parents moved there knowing they'd be the only

Warren street\nBetween Henry street Clinton street in cobble hill and then my\nMother said you know we've got to buy a brownstone [noise] so we bought a brownstone a Washington\nPark between a Myrtle and will be in Nineteen sixty to eighty eight for like forty five thousand dollar back then we'll just wouldn't even used in the name for great and it would just say downtown distant and\nSo when you were probably very young when your parents moved to cobble hill and it wasn't telling American um neighborhood what what's that like for you as a young African American boy\nWill we get called the N word for like two weeks\nAnd then when it finally dawned on them they were not going to be\nHundreds of black families fallen leaves and the ... who was gonna go black all overnight\nThan we were just like any other kid [noise] two weeks after that and we're ... we're just a lot of my friends today or these guys I grew up you know in in ... a very young age especially the Tutsis ... shot up\n[laughter] so what was the school I was a school mostly way\nBut I went to public school ... twenty nine after a couple of years you know some Puerto Rican moved in the neighborhood but it was if

blaming the Federal Reserve and rising interest rates for this week stomach turning moves and the stock market as NPR's Scott Horsley explains the White House insists the president is not trying to interfere with the feds independence\nFor the second day in a row President Trump PIN responsibility for the stock market's gyrations on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve even though the fed is carefully telegraphed it's gradual move to boost interest rates Trump claims those rates are rising faster than he and others expected\nThat Bo Patterson the mayor of port saint Joe on the Florida Panhandle thank you very much mayor you\nBack here in Washington Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is sending a warning to voters with mid term elections now just twenty six days away he wants Republicans to no control of Congress is not the only thing to take\n... and the project of confirming drove dish is over for the last two years as President Trump betta ... to the people who like what we've been doing on the judge ... and ... or a majority\nNow NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell sat down with Senator McConnell in his office in the Capitol today for a wide ranging discussion and she was with me now for a wide ranging discussion on everything that they disgusted\nThe high there so Senator McConnell really sounding the alarm there for Republicans I'm how confident did he tell you he is that they will keep their Senate majority come November\nWell I have to say he sounded much more upbeat than he did even just a month ago people may remember that earlier this year he said this and it was absolutely in play now the conversation we had didn't really sound like that he told me that the fight over cabin on 'em that a justice Kevin came protested the right time\nEven when he was downplaying the general's failure the tax reform message for Republicans\nAs of the last week or so that was the hottest issue in our rushes become the Kavanaugh nomination we've seen\nA surgeon at first among Republican voters we knew the Democrats were fired up they have been all year no question about that\nBut what we now seeing is that um the enthusiasm and energy on the Republican side comes close to matching the Democratic side and given the states that were competing and that's really good news for us\nThat many times headed to an energized surveys do you worry that that had come to quickly is that is that something sustainable Republicans now that they have ... in the world they standardized and shut the well\nActually it comes right on the eve of the election among were only three three weeks out the timing for a surge really couldn't have been better not that this was all planned you understand but I mean it was a great a break for us in terms of energizing our own people\nAnother part of it that you talked about as you've called Democrats and angry mob actually even to use carbon mob\nOr declared the mall but angry mob that was not what I said about our Democrat colleagues\nI Do think that that would encourage a what went on and the Congress but you are here in ... we were literally under assault ourselves\nTrailing members for their homes getting in their faces you were in a capital M ever to clearly try to intimidate us in one of the reasons I was so proud of of the result last Saturday on judge Kavanaugh's that we stood up for two things which stood up to the mob\nAnd we are also shut up for the presumption of innocence\nOne major campaign promise that you were not able to sell it on health care and I'd like to know would you were scheduled to vote to repeal the Affordable CARE Act if you do to keep them into our next year\nI usually don't announce what I'm going to do this far in advance um that was a disappointment of is the single biggest disappointment this Congress\nAnd really the only major disappointment we we were able to move on so many different fronts or in fact if you're an American who prefers the country right of center I've said before and I would say they're going to do this has been the best Congress and the time I've been in the Senate\nYou acknowledge that your party has a significant gender gap it's something we've talked about quite a bit in the past couple of days Republicans are also behind with minorities and some other great what does it mean for the long term viability of the G ... if the party increasing it appeals mostly to heighten that\nWell you know we've done pretty well with Hispanics in the past\nAnd uh even the current president did better than a lot of people thought it was\nI think it's also important to remember the President Trump got nine out of town Republican votes and twenty sixteen not that every one of those nine out of ten who voted for him was thrilled with every aspect of what he was saying\nOh I think we're in a pretty good position going into these midterm elections I'm pretty optimistic will be able to hold our majority\nThere was a talk at one point in time about no dissecting where these losses for happening for Republicans particularly in the Hispanic community is it time for that to happen again\nWell I don't think there's any question that we would like to be doing better than we are with a Hispanic Americans although some of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in America I happened to be Republicans with regard to women voters we've always had something of a ... it's never been as wide as it is now\nWe have two great women running for the Senate this year Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee Martha ... Arizona I think we can improve our position with women voters which is found that voters are for sure\nWith African Americans we haven't been able to make much although I think it is noteworthy that a temp job as a member of our conference and he's arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina so\nThere is hope with African American voters as well but I'm a more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position with Spanish\nYou're looking ahead we talked to three and a half weeks away from this election how many Republicans will be in the Senate next year\nNow you know I'm not gonna [laughter] I'll\nSay out of their production business\nSometimes the non answers are telling that was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell speaking with our Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill today and Kelsey was there anything else he just wouldn't answer\nWell yeah I think it's important to note that this is a a longer interview that we kind of ... that it down for a time and he and I talked about a lot\nAnd one of the things he did that really struck me is that he avoided criticizing President Trump Adam and most issues particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the fed is crazy for raising interest rates McConnell just wouldn't go there\nAnd in that section about health care when we heard him say it was a major failure he didn't say it's a fight he wants to repeat and that's not what a lot of conservatives want to hear they wanted to hear that and Republicans are going to go back if they still have control and try again to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd on that same issue we got into an extended conversation about Republicans and protections for people with preexisting conditions on come to Senate candidates are involved in lawsuits to weaken those protections and he told me that Republicans are campaigning on keeping those protections and gave a contradictory response\nAbout how they can support those lawsuits but still on the protections in place\n[laughter] one thing that looked out at me listening ... back to your health care point he described as a failure to pass health care overhaul is the only major disappointment and I was thinking I I can think of others I mean what about comprehensive immigration reform they wanted to get that done it's not done\nThat really wasn't on his list and you know I hadn't been on the list for a lot of Republicans that I've talked to a who had worked on immigration many of them said that they still hold out hope that immigration could be part of a broader conversation later in the air potentially around spending I'm speaking you're spending and speaking of immigration to you\nAsk about the border wall which people are talking about again funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico\nYeah I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over the border wall with Mexico he says he wants to try to get funding for the wall but he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans he\nSaid about you know money for about one year roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether and now that's not the big down payment or major investment that some in the house are talking about and that sets up the possibility of an immigration conversation other big spending fight one\nThing that you that you raised with him was women and where women are left post Kavanaugh's confirmation battle um he acknowledge that there's always been something of a gender gap in terms of voters for ... for Republicans and acknowledge that is going to be a challenge\nYeah absolutely and he said that he is going to make an effort to get more women on the Senate Judiciary committee next year he says he's asked in the past and he's going to ask again\nAll right NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell talking about her interview today with Mitch McConnell are there on Capitol Hill

C. so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively um casts doubt on ... been selling man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time\nWhen Mohamed ... says he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformers that America should Hitchens wagon to this\nIs interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been\nSeen as a as a more of a danger than others but he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and an outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's a different you know if I criticize Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if Jim out to shove you did that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "11"}
