in artificial intelligence could discriminate against women job applicants a story we covered the other day or the powerful trait in tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers has just come up with a new ethics certification process\nIt's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hertz is transparent about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of the ... artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for coming in\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nWell I think in general it's sort of an idea of the contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's this new things that people have to understand are trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sand so I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and then actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them all\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the entire other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions\nAnd so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I ... about consensus building globally is to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn ... is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems at the height Tripoli he's also author of

C.\nAnd I'm David Greene in New York City a group of migrants is focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America\nThey have been labeled a caravan we're talking about up words the seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are hard and you said it's the talk of people and I don't want them in Asia and\nNow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them either James\nI Do so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys is probably three or four years old\nOr with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk to more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's\nI guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\nYet and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here um because\nYesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so we've\nBeen obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise] so ... you're right we we have been seeing for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad\nUm you know talking to people about why during this caravan of why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest the best place they can be\nOkay then of course President Trump now saying though that they are not going to be allowed into the country is a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you American\nVoters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures and many governors Democrats have a chance to gain back some of the governorships they have lost to Republicans only sixteen fifty governors right now are Democrats\nAmericans are working to defend their games including and the very red state of Kansas here's Jim McLean of the Kansas news service\nLaura Kelly is a veteran member of the Kansas Senate and the ... democratic nominee for governor she's doing our best to keep the memory of four Republican governor Sam Brownback fresh in the minds of Kansas voters\nParticularly the memory of how the income tax cuts that Brownback champion crashed the budget and forced to cut funding for schools highways and healthcare\nWe can either backwards and repeat the last eight years from\n\nProbably isn't running against Trump back who moved on to the Trump Administration but in debates like this what if it has a state fair she misses no opportunity to talk her Republican opponent Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to the former governor and his policies\nKris Kobach is making it very clear where he will take us as a state he will take us back to the devastation that we had just lived through\nKelly is getting help from from politics affected sources some big name Republicans at least big occasions or jumping party lines to support\nLaura Kelly is the only Democrat I have every office moderate\nRepublicans don't raise was governor of Kansas from Nineteen Ninety five to two thousand two\nMore to me has all these all the capabilities that we're looking to

Trump's initial was delivered on Twitter the day before the primary might've been the difference maker and his razor thin victory over the incumbent governor and he's counting on the president's recent visit to Kansas to energize his base in the final weeks of a general election campaign that's coming down to the wire\nTo put it simply I\nWant to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America [noise]\nProvocative Kelly virtually deadlocked that means that race could be decided by independent Greg Orman he's a wealthy businessman from the Kansas City suburbs who's hoping to exploit what he believes is widespread voter frustration\nI traveled through the state of Kansas I find talking to Republicans and talking to Democrats up you know sort of a broad dissatisfaction with what's going on right now and the fact that we don't seem to be solving problems we seem to be having food fights\nIn twenty fourteen was no Democrat in the race or been through a scare in a Republican U.S Senator Pat Roberts but this time around he's pulling in single digits even so says former Democratic governor Kathleen civilians that could be enough to tilt the race\nHe certainly can be a spoiler Greg Orman could elect Kris Kobach governor and less Kansas voters are paying a lot of attention\nPaying attention to the likes of graves and casual bum who were urging moderate

believing the pot tax was going to funnel lots of money to school my name is Nancy button them I was wondering Nancy putting them totally Colorado wonders that was her assumption when she voted for amendments sixty four and twenty twelve to make recreational pot legal\nPutting them and I listen to a TV ad she would have heard back them\nAll for the good guys and gals gosh am I actually don't wash hall and ... and ... oh okay so just wandered away from that\nIs pretty vague and it said you know to\nConstruct new schools are reconstruct or schools or something like that yep\nOkay something like that first thing to note is not all of the pot revenues go to schools about forty one percent is for other departments most of the dealing with the regulation of marijuana like preventing illegal grow operations and distribution and for other public services like jailed diversion programs and impaired driving campaigns\nSo about forty seven percent set aside for schools but wait it just isn't for anything schools really need to stay open so teachers\nSalaries whatever that they can't use it for a teacher salaries are textbooks or bus drivers or keeping the lights on\nSome other special pot sales tax does fund one time grand schools can use for things like keeping kids off drugs preventing bullying promoting literacy\nAnd a separate tax on marijuana growers is contributing to a fund for repairing and renovating school buildings fixing roofs and occasionally building new schools\nChristian Hoffman from evergreen gets it but\nIt was supposed to go to buildings repair new schools with my understand\nBut she and her friends see that in Jefferson County there is a half a billion dollar bond measure on her local ballot to repair and renovate old schools that's why she ask drew Colorado wonders\nWhere is the marijuana and many from taxes that was supposed to help offset some of those costs yes\nIt's supposed to offset those tough but here's why it's simply isn't making much of a dent for most schools the growers pot tax has contributed about forty million a year into a building fund that districts can only access if they can match the funding that means going to voters\nCompare that to the amount Kristen Hoffman's district just one district needs for school repairs\nA half a billion dollars\nAnd the amount schools across the state estimate they need to fix their buildings had is fourteen billion dollars in case you missed that fourteen billion dollars a new school cost about twenty five million dollars so maybe the marijuana tax would help pay for a couple of new school year across the state\nNow this isn't to say just go isn't getting any pop money remember that part retail tax that pays for substance abuse and drop out programs things like that but tell Hoffman Jeff ... total amount\nAnd just go has received two million dollars since the marijuana funding began this is less than point three percentage of ... general fund annual budget\nPoint three percent has it been reporting on this story it strikes me how people think this really thriving industry marijuana must be contributing scads of money it's hard to grasp how little money comes into schools for pot so back at Johns ... near his favorite pot shops\nWe have to round objects here I'm trying to experiment with him so we can visualize it so this is a chocolate chip cookie and it's delicious but for the way and you eat this cooking yeah sure I'm a little against the carbohydrate thing but I Will living on the edge\nI ask him to imagine the cookie as the entire kindergarten through twelfth grade public school budget and we're going to cut us wise to represent how much of the budget comes from marijuana taxes\nSevere slice cooking [noise] there there was one\nPoint six percent of the total who lived the\nLife of school budget pie from marijuana taxes is like the width of a number to pencil one point six percent\nSo does that surprise you yes I I Do think that the surprising part which is completely understood is that I as a user a regular user of marijuana and just seeing with my own eyes made the assumption that sounds like the incorrect assumption feet inflated\nAssumption that in fact if you took\nAll pot taxes the slice it makes up of the entire state budget not just schools is the width of a stick of spaghetti point seven eight percent\nLet's be clear schools are happy with whatever they can get from pot taxes but it doesn't bond with schools they they really need money for enough money to increase teacher salaries lower class sizes pay for mental health supports and by updated textbooks\nSo that's why you'll continue to see schools seeking money like measure amendment Seventy three that voters will see on the ballot I'm Jenny branding

DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in New York City a group of migrants is focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America they have been labeled a caravan we're talking about up words the seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities\nSpoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are hardening detaining seated tuft of people and I don't want them in action\nNow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them Hi there James I do so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys you've probably three or four years old\nOr with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk to more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\nYet and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here um because\nYesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so\nWe've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise] so ... you're right we we have been saying for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad\nUm you know talking to people about why during this caravan of why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because\nThis migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest the best place they can be\nOkay then of course president I'm not saying though that they are not going to be allowed into the country a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you American voters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures and many governors Democrats have a chance to gain back some of the governorships they have lost to Republicans only sixteen\nFifty governors right now are Democrats Republicans are working to defend their games including in the very red state of Kansas\nHere's Jim McLean of the Kansas news service\nLaura Kelly is a veteran member of the Kansas Senate and the twenty Eighteen democratic nominee for governor she's doing our best to keep the memory of former Republican governor Sam Brownback fresh in the minds of Kansas voters\nParticularly the memory of how the income tax cuts that Brownback champion crashed the budget and forced to cut funding for schools highways and healthcare\nWe can either backwards and repeat the last eight years from\n\nKelly isn't running against from back who moved on to the Trump Administration but in debates like this one at the Kansas State fair she misses no opportunity to talk her Republican opponent Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to the former governor and his policies\nKris Kobach is making it very clear where he will take us as a state he will take us back to the devastation that we had just lived through\nKelly is getting help from some unexpected sources some big name Republicans at least the cans are jumping party lines to support\nLaura Kelly is the

Trump's initial adores was delivered on Twitter the day before the primary might have been the difference maker and his razor thin victory over the incumbent governor and he's counting on the president's recent visit to Kansas to energize his base in the final weeks of a general election campaign that's coming down to the wire\nTo put it simply I Want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America [noise]\nJoe ... Kelly virtually deadlocked that means that race could be decided by independent Greg Orman he's a wealthy businessman from the Kansas City suburbs who's hoping to exploit what he believes is widespread voter frustration\nI traveled to the state of Kansas I find talking to Republicans and talking to Democrats up you know sort of a broad dissatisfaction with what's going on right now and the fact that we don't seem to be solving problems we seem to be having food fights\nIn twenty fourteen was no Democrat in the race or been through a scare into Republican U.S Senator Pat Roberts but this time around he's pulling in single digits even so says former Democratic governor Kathleen civilians that could be enough to tilt the race\nHe certainly can be a spoiler Greg Norman could elect Kris Kobach governor and less Kansas voters are paying a lot of attention\nPaying attention to the likes of graves and casual bum who are urging moderate Republicans in particular across party lines

through Wednesday\nTemperatures near Seventy this afternoon around Denver dropping\nInto the sixties for a couple of days this is CPR news\nMy name is Nancy button them I was wondering Nancy cutting them told Colorado wonders that was her assumption when she voted\nFor amendments sixty four and twenty twelve to make recreational pot legal putting them and I listened to a TV ad she would have heard back\nThen for the good guys against them at ... am I actually don't wash off a cat and in some cases you away from that\nIs pretty vague and it said you know to\nConstruct new schools are reconstruct our schools or something like that yeah\nSomething like that first thing to note is not all of the pot revenues go to schools about forty one percent is for other departments most of the dealing with the regulation of marijuana like preventing illegal grow operations and distribution and for other public services like jailed diversion programs and impair driving campaigns\nSo about forty seven percent set aside for schools but wait it just isn't for anything schools really need to stay open the teachers' salaries whatever that they can't use it for teachers' salaries are textbooks or bus drivers or keeping the lights on\nSome other special pot sales tax does fund one time grand schools can use for things like keeping kids off drugs preventing bullying promoting literacy\nAnd a separate tax on marijuana growers is contributing to a fund for repairing and renovating school buildings fixing roofs and occasionally building new schools Christian Hoffman from evergreen gets it but\nIt was supposed to go to buildings repair new schools with my understand\nBut she frenzy that in Jefferson County there's a half a billion dollar bond measure on her local ballot to repair and renovate old schools that's why she asks through Colorado wonders\nWhere is the marijuana and money from taxes that was supposed to help offset some of those costs yes\nIt's supposed to offset those tough but here's why it's simply isn't making much of a dent for most schools the growers pot tax has contributed about forty million a year into a building fund that districts can only access if they can match the funding that means going to voters\nCompare that to the amount Kristen Hoffman's district just one district needs for school repairs a half a billion dollars\nAnd the amount schools across the state estimate they need to fix their buildings had is fourteen billion dollars in case you missed that fourteen billion dollars a new school cost about twenty five million dollars so maybe the marijuana tax would help pay for a couple of new school year across the state\nNow this isn't to say just go isn't getting any pop money remember the ... retail tax that pays for substance abuse and drop out programs things like that it's ... ... total amount\nAnd just go has received two million dollars since the marijuana funding began this is less than point three percentage ... general fund annual budget\nPoint three percent of their reporting on this story it strikes me how people think this really thriving industry marijuana must be contributing scads of money it's hard to grasp how little money comes into schools for pot so back at Johns ... help your favorite pot shops\nWe have to round objects here I'm trying to experiment with him so we can visualize it so this is a chocolate chip cookie and it's still wish for further away can you eat this cooking yeah sure I'm\nA little against the carbohydrate thing but I Will living on the edge\nI ask them to imagine the cookie as the entire kindergarten through twelfth grade public school budget and we're going to cut us life to represent how much of the budget comes from marijuana taxes\n[noise] severe slice cooking [noise] there there was one point six percent of the total\nSchool budget the\nLife of school budget pie from marijuana taxes is like the width of a number to pencil one point six percent\nSo does that surprise you yes I I Do think that the surprising part which is completely understood is that I as a user a regular user of marijuana and just seeing with my own eyes made the assumption that sounds like the incorrect assumption the inflated\nAssumption that in fact if you took\nAll the taxes the slice it makes up of the entire state budget not just schools is the width of a stick of spaghetti point seven eight percent\nLet's be clear schools are happy with whatever they can get from pot taxes but it doesn't fun with schools they they really need money for enough money to increase teachers' salaries lower class sizes pay for mental health supports invite updated textbooks\nSo that's why you'll continue to see schools seeking money like measure amendment Seventy three that voters will see on the ballot I'm Jenny branding Colorado Public radio news\nIf you want to know where the pot money does go in Colorado we've got it's
