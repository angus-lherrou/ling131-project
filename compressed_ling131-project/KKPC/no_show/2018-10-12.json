one night you say you couldn't bear it anymore\n[noise] it's really sad to hear you read that out loud [laughter]\nI wrote it and I lived it for them that that was sad\nSo that night was just absolutely dreadful I mean I was convinced that this is the way it will always be and I couldn't see a way out\nAnd that's often a function of deep depression ... ... ... and here I'm not talking about depression as being in a blue moon or feeling down or I mean and depressed me and I'm Talking about depression as a as a clinical phenomenon\nAnd one thing we know is that it's a cognitive phenomenon too so that people who have depression their problem solving ability is greatly reduced and that's where\nSuicide can really become alluring is that they can't see other ways to solve their problems they can't see other ways out of their pain\nWhat would you like to share about your suicide attempt to finally see\nUm well I think the most important thing would be that change is possible you know that in in that state of mind people can get to a place where they think it's impossible to feel better\nBut if they're focused solely on how bad it is is there a possibility of changing their mind yeah this is the critical question about youth suicide in particular\nYes I think you know even if you can only change their mind like even if just in a conversation you can inject just a little bit of hope for a little bit of light than they know that it's possible to feel different and\nI think this is something we're seeing with a new drug called ketamine not very new but it's being nearly tested with suicidal people it's having dramatic effects and I think part of it is that it's very temporary but at least then people can see okay I can feel differently it takes the blinders ... even if temporarily\nIs this something you're seeing prescribe more and more it's still in the experimental stages though I Wonder if there's a power to being a therapist who has had the experience the patients might be going through\nI think that there are some gifts and then I think there are some things to be to be aware of as well but I mean I think one thing that I take from my experience is I'm not scared to talk about suicidal thoughts with my clients\nAnd I speak with a lot of therapists because I provide consulting too who are just terrified of even asking somebody if they're having suicidal thoughts and may ease\nThe fear that if they ask they might ... the idea\nYes very much that's their fear\nAnd in reality people know about suicide already we're not telling them something they don't know but the other fear is that the person will say yes and then they were afraid of what to do and how to do it\nWhy don't we take a break and then pick up this discussion

for your generosity\nThis is Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar tonight longtime Denver developer and preservation is Dana Crawford will receive the governor citizenship medals for her pioneering work to revitalize historic buildings and urban areas in this state\nOne of Denver's most charming blocks ... square was saved from the wrecking ball more than fifty years ago because of Crawford\nShe went on to develop other historic properties in the city including the Oxford hotel Union Station and the flour mill lofts where she now lives and it's where we went recently to catch up with Crawford would eighty seven is working on new preservation projects around Colorado\nShe's also speaking out against a plan to build two new towers on ... square as we were setting up Crawford recalled her quest decades ago to preserve the flour mill building\nI thought this building with just stunning and most everybody thought I was insane and the neighbors all called this see through building and they wanted it torn down\nSee through as in it looked bombed out the Crawford managed to convince city leaders and investors that the building was worth saving and converting into loft\nWe were a little bit under construction but no glass was in the windows and the trains go by you know twenty five feet from here\nSo and the two of my four sons are sitting up here and the train goes by and it sounds like an atomic bomb because we have doubled lazy now and there's a train going by right now big coal train but you can hear it [laughter] anyway So Peter sister's younger brother she's really lost at this time [laughter] you\nKnow sitting at her dining room table I asked in Crawford about the future of Larimer square just a few blocks away\nJeff hermanson knows this proposal he CEO of ... associates which owns the block the idea was to add to new multi story buildings one with affordable housing but it would mean a partial demolition of several old buildings what do you believe is wrong with the\nPlan well I have to say that when I first thought I was intrigued however when I began to study it and I realized that one of the high rise buildings was to be forty stories high\nAnd it would involving superimposed over one of the most important in historic buildings the suffix it would have dark and all of them are square practically\nAnd one of my favorite times of year is when the kids come down in the spring and the third grade and fourth grade when they studied Colorado's history and they can actually see and feel a commercial district from around the turn of the last century pretty low slung one yeah\nAnd the world was fun man and so they have an opportunity to really\nUnderstand and feel\nWhat their community it came from so that would be ended I think that many of the tenants that have been there a long time would not be able to remain a as you mentioned the demolition of\nPart of the buildings so ... square present day defense what they're trying to do is figure out how to finance the ongoing maintenance of those buildings and here comes a trained by the way yes\nI'm so that was I think the thinking behind building these two new buildings and getting income for them to finance the improvements\nOr rehabilitation from my perspective and now since I've talked to so many people about it from a lot of perspective it's not only kills Larimer square but it also threatens everything we've worked on\nAll these years to get the character maintained throughout the city because if they do that to learn more square then it opens up the political gates to change everything\nI mean the plan came under heavy criticism is I think you're reflecting there from preservation is including the national trust for historic preservation which put ... square on its list of America's eleven most endangered historic places will say the owners have put the\nPlan on hold but they say ... squares buildings need significant rehabilitation is it possible to do that with out changing ... squares character\nAbsolutely yes it's been done all over the country Charleston South Carolina Philadelphia Boston\nBuildings much older than ours so it can be done\nI think there are some who would just be perplexed by the idea that ... square could be fundamentally changed at all if it's on a register ... helped me understand the well\nThe kind of tragic thing in a way is fifty percent of the buildings that have been placed on the national register have been demolished um there's no protection for them there is protection usually in local land marketing and Larimer square is a local landmark\nI should point out the Denver city council president Elvis Brooks told the Denver Post tearing down any historic building is dead on arrival and the he edited revitalization and preservation can co exist\nThat is exactly correct\nOur encore conversation with Dana Crawford continues in a moment we'll move beyond Denver and talk about some of her

communities across the state for thirty five years learn more at play on Colorado dot com\nHi my name is Todd McCullough I'm from Fort Collins Colorado and I'm a regular CPR listener and I'm calling because I just donated a CPR on drive and I wanted to tell you the real reason why I I don't it it's day\nThere's because my eight year old daughter\nA hurt the fund drive on the radio and asked uh what's that about and we explained that\nPeople need to shift to support MTR CPR otherwise programs like this won't exist [laughter] and she got really scared look on her face and she said oh you better give I Love NPR\nBuilt feeding off of the energy of African American women's but understanding that this one election cycle is not enough it was a five year trajectory that we're on to make sure we sustained\nMovement but more importantly mid term election is the low water mark for voting presidential lectures or high water mark and that as a result of a a heavy concentration of ad by campaigns I use it now that you that presidential elections like a Coca Cola size\nOr add budget by upper mid term elections like RC called an ad by your reminded constantly doing president's election so more people go to vote but the mid term elections you don't hear about it as often\nAs you were there for you have a lower voter turnout and so our goal is to do supplement that lack of information understanding unimportant by talking to infrequent voters those individuals who voted on presidential elections\nBut do photo a midterm election and using people in the community to go and courage in hold their hands and continue to remind them of the important of the vote\nI also am reminded of say the work of higher heights because not only are they trying to get women to come out to vote there also inspiring and supporting financially and in other ways\nBlack women to actually run for office and so in doing this multi step process you have black women\nAs voters you have black women as donors and you also have black women as candidates that three pronged approach actually has been increasing black female participation on hosted levels because now you had people who were invested\nEmotionally mentally and also financially in the wellbeing of particular black women from across the country and so as they build this fifty state network\nFrom not just women like Stacey Abrams running for governor of Georgia but we're talking about ... in Illinois running for Congress but also people who are running in lower levels um that are part of this larger network\nIn higher heights I think that's also a sustaining approach to make sure that black women are involved in a year round\nPolitical process you know that those who just every two to four years\nSo when Valerie Jarrett was here the former senior advisor to President Obama and she's on the board of I'm I'm\nMichelle Obama's group when we all when we all vote the whole purpose is to get people to vote not just in the big elections but in the little like a little elections ... how do you know I started to talk to both of you how do you convince\nPeople who don't have a tradition of voting that voting for literally dog catcher school board judges um ... is is important\nI Do this with my students all the time and I'll say this really briefly when people were watching the Brett Kavanaugh hearing and there were so outraged by\nCertain senators and their behavior and also the age dynamic where we saw many of our elected leaders are where well above Seventy years old I reminded than that so many of them got their start in state houses which then turned into\nThem being members of the house which turned into than being senators and so these individuals' had been in the political process\nSort of in these competitive or sometimes not even not even competitive primary but definitely the vast majority are not even in competitive general election races so there is centrally walking into a D.C\nEvery two four six years depending on on what officer holding and so it is important for them to invest early\nIn elected officials on the state house level keep in mind Shirley Chisholm from New York state got her start in Albany before\nShe became the first black woman to represent New York state in Congress and so it local politics matters and so for a our previous caller is very important to not just vote in mid term and presidential year elections but if you are in place like New York city you have to vote in municipal elections as well\nGo ahead you know the the question was how do we get low propensity or infrequent voters for both the civil was there was talk to them\nTo communicate with them the magical Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nIs not the result of her win a primary this year the magic is she started four years five years ago matter of fact and she started talking to people getting the ... vote\nBuilding a report communicate with them build a lot of infrastructure and talking to them the magic of Andrew Gillum is not the fact that he was married just before he ran for governor it was the fact that he and share Letterman built an infrastructure talk to people\nDay in and day out and and it it in a way in which folks felt empowered to say okay I don't know about the voting thing but I Know her because she listened to me she talked to me but most importantly if we look at the history of African American voting\nWe hit a low point in terms of growth in twenty sixteen right because we want to twenty two thousand eight we didn't know how we won because it was

sequence\nOh yeah I mean a ... a lot of the stuff we did not first almost one wasn't fun to make it but it was very fun to write it\nWhy wasn't it fun to make it\nGoes to shoot a film you have to raise money and it was a brutal task raised and how does somebody five thousand dollars for this film [noise] she's gonna have was shot in the summer in Nineteen eighty five from July first July fourteenth to sixty weeks\nAnd uh it was almost killed me why\nMe no one knew I was I was I've been I graduate in when you graduate film school nights and the two so from that moment like graduated to a began to shoot some eighty five every day was spent trying to get a future film made\n[noise] but you know watching she's got to have it I felt then and I feel now having we watched it that there's such a joy of filmmaking in it and you're trying all these things out you know you're trying ... like the one we just heard you have these like crazy ... you have really kind of\nLike timely sparkling dialogue it's it's all obviously being done so cheaply but it has such kind of style um so ... was it hard for you to preserve that love a filmmaking that joy of filmmaking lifestyle while you were also feeling the sun's going to kill me\nKnow because I was doing I loved and I made a decision the summer between my sophomore year and junior morals college that this way I Want to do I felt this McAllen and a half to get it done\nAnd we've been doing it for the last two decades\nStanding back and looking at both versions of she's got to have it\nWhich examine relationships with an emphasis on sexual relationships didn't making either of those versions both of those versions\nGive you an opportunity or force you to really think about relationships in a way that you hadn't before\nNot really and also we got to put just in the store go perspective the original film\nCame out in Nineteen eighty six this came out twenty Seventeen\nI don't know what I was doing with the first film and then I was a young man very very young man and now\nI turn sixty while we were shooting is so is this universe from two different Spike Lee\nSo when you made the first version your idea of commitment and monogamy was probably different than you made this ... since now you are sixty and you're married and you have grandchildren [laughter] can you talk a little bit about that that trajectory of getting to the point of commitment\nAnd or what what the idea of family meant to you of having making a family did you think you'd want to do that when you were making\nAll you had a very very good question but here's the thing I made a pact myself I was not going to be married or have chosen to our successful for financial yes\nNot want to have to choose between feeding my children and buying a rule so\nI can understand that and your father was an artist I mean your father is an artist yeah he's just he's still alive he's a jazz musician he's a bass player composer often face piano what did you learn about what it means to be an artist and try to support a family from watching your father\nI learned that does nothing poetic about being a ... an artist\nI knew that and I knew that uh I wanted\nTo ask a use of the greatest lines in the godfather I Wonder what might be if my films made money I wanted to be able to get my fair share of the\nMoney to be made from my artwork I just knew that the I just saw my father struggle great great great musician\nThat there's nothing ... about being poor\nAt one time um my father was the leading jazz bassist jazz folk basically ...

Hi Mary Louise so that you're you\nHas been around for a century since around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about them was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of to G R U agents of alleged agents who were accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a ... swap was living in Britain\nThe difference though in this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all ... and his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nAttempts that did not managed to assassinate the two people who were being targeted go on that is\nCorrect and the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go ... are back in Russia and let me just very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing insults Barry but if we were\nSo the so there are blaming their explain that solves bears is beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you were going to to England\nYou would make a trip to solve barriers to see this church tower the hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and flashy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones\nRight and so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced that just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents\nAh with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing the the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March\nUm now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow had only been used a couple of days earlier\nI'm even found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were ...\nI think what we could say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there is this naming and shaming and providing details at a level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond\nOr two months ago President Trump has signed a directive that would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nThat parents garden Ira thank you thank you\nHi this is Eric from Denver, Colorado or I Am a definition of if you're lucky I listen to drive about four hours a day and I never changed the dial\nFrom a Bronx Tale here on Colorado Public radio I'm Jim east Carla walkers here and I I think I can speak for your call your you're going to say yes I'm a color of radio junkie too\nAnd I'm all
