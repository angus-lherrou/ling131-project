Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're speaking with NPR's Kirk Siegler who is just back from a reporting trip to Grand Junction where he is looked at how that community\nIs struggling with suicide and how to prevent it and the natural question comes up Kirk and and this is something that some in rural America are resistant to but access to firearms and perhaps limiting\nTo guns or how do people in Mesa County react when you bring that up\n[noise] well I think it's it's being more talked about it to\nMore talked about than it has a about three or four years ago I was in Wyoming\nPutting on a similar story directly looking at the access to guns issue [noise]\nUh and that's a tricky one for folks in suicide prevention to navigate um you know the rural west nine of the ten states with the highest suicide rates in the country are in the rural west including Alaska in those states also happen to have some of the highest of firearm ownership rates in the country\nSo I think the trick is or I don't want to say necessarily a trick but the the the challenges sort of bifurcated the two by saying like we're not talking about gun control we're talking about suicide prevention and\nAnd uh this is not about taking your guns away this is about making sure that your guns are locked up or in a safe place or being able to um recognize somebody who might be in trouble or at risk were vulnerable to harming themselves and keeping the firearms away from them this could be in the family\nThis could be at the gun shops in fact there's a\nA fairly active a gunshot project going on in Mesa County in another\nWestern slope community is trying to educate people about and and gun shop owners and clerks about recognizing some of the warning signs but it is a ... it is a very tricky issue and one that's difficult to navigate in particular in the rural west where\nA gun ownership is sort of woven tightly in folks identity I don't want to sound so academic there but it is a big part of the culture I don't need to tell you\nA suicide or buy firearms is also a huge uh issue and in fact a majority of people in Mesa County and I daresay few surveyed other western a rural counties guns is how people commit this final act\nYou spoke with Genevieve Morris she's a suicide prevention coordinator from Mesa County valley school district fifty one\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing things that need to change\nAnd part of what you talked about needing to change Kirk is just the [noise] a stigma around mental health around suicide I Wonder if you might tell us about another perhaps exceptional young person you met maybe one who has had personal experience and their family with suicide\nOnes who comes to mind is an eighth grader who's also a you know peer to peer counselor within the middle school districts really young now in Mesa County\nUh she both her father and her uncle um had died by suicide um just some heart wrenching stories it's not hard to find somebody who knows somebody as I said\nA and getting around the even being able to talk about it um you know the rural west in particular is known as you know very rugged individual ism at least that's the\nThe stereotype and um you know you just got to pull yourself up and and even if you're struggling like there's a stigma around sort of asking for help there's also not a lot of resources and a lot of these places one thing that really stuck out to me was that\nUh there's only one mental health hospital um between Denver in Salt Lake City uh there are they are adding beds but there's only a few dozen vets there so you also have to talk about lack of resources in rural areas in particular Turk thanks so much certainly it wasn't some\nI'm so sorry to say that's that's all I'm for it today and we look forward to the reports coming from you on this glad to be here particular covers the divide between rural and urban America for NPR he visited Grand Junction to look at how that community is responding to the high suicide rate [noise]\nStill to come students commit to month long social media purges this is Colorado matters from CPR news\nHi this is Daniel in Denver and CPR is of vital

hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nYeah getting it's not mandatory when you listen to Colorado Public radio but when you get a gift you are voicing your support for a community resource that you think is important you think it's important you're listening right now during the membership drive you you think it's important because you still want to get the news that you're going to hear\nComing

whether or how much you know people are supporting the other thing is your gift right now is completely selfish because you get under during this trip to London and that could be you ... over to London direct from Denver by the way to non-stop flight\nMost weeks almost pod cast were the ones posing questions about Colorado ahead of the election this week something a little bit different or answering a question from one view\nI'm Jonas was into I'm a sophomore at Denver Jewish day school I'm sixteen 'cause that's about it\nContacted us do our Colorado wonders project at the new CPR effort trying to export\nThe state one question at a time and you contacted us with a question about Colorado politics me go ahead and say what that question was\nYeah the question was is Colorado is still a swing state [noise]\nWhy someone too young to vote even wondering about something like this well for John is this came up as he reflected on his earliest experiences with politics\nFire contracts late in those kindergarten in fourth grade we had mocked presidential elections\nWe went into the closet and feel that a ballad and see I remember the ballot\nWith on green paper and had the two candidates Mitt Romney rocket bomb and John McCain and Barack Obama\nA bomb is a mixed result in these two elections he won in kindergarten the law enforcement ... when he came to either these do classroom elections or the real deal Jonas had the feeling that Colorado was up for grabs\nAnd I do remember you sort of vaguely at the time\nThat Colorado was important nationally lots of politicians visited there is a ton of ads on the air and he says it just didn't feel the same and twenty sixteen like there was a bit less attention a bit less coverage on Colorado it seemed like it didn't occupy so much of a national bottom they\nSure did candidates campaign here but pundits talked about Colorado and all but a sure bet for Hillary Clinton and she ended up winning here by about three point two years from now joined us will be eligible to vote and he's not sure what to expect\nI Want to know what I should be looking for if I should be looking at Colorado politics from the perspective of swing state voter are from the perspective that said they date voter I Want to know\nWhat sort of policies I expect Colorado politicians both in the state and nationally to advocate and I want to know what my fellow Coloradans think about things [noise]\nAnd it's not just joined us asking this question this is something I wandered ahead of watching this podcast I mean this is probably obvious but it's called purplish because Colorado isn't red or blue but purple it's in the middle and host competitive elections but is that label even true anymore\nAnd this is about more than our branding competitive elections help consulting so advice TV station sell ads journalists like me grab your attention and it arguably helps voters to says Seth mascot he's a political scientist at the University of Denver\nIt basically means the state party the national parties will develop a lot more attention they'll devote a lot more resources there'll be a lot more media attention on those contests or that usually stimulates voter interest in voter turnout\nIn fact Colorado has among the highest voter turnout in the country some of that may have to do with the state's mail in ballot system which makes finding a stamp the hardest part of voting\nBut it can't hurt that voters here feel like their voices matter so this weekend purplish how purple Colorado really in our days of occupying the political center and the political center of attention numbered\nThere's a narrative out there about Colorado is political leanings and it goes something like this\nOnce upon a time Colorado was a reliable Republican state and it pretty much stayed that way to the beginning of this century minute voted for George W. Bush and his wife and the Rocky Mountain west Colorado State of Colorado\nHe ran\nFor President George don't\nBut that's something to change after two thousand and four when younger more educated people started moving to Colorado they created an opportunity for Democrats who sees it\nThan you know it [noise]\n\nI'm a accepted the Democratic nomination in Denver on a stage midfield at bronco stadium before winning the state in two thousand and eight and he wasn't here again in twenty twelve\nBattleground states and the west one of the most closely watched was Colorado\nAnd just as he did and ten thousand a President Obama to stay\nHome and in twenty sixteen Hillary Clinton dominated involving Colorado media outlets started declaring that the state had fallen off the electoral map celebrate\nAll the Colorado is it's also time to talk about what Colorado isn't anymore a swing state\n\n... there were numbers to back that up head of the twenty sixteen election Democrats outpaced Republicans among registered voters in Colorado for the first time in three decades and on a night when Trump won the electoral college Colorado went for Clinton\nWe had another protection right now is the protection for Hillary state of Colorado\nIn this story twenty six teams supposedly marked a kind of a rival for Colorado on a journey from red to purple too now light blue\nBut some people aren't totally sold on this suppose a tale of political transformation Sam breaks it down further after a break this is Colorado matters and purple lush from CPR news\nEarnings Ryan I live in Grand junction\nAnd I've been listening to NPR and CPR since I was exposed to it through my best friend and middle school his parents and right now I deliver pizzas but I listen to it several hours a night and I feel like\nYou know that amount of time spent consuming deserves a price tax if I can afford it and I feel like I can afford it I wasn't able to and stuff I decided to call up and make a donation I'm an African partner thanks very\nWell thank you Ryan in Grand junction and did you hear that he started listening to Colorado Public radio in middle school you have the opportunity now to turn on some young person into CPR by donating\nSo that it will still be here when they are delivering pizzas or you know in their work life or you know when they had children to use the word Colorado Public radio now in this service stays healthy way into the future so that people that are not born yet maybe we'll be able to enjoy what\nYou listen to know at CPR or go to CPR dot org to make that gift or call eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nWhen you get right now you're also going to get automatically entered into our sweepstakes we had a seven night trip for two to London a that is what is up right now for when you get to Colorado Public radio this is an eighty five hundred dollar value\nAnd check out what this includes it's a nonstop round trip flight on British Airways between

and you're automatically added to win this trip to London go to CPR dot org to set up your evergreen membership or called eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nHunting has really seemed to be the most contentious aspect of this\nWe have Tar Heel Barbara back on the line I think ... Hi Barbara Simon thought sorry about that so go ahead what do you think of us\nSo I just wanted to say that this is one of six constitutional amendments that are a Republican super majority has put on the\nOn the ballot because they're very concerned that the majority might actually be broken and this one I mean it has a nice ... like yes we should keep those kind of national puppies state wide popular pastime I'm protected but what people are concerned about it and it's going to keep\nThis tape from being able to for example keep people from from gauging and a poisoning different kinds of animals that it's going to allow for constitutional challenges to really reasonable environmental protection and also go get my land up being just kind of a burden for for like\nFake commercial interests so for if we tried to do something to stop over\n... saying that it would like to actually help kind of the hobby is a really big business and travel and I really agree with\nYour speaker has said that it's it's it's clear that they that Republicans are worried about it enthusiasm gap at the polls and said that says this is just designed to to drive up a conservative turnout so far\nBut thanks for for all of that on that last observation and you brought it up to Canada is a ballot measure that's designed really to gin up turn out on behalf of candidates or I mentioned earlier in the show how that was used to great effect and the two thousand four presidential election year\nIn Ohio where conservatives put an anti gay marriage referendum on the ballot that drove conservative turnout and George W. Bush won reelection by a hair that year because we won the ultimate swing state of Ohio by a hair that year with all that extra Republican turnout\nThat people believe that dollar question generated are you seeing that anywhere else in particular\nYou mean in a in terms of kind of using one issue to to get at the other yeah I personally have not seen that so much in in any of the ones that I've covered but\nAnd of course a advocates of this right to hunt measure say that that's not the case and even if that is the case what's the harm in having more voters that the polls [laughter] you know\nLet me get a couple of more um callers in here from around the country coffee in the Bronx was a ballot measure you're following\nWell actually I'm calling regarding the ballot initiatives in Massachusetts it's worth saying yes on one which the ballot initiatives in Massachusetts driven by put on the ballot fi I'm an effort\nFrom the Massachusetts nurses association and the nurses in Massachusetts trying to have legal um standards for staffing\nWhere hospitals ... nurse to patient ratio for hospitals for the sake of ... right\nYeah California's the only state that has this at Massachusetts would not be the second\nNurses' union most likely to\nWhile the nurses' union is the is the prime driver behind this year because staffing is just an on a legally you can have um\nLimits only in ICU patients so nurse has maybe one to two critical patience for that patient goes to the floor the nurse now it's taking taking care of six to eight sometimes can\nThen I Know I'd rather stay stats let's say patients do better when there are at least the minimum number of nurses a PR floor and suing the NATO Springs Florida getting going to get to do the last one so we got Fifteen seconds for your high\nYes yes I Am in favor of voting yes on proposition Thirteen advance greyhound racing and the state of Florida because of the abuse of the animals they guy they separate injuries so I'm ... years ago yes on proposition Thirteen\nThank you very much too in the new the Springs Florida and I'll throw in one last one I see the Californians will choose whether to stop changing the clocks twice a year\nI don't know whether they want to end standard time or daylight savings time uh but even if they pass it Congress would have to go along and so far I don't think they're ready Candace Norwood reporter governing magazine thank you so much for going over so many ballot initiative\nThanks for having me and thanks to everyone for listening to this edition of America on the line on Brian louder and I'll be filling in for Jonathan Capehart again tomorrow night talk to you that [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] leadership\nSupport for America on the line is provided by cameras and collective additional support is provided by the anti Casey foundation and New York public radio address to the doctor marrying white [noise]\nListening to end up news from Colorado Public radio one Ninety point one FM Casey of our Denver fourteen Ninety A.

so\nWhen your book in a weird city in the book or calls you and goes hey man I Need you to go do\nBlah blah blah Arkansas and you look at it on a map and you can see that it's I call it the blue line the freeway you know the freeways on like the atlas is a blue there didn't know that by the color blue\nSo I could look into about ... how far off the blue line the city was whether or not I was going to have problems and it looks like a problem city okay I'm going to go in that town late I'm a pull up right to the venue Dubai ... get my money and then I'm leaving\nWell let's hear an example of you on the Daily Show and this is this is really funny um this is from April twenty ninth twenty sixteen and you're doing I'm basically you're doing rap video\nAs if you were kind of Iran and all of the phrases in this are things that Donald Trump every ... yes yes [laughter] and so okay so that's yet\n[laughter] this is talk on the weather down there [laughter] when I started with me on the premise that my daughter differently they have all done doing the walk away\nThe Democrat in the middle of the month asked me when I Love everybody tells me out making ... or ... what do these letters lemon slum everybody loves tall\n[noise] rich part of the beauty I'm Brenna rich [noise] when they\nKnow the hospital [noise] area and a husband served on a track [noise]\nPerson drifted back\n\n[laughter] that is hilarious [laughter] okay um yeah ...\nUh you know we were we were just talking about how much Trump brags and it was just more of a you know like he literally has like a rapper he talks about his house his boat his properties\nAnd I started talking with Jordan Clapper who's a correspondent at the time and clever and all that I bet if we dug deep enough into his tweets we could find enough bars to putting into stances to make a full blown rap song and that's what we did and we comb through [noise]\nThe the word the Microsoft Word document was fought size twelve single spaced and it was about twenty pages of just quote in tweets in just anything ragged do shift and we just neatly went through and just found line by line and just put it all together\nAt the video still up on YouTube as far as I Am but there's Ferrari we hire models we the golf course we went way beyond what could have just been a three line joke if we just wanted it to be that\n[noise] so you ... know I started on the same day at the Daily Show who discovered you listen to Trevor Noah or John Stewart\nAh is Trevor Trevor in his people you know I at the time before Daily Show I'd been doing um I'd come off of his sitcom on TBS celebrated in song we'd gotten cancelled and so for that following year\nI was doing most of my TV appearances would guess rolls on ESPN on the you know various shows on their on their family networks so a lot of what you do on ESPN as a comedian isn't that different from the Daily Show you take the day's news\nAnd you find the punch lines and it's even more difficult at ESPN because\nYou can't offend sponsors and athletes in teens and the like there's just this more potholes and comedic humor with sports versus politics politics it's all in the gang you can go after anybody but\nSo much more manager diligent way of making jokes and the sports on that I guess I did well enough from that to get somebody violence rubber side and that I got to call for the audition and six days later I was in New York City\nThat's the other thing it'll tell you about the daily shows that when you're ... it's like yeah you star now like what my stuffed in California yeah that's

uh my neighbors would beep off in the blues and so they were open their windows you know it in Saturday's in the south that's you know that's cleaning day\nSo I'm eating Aaron Dionne Oregon Diana Ross and Ross do it for my mom's house or through my window the Lee family next door I could hear fats domino and you know some of the deeper southern blue stuff\nCan I ask you about the ... and if your parents work and what they did for a living or so I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama\nUh\nOn the west side the neighborhood is called west in the code three five to eleven one of the worst ZIP codes in the city in terms of crime statistics at the time [noise]\nA pretty rough neighborhood on the back side of the crack Arab backside of who we moved into west in on the back end of white flight so in the eighties we had a couple of white neighbors but you know by the early nineties and you know\nCrack it really taking over the you know it was pretty much an all black neighborhood the one thing I've kinda joked about sometimes but it's actually true is that\nIf you're going to live in gang territory it behooves you to live deep\nIn gang territory because where I Lived in Birmingham\nMost of the shootings were happening where territory's met like on the borderline almost so there are a lot of bad people but a lot of the bad stuff that happened in the hood happened more so on the outskirts areas in relation to where I Lived\nDid you ever consider joining a gang\nNow I you know my mom my parents were separated until I was in the third grade so when my parents were reaching filed and we moved to burn a mother and I left Memphis and went to Birmingham in an ad taking piano lessons I was playing baseball I was in gifted courses\nYou know when I was when I put on punishment and my mom would take my video games from me I read encyclopedias\nJust you know I really out of lack of better options but you know I was always a brainy kid I had leg goes and you know in gangs tend to benefit people that are type a personalities are people who strive to be a type a personality I was very aware of gangs\nThere was a housing complex South Park projects and they just built a new library\nIn the commercial district on the other side of the projects in the library had computer classes\nAnd my mom wanted me to take computer classes so\nThe quickest way to the library was to cut through the project and sometimes I got picked on and there and then there were days why didn't feel like being bother with that so you would have to walk around the south park project to get home which is a forty five minute detour\nAnd then you get home and your mom does where you began which you've been out there and so now you're getting accused of being out doing bad things and in actuality we're voting them but you know you can explain that\nTo people with the saving grace for me was that my parents are bought me\nA really nice basketball goal and there's a park up the street from my house or called powder Lee part\nAnd probably park had all the you know it was a municipal city park\nAnd he had all the hoops and you know it'd be bank is out there and proudly part set on the edge of gangs to disciple of vice low territory so sometimes it would go down so my mom didn't really want me around that element so I and I've never talked with her about this\nBut my guess is that her ideology was it the boy like shooting basketball let's put a basketball hoop in the yard and that way he won't be probably park if something goes down and it it's just I don't know if his fate or what math but\nWe had a house one of the few houses in a neighborhood with a two car garage\nWhich meant the way the goal was set up you could play almost half court if you played off into the dirt on the driveway so we basically had half court\nAnd we had the best basketball goal with a breakaway ram because of the city park the polls always break because they're arrested and crushed DNA replace them with other rusty and crush the rams so all the gangbangers came to our house to shoot hoops regulated ...\nAnd all that that come into play basketball\nBut so then you ask me what my father didn't advertise that okay my father was a radio personality in the city and I will respect that my dad was a civil rights journalists back in the sixties and seventies he was embedded in any any march you can\nFootage of I'm sure my dad is no more than two or three steps behind Dr King covering the march my dad did morning news on the radio my father was the voice of the city of Birmingham for very long time his name rank out and out of respect to my father\nGod's will leave guns around the corner they believe the liquor up the street\nAnd when they came to our house to switch so you might feel vice lord and a gangster disciple you if if it's plausible\nAnd there's no drama out of respect to my father and my mom my mom also due to smuggle anybody and I think there's something to show inches you know in my mobile bring ice water out like she was nice so\nI grew up in a bad neighborhood but a lot of good at a lot of circumstances in favor that kept me on the side of the wrong people\nMy guess is Roy would junior a correspondent on the Daily Show we'll be right back but first I Want to take a moment to urge you to support this station when it comes to news and popular culture nothing

sources of subscription based journalism\nThis young man and his older white companion are going to skate Barbados they're going to get out of there or did you need to get out of there get out of a slave situation as a novelist for your on Saturday\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel what it really wanted to explore was his life post slavery and to show\nHow [noise]\nYou know by being physically see we think of that as being kind of the end of sleeping well she's not in chains he's gotten away he's physically free but I really think that you know there had to be a huge psychological ramifications staffing than a slave\nEven while you were free in body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma and probably a great sense of the will to him into your place in the world and I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways that comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he was going to be recaptured her church tone or another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent that\nIn a way he resents being freed you resent the white man of freedom a obviously you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that I knew and dislocated up in a way\n[noise] yeah but I also think I think the main thing that he represents is the feeling that the men who freed him did not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free and yet he\nReally has the sense that do this man thought of himself as an evolution is and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a relevant storage of you and two thousand I think\nI think we're still dealing with a obviously a lot of the themes in concerned that come up in the book [laughter] things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some\nLives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people kind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um\nAnd how they [noise] they really had to [noise] not only is sort of\nChanged their own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very sort of ... an everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it wasn't going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize the whole society to [noise] to change public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky I'm there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas who brought up black people a couple of times and expressed baffled unfair centrally so I don't understand\nWhat it is the black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own life\nAnd that they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history that you're laying out and find that to be old news\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that to this exists [noise] um to me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch say\nOf um police officers gunning down unarmed citizens have anybody watch those videos and still contend that there is not a problem and and um [noise] that way of racial equality and fairness that this is baffling to me [noise]\nUh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of people wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do is to bring a reader in too\nThe characters experience especially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy in Eighteen thirties or betas a who's a slave but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you are like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him as he is going through these hardships if you can do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy [noise] se\nOr do drugs is the author of Washington Black a novel that's been short listed for

each night when you go in during the day do you find people human beings people who stayed there are trying to go back there\nYeah I mean when you go in you find lots of people who stayed through a

hasn't always been clear where you can find gas for your car\nSo uh they're stuck in many in many places and trying to decide to do we drive down this road for the most part the\nThe uh the roads have

they're stuck in their houses they can't get to a zones that where people can get relief are is the salvation army addressing that or are you are you seeing other organizations try to meet that need\nWell the nice thing is when it comes to a disaster of this scale one organization alone can can't do it and we're very thankful that there are such great other partner agencies a NGOs a local\nUh folks who are who are also picking up a big me up the slack in essence or to try to bring a relief and basic needs to to those in those areas you know I think there's\nFilter as off my sense\nIs that he's relying on some stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on\nTo make a statement about an issue that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on or doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment LA is certainly acceptable we want to get to the bottom of rivers are if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happen\nThat was Trump talking about to showcase disappearance saying he would be open to an FBI investigation into allegations against justice Kavanaugh\nAnd responding to a question about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the twenty sixteen election\nWhich leads

like someone's just\nTwist at the top off like a you know breaking off the top of a flower and ah so the destruction it it sort of like a ... some people told me it was like a tornado inside a hurricane and some places it dropped one house\nUh and left others standing with with no real explanation\nSo I Want to ask about something else will when we were talking earlier you mentioned that you can't stay right there on the coast there is no place that's habitable you have to back away from the coast each night when you go in during the day do you find people human beings people who stayed there are trying to go back there\nYeah I mean when you go in and you find lots of people who stayed through a inland rural communities I found people up there and they're concerned\nAbout trying to go to places where maybe eight is being distributed but they don't have that much gas in the car and and it hasn't always been clear where you can find gas for your car\nSo uh they're stuck in many in many places and trying to decide to do we drive down this road for the most part the\nThe uh the roads have been cleared of of down trees but ah every evening people like me and contractors of you know thousands and thousands of of a lineman cutting down trees and putting up power lines\nAnd they're leaving the city or to go to the only places they've been out of the fine to stay thirty forty miles out and the traffic just crawls or some of those people I saw were seemed to be residents who are leaving\nUm I saw a guy with a trailer or hauling a boat had everything he owned I imagine in it and I had to tell them it's some of his sneakers had just fallen out of the back\nBut they're also ah just thousands of these trucks of utility trucks every once in a while the I'm a convoy of

[noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday that would require drug makers to reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we'd need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific says advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different be depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to fill so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want list price up there which is I'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often um ads days are made a point of saying that the list price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing right consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or\nMight adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay\nIt could scary away from getting a drug right\nSo um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows at a ... price transparency and prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up to the minute and say in the form it from single industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group ... I made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nUm help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal up that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me ... is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the rules comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce that [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "16"}
