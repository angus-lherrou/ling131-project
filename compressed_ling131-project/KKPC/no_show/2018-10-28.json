wasn't just like the tune dirty readers and you know the class it was the whole class\nAnd appeal to a huge variety of readers but it did reflect every reader the three main characters in the books

historical narrative about slavery or civil rights\nWhat we do see a lot of with diversity are books like Harry Potter and that are just pure fantasy and in fact those are the kind of books that African American children for example really are clamoring for\nBut Horning is hopeful and just over the last couple of years there have been some breakout titles like last year's dread nation by just

of the shooting officials say Barry's made statements about genocide and his desire to kill a Jewish people us attorney Scott Brady said prosecutors are treating the attack as a hate crime\nA hate crime as an individual is animated by a hatred or certain animosity toward a person of\nA certain ethnicity religious faith and it it becomes domestic terrorism where there is an ideology that that person is then also trying to propagate through violence and so we continue to see where that line is\nPowers to set to appear before a federal judge on Monday chanted and sent NPR News\nPresident Trump yesterday suggested that houses of worship like the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood may have no choice but to have armed guards today the mayor of Pittsburgh William to do though disagreed\nI think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred drew murder\nTo do to a child reporters he doesn't wish to live in a nation or city were armed guards are required for schools churches and synagogues he spoke on

about bruising and marks on the child um he was coming to school in December without shoes on\nAnd he was removed from uh Denver public school and a few months later I'm starve to death basically\nIn both those cases the home schooling or sort of excuse who's used\nYeah and you know and there was no evidence that any home schooling took place\nNew alone is the only two states require background checks on adults who provide home education Colorado's not one of them a bit on the other hand privacy is a big part of this debate I mean if you spoke with James Mason an attorney for the home school legal defense association\nThat organization represents eighty thousand member families across the U.S including some two thousand here in Colorado and he told you quote\nHorrific cases create horrific law and says it's it's not fair to scrutinize families who home school because of isolated cases of abuse right well what do you say to that and I wonder what kind of reaction you've gotten to the reporting\nWell a lot of angry home schooling families ah who's but again this is not intended as as you know an attack on those who legitimately are home schooling their children\nOr you know his reaction and I and I think the reaction is indicative of this the standout a home schooling advocates have taken any time there has been\nAny attempt to to strengthen the laws are the safety net is that it's an intrusion it's an invasion of privacy and that it is not fair because the vast majority of them are doing it the best they can to to educate their children and have no intention of abusing their children\nAnd they should not be required to exchange their privacy for the safety of a very few\n[noise] it seems as though that a law might be narrowly tailored to those parents who withdraw their children from particular district and who have had cases are reports of alleged abuse\nWell a number of the child advocates I talked to seem to think that that would be a good idea that has certainly in the case of a child who has been\nUm the subject of an investigation regarding abuse that there should be some kind of automatic follow up with windows child children removed from school California tempted something like this but I think was not successful California attempted or after the trip in case they did um introduced legislation that would have required\nAn annual visit among other things an annual visit by some one outside the family someone who would be a mandatory reporter like a teacher or a a health care professional\nWith a child at least once a year and that met with fierce up position by home schooling advocates and the the legislation was defeated\nThank you for sharing your reporting with us thank you Karen ... is an investigative journalist who filed

Republican from Loveland he co sponsored the bill that passed the state legislature earlier this year it was actually one of his last accomplishments has a lawmaker he's term limited and won't be back at the start of the next session but so can I say senator ... that I can still say that\nRight up until the next to the to the next assembly is actually seated\nAnd unique I connected with one bird from his home duty I'm In and out to all Colorado lawmakers if you want some good will with radio reporters have a home studio\nI Believe that to anybody who goes to the prison system has a lot of strikes against them coming out of the system and I mean we loaded up with with so many barriers to bringing people back into being functioning\nCitizens licenses that you cannot obtain if you have a\nFelony on your record for example or firing obstacles as well yes I Believe in personal responsibility but I don't believe the government should be putting on a national obstacles for that individual to get back into society\nThis is not a big element of that but it is a component to put people back on their feet [noise]\nWhat do you hope that this says to someone and they're getting out of prison when they meet with their parole officer and they her about\nPre registration say and regaining the right to vote what do you hope that says to someone who would soon be completing a a criminal sentence\nOr two things come to my mind one I use the term redemption which I think it helps them recognized that they have paid their debt\nSecondly however you should give them that sense of responsibility which is essential for us to middle do the right scene when we are living in this uh this this land to freedom\n... what do you mean that it gives the former prisoner that sense of response\nYeah it's it's one of those components a of a living a good life if you will to to understand that you have a responsibility to look after the interests of everyone through your voting privileges or or a rights\nAnd it's it's not everything but it is one component\nFor giving people the proper motivation to do the right thing in their lives I you know again I don't think it's it's the cure all but I Believe it's a it's the right\nStatement that we make to that person coming out of the prison system okay you're done you're now citizen again and we're going to help you get back on your feet\nBy helping you I'm a registered to vote\nHow have you talked about this bill with other members of your party I mean have you said the same things we've been talking about about redemption and and making sure that people understand rights that currently exists what have you said to get them on your side well\nTo me and important component is\nThat to this is not a first step towards giving a convicted felon in prison voting\nRights because in Colorado if you're convicted of a felony while you're serving your sentence and that means either in prison or on parole you do not have the voting rights of a citizen that is a part of your penalty for having committed a felony in the state of Colorado\nI Believe that that's inappropriate points that should be kept in place and if if we wanted to change that I think we need to put it within the whole context of okay we are now reducing the penalty for every crime in the state of Colorado is that really what were intending to do here\nThere are again only two states that never remove someone's voting rights after a criminal conviction in Maine and Vermont people in prison on a felony charge invoked Justin Cooper the activists from the top of this episode wants to see Colorado move in that direction\nColorado has an opportunity to lean towards that full reign franchise men I'm a restoration of all rights right as it relates to voting\nSee we'll ... we'll hope to get there I think it's an opportunity for Colorado I'm to be a leader in that in that sense disliked Vermont writer Maine\nWhich means this truth this moment of bipartisan ... around telling voting rights to be a fleeting thing in Colorado so far it's focused on helping people understand when they regain their voting rights a future fight could be about something much bigger\nWhether they should ever lose that right in the first place\nCPR San brash on the effort to make sure everyone who can votes gets the chance to next time Sam explores voter\nNo voting security to make sure ballots get counted the hackers are kept at ... you can subscribe to ... wherever you get your podcasts and you can hear it Monday through election day here on Colorado matters\nAnd we'll be right back with a burning question listeners had after an interview last week about grief\nIs Colorado matters from CPR news\n[noise]\n\nMm [noise]\n\nThere's so many little bites of news you get throughout your day all things considered fills in the gaps between the day's most important stories so you get the what's\nThe last midterm election only about twenty percent of voters under aged thirty showed up at the polls and the wives can only say young people tend to move around a lot and so they all feel wrestling vested in local election here the bigger picture on all things considered every afternoon from NPR News [noise]\nVote for the good guy and against the backlash marijuana tax money are small cat an incredible mess it up for our vote yes on sixty four\nOkay so we took away from that\nIs pretty big and it said you know to construct construct new school to reconstruct our schools or something like that\nOK yeah something like that first thing to note is not all of the pot revenue goes to school about sixty percent for other departments most of dealing with the regulation of marijuana like preventing illegal grow operations and distribution\nAnd for other public services like jail diversion programs and impaired driving campaigns\nSo about thirty percent set aside for schools but wait if just isn't for anything schools really needs to stay open teachers' salaries whatever that they can't use it for a teacher salaries are textbooks or bus drivers or keeping the lights on\nSome other special pot sales tax does fund one time grant schools can use for things like keeping kids off drugs preventing bullying\nBeing literacy and a separate tax on marijuana growers is contributing to a fund for repairing in renovating school buildings fixing roofs and occasionally building new schools Christian Hoffman from evergreen gets it\nWas supposed to go to buildings repair new schools with my interest\nBut she and her friends see that in Jefferson County there's a half a billion dollar bond measure on her local ballot to repair and renovate old schools that's why she asked through Colorado wonders\nWhere is the marijuana and money from taxes that was supposed to help offset some of those costs yes\nIt's supposed to offset those tough but here's why it simply isn't making much of a dent for most schools the growers pot tax has contributed about forty million a year into a building fund that districts can only access if they can match the funding that means going to voters\nCompare that to the amount Kristen Hoffman's district just one district needs for school repairs a half a billion dollars and the amount schools across the state estimates they need to fix their building that is fourteen billion dollars with the case you missed that fourteen billion\nDollars a new school cost about twenty five million dollars so I just told you that the fund is about forty ...\nMaybe the marijuana tax would help pay for a couple of new school year across the state now this isn't to say just go isn't getting any pop money remember the pot retail tax that pays for substance abuse and drop out programs things like that it tell Hoffman Jeff cos total amount\nAnd just go has received two million dollars since the marijuana funding began this is less than point three percentage ... general fund annual budget point three percent\nOf their reporting on this story strikes me how people think this really thriving industry marijuana must be contributing scads of money it's hard to grasp how little money comes into school from ... so that could John ... your favorite pot shops\nWe have to round objects here I'm trying to experiment with him so we can visualize it so this is a chocolate chip cookie and it's delicious would further what can you eat this cooking yeah sure I'm a little against the carbohydrate thing but I Will I'm winning room [noise]\nLiving on the edge I lost my knife along the way which is a little concerned I Do have a pocket knife in my backpack I can to imagine the cookie as the entire kindergarten through twelfth grade public school budget and we're going to cut his life to represent how much of the budget\nComes from marijuana taxes severe slice cookie that is one point six percent there there was one point six percent of the total\nTo fly all the budget pie from marijuana taxes is like the width of a number to pencil one point six percent\nSo does that surprise you yes I I Do think that the surprising part which is completely understood is that I as a\nUser a regular user of marijuana and just seeing with my own eyes made the assumption it sounds like the incorrect assumption feet inflated suction that\nIn fact if you took all pot taxes the slice it makes up of the entire state budget not just schools is the width of a stick of spaghetti point seven eight percent\nLet's be clear schools are happy with whatever they can get from pot taxes but it doesn't fund what schools they they really need money for enough money to increase teacher salaries lower class sizes pay for mental health supports and by updated textbooks\nSo that's why you'll continue to see schools seeking money like measure amendment Seventy three that voters will see on the ballot I'm Jenny branding Colorado Public radio news\nNow if you want to know where all the money

amendments Seventy four asks voters to beef up private property rights by compensating people if something government does reduces their property values\nThe primary proponents are farmers backed by big money from the oil and gas industry meanwhile state and local governments are virtually in a panic over its potential passage\nCPR as Grace Hood takes a closer look\nThis year's drought has thrown the economic hammer down on farmer mark are ...\nWe had one of the toughest we crops we've ever had in our history yet a lot of hail that came at the wrong time and basically cut our harvests about ten percent of what we would expect\nIs about two hundred yards away at fruit cuts aluminum siding for a small shed are Nashville's around his water pumps [noise]\nSupplemental income from water sales is one of the few bright spots in earnest his operation he sells it to noble energy for oil and gas development or initiatives behind the push for amendments Seventy four\nIf the government suddenly answer restrictions that decreases the value of his water amendment Seventy four it would make it easier for ... to get compensated for his law when you\nTalk about uh taking to somebody that owns a home or owns a small business they they have a hard time making that connection but to a farmer takings as everything\nTakings happens one property is acquired damaged or simply reduced in fair market value by the government in addition to water the measure seeks to protect mineral rights and private property\nChad ... with the Colorado Farm Bureau says the process for compensation would play out in the courts right now property owners get paid one losses are between Seventy and Ninety percent he thinks it's time for new guidelines\nIt'll allow them to look back at that economic standard and say maybe there isn't just one exact number that we have to go forward\nWith is it appropriate to have a number that's below fifty percent\nI think in the depending on the scenario when you're looking at takings cases they are very scenario specific\nAmendment Seventy four got financial backing from the oil and gas industry as mineral owners energy companies could stand to benefit but the intentionally vague language is drawing sharp words from critics\nEvery few years we get a piece of legislation that comes along and his\nDemocratic governor John Hickenlooper slammed that proposal at a recent rally against amendment Seventy four he's part of a bipartisan coalition his comments were followed by Republican Colorado Springs Mayor John ...\nIt is stupid but I like to refer to as as a wolf in sheep's clothing\n... says the state and us constitutions already have sufficient protections for private property and the courts are already operating well\nThere is no exception and this language that the government is motivated by health safety and welfare the only test is argue diminishing the value of my property in any way\nSome say Colorado should learn from Oregon's experience twelve years ago Oregon voters put a similar measure in place farmers wanted compensation for a lot that they felt limited their ability to develop land they made their case around Ninety year old farm widow Dorothy English who wanted to build homes for relatives on our property\nAnd the ... which doesn't even about statewide planning process you can't do that\nBob cc oppose the measure but Oregon voters passed it\nStacy says there were unintended consequences vague language allow timber companies to consider plans to develop housing on undeveloped land rural voters weren't happy ultimately Oregonians cast votes on a second ballot measure with revised language\nThere's just compensation to them there's unjust enrichment and they should do something unjust enrichment\nBut the Colorado Farm Bureau just\nDegrees it says the detail required by Oregon's process has already made local leaders there consider how their development policies affect property values next month Colorado voters will decide whether to get state property owners new rare protection\nI'm Grace hood CPR news\nLet's take a deeper look now at what happened in Oregon you heard from Bob Stacey increases story he's a member of the metro council it's a regional governments in the Portland area and he's passed executive director of a group that work to modify the original measure and so Bob welcome to the program for stuff\nThanks for having me that there's been a very long fight in Oregon over property rights and that came to a head in about two thousand four\nWhen Oregon voters passed this measure thirty seven as we heard the face of it was a woman who wanted to build homes on her ex urban land outside Portland just briefly tell us how the measure was worded and what it did\nSure um measure thirty seven the the ballot title says government must pay\nOr forego enforcement when certain land use regulations reduced property value [noise] which is a pretty attractive premise and then the campaign for the measure featured Dorothy English Ninety year old widow\nShe and her husband had bought property outside of Portland in the rural area I'm back in the sixties and then discovered when it came time to divide and provide home sites for family members on that property that they couldn't do that because it was now designated for farm in forestry\nAnd along with other people who found themselves in that situation they supported organizations like Oregonians that action that one of the get rid of land use ... and a an successfully campaigned to repeal Oregon's ideas planning law or to a\nUnsuccessful elections in the seventies and one in the eighties and then under took a long term effort to advocate for property rights over\nA natural resource and farmland protection\nAnd so thirty seven comes about and as you described it it really gave landowners property owners to avenues one they could be compensated by government if something government did affected the the value of land or\nA ... if the communities didn't want to compensate I guess ... financially or they could say OK these rules don't apply to you\nProgram thinking\nAnd were pleased to have you on the show why did the flu season of Nineteen Eighteen become a global pandemic\nSo suddenly one of the factors that resulted in global transmission of this virus was it was really the time the era and this was in the middle of World War one and so there was a lot of movement of troops that was really sort of unprecedented for the time that really resulted in transmission are classics\nThis virus okay ah that kind of movement is probably is unlike anything the world is seen to the point that is correct okay uh well what made it spread so quickly beyond about\n[noise] yeah so this was um you know anytime there's an influenza pandemic it it means that there's a new influenza virus\nThat individuals do not really have an existing immune response to and so because of that people are highly susceptible to that infection\nAnd it can easily spread from person to person it also means potentially that people can have much more severe outcomes because their immune system has not seen that diverse ... previously it can really result in much greater rates of hospitalization or even mortality\nUh was Nineteen Eighteen the worst pandemic put it into some context for us\nIt is so it is known as the mother of all pandemics for a reason on so it is it certainly was I think the really the largest pandemic to this day that um the globe has experience so as you mentioned tens of millions of deaths occurred worldwide including deaths of course here in Colorado\nHow does it compare to the ...\nSo the black death a did have higher mortality rates but it was much more confined again going back to that idea that because of all of this troop movement um there were really cases that occurred across the globe\nSo as we were researching this topic we found that this pandemic really hits home for people and we were discussing it around our editorial meeting and my colleague Andrew you're Dukakis recalls the effect on her family\nMy father's side of the family were Greek immigrants and\nI'd always heard about the Nineteen Eighteen flu epidemic because shortly after they arrived in the U.S\nThe epidemic hit and um everyone was sick in the family my great grandfather died so did the oldest brother in the family um and I heard stories about carts being driven around towns and picking up dead bodies everyone was just terrified of getting sec\nWhat accounts have you heard\n[noise] yeah so there are lots of different stories that that occurred like come out of Colorado history books I'm so one um one particular community that but it's very hard hit was silver in Colorado I'm so silver ten obviously had a large mining population\nAnd during the Nineteen Eighteen pandemic it was really that population of twenty to forty year old that were hardest hit which I think it was a large percentage of the silver ten community the mining community\nAnd and during the pandemic their stories of\nOf you know hundreds of deaths occurring in silver ten I'm In one night alone ten deaths occuring um the city hall was converted to a makeshift hospital to how those people they didn't have\nEnough resources to deal with the body's I'm also stories about not having sufficient medical care there please and the city\nI'm really to have medical personnel sent to the town to to help says\nDid you find that there were big differences in how the flu hit different communities in Colorado and how they respond to\nAbsolutely so Gunnison is is a community that was really known as an escape community at the time so Gunnison things very differently from silver tenant other communities and Colorado\nI'm very early honest established some very strict quarantine requirements that they put up barricades to the city they did not allow cars to pass through they stopped trains anyone that want it to get off and gone and had to go into a force quarantine for several days\nI'm so schools very early lots of strict measures in place that that did ultimately protect the town it's kind of thing\nBut it actually works that it wasn't just a sort of fear mongering step\nNo absolutely well I I Would say that there certainly was the year ... there were a neighboring community that we're ... we're seeing very high mortality rates in very high um attack rates lots of cases occurring in neighboring communities and so I think Jonathan was very proactive\nOne theory is that the Nineteen Eighteen flu originated to just over the Colorado border in Kansas\nAnd as we've said than spread with the movement of us soldiers in World War one uh I don't know you'd think that they would have appeared in the coastal states you know maybe brought in by trends is you know the trouble what's this Kansas theory\nYou know so the Kansas theory um so so the the pandemic occurred in several ways largest wave you mentioned was the second wave the fall of Nineteen Eighteen but earlier in the spring including as early as of January there were documented cases cases that report it to the federal government\nThat occurred in the town of Haspel Kansas that were the severe influenza are pneumonia type cases that were very unusual to the the medical provider that what that was taken care of these patients\nAnd then we also know that individuals from that community then later on moved to Fort Fort ... know Fort oh I Can't remember the name of it for ... near Manhattan, Kansas okay I'm a military training facility where um\nWhere a large outbreak occurred in the spring and so going back to hassle Kansas one of the reasons that hassle Kansas has been targeted to not only did those early cases appear but\nHaskell and that area of the country are really part of a large migratory flight away and we do know that um there's lots of belief there's lots of research has shown that this virus really as of avian origin and so we believe that perhaps this came out of wild birds then was in domesticated birds and then transmitted to humans\nAre that's fascinating ah might be Fort Riley I think it was camp funds and Jerry ... still life recall which furiously Google help you out [noise]\nAh what kinds of responses to juicy in Colorado that that made no sense [noise] um because I think that there were folks taking steps that maybe weren't really helpful\nSo lots of interesting things on the bats were promoted there were recommendations to not eat meat there were um all sorts of sad and creams and lotions and things that you can imagine certainly um lots of fresh air was recommended a but a lot of the social distancing measures those measures that are put in place\nI'm really to prevent transmission were also haphazardly applied so things like\nI'm On street cars or the windows were required to be open but people complained and so then they closed every other window and things like requiring people to wear masks and certain settings but not other settings closing churches and theaters but perhaps not closing other ...\nBusinesses so to some of those measures were applied not universally and and I think to this day our understanding of social distancing measures that they certainly can work but they do need to be applied consistently\nNo I think of Colorado in this era so we're talking about Nineteen Eighteen we're looking back a hundred years to the global flu pandemic but I think of Colorado in that era as being a destination for people with tuberculosis ... the idea was that the the air here which is good for your lungs\nA wouldn't they have been more vulnerable to flu\nYes I think we we certainly know to this day that individual but chronic medical conditions including respiratory conditions are at increased risk for severe outcomes could influence so absolutely that population would have been a greater risk\nOkay anything we've learned from Nineteen Eighteen that's still valuable\nSo I think we've and we've learned a lot about um the immune response to to viruses and how novel virus it really can impact um populations you know there's been lots of work done to reconstruct this virus and trying to study the very on factors I guess he did with the virus one question\nIs could it happen again right that has to be in scientists mines\nYeah certainly I think we are always vulnerable to pandemics I think one of the one of the you know very I think helpful things we have now is antibiotics so a lot of the cases that occurred in Nineteen Eighteen we're\nI'm caught that influenza virus secondary bacterial in pneumonia and so we now have antibiotics to treat those individual we also of course have vaccine and anti viral medication\nSo lots of things now that time I think would\nI think decrease the transmission of fire\nSo it's the secondary things that people died from not necessarily the initial flu infection and what have people learn by studying the Nineteen Eighteen flu have even I'm perplexed as to how you do that\nYeah so there was interesting reconstruction of this virus really trying to isolate on DNA segments from individuals that had previously died of the Nineteen Eighteen fluent out of ... they were able to reconstruct this virus and and learn about how this virus you know differently than other influenza viruses really did have\nA strong affinity for the lower respiratory tracks that really did cause lower respiratory tract or pneumonia type symptoms and people perhaps more so than other types of influence have the ability to do\nAnd then there's also interesting um studies that have been trying to look at why certain age groups which means twenty and forty were particularly vulnerable to the flu\nOr would you you've you've entered that already in this conversation\nYes yes so so really we think that that population of twenty to forty year old had during the early childhood experience to a different type of influenza virus and that really influenced\nUm their immune response to the Nineteen Eighteen virus and really resulted in them having an ineffective R D is regulated immune response and made them particularly vulnerable than to secondary bacterial pneumonia\nHow did you study a flu virus from Nineteen Eighteen like how do you begin to map would it would look like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "28"}
