when I was a kid I thought it was the only one in America being raised by my grandparents you know and I didn't take any other my peers and my elementary school a great school had these sorts of problems\nAnd come to find out later I mean they certainly did so I Know I I Hope that dedication to young readers who are experiencing a similar\nA tracking life might feel less alone by that to know

her but my my grandparents made sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and so over the years we did develop a great relationship um we danced at my wedding you know she got to meet\nMy first two kids um but it was it was it was when my second child was born that she started getting into trouble again start getting arrested again and a loss you wouldn't say say as much it was it was pretty clear that she started using again and she certainly was\nA surrounding herself by some nefarious individuals but I did ... my last discussion that last time I saw her was about a year before she died and we we left to what she said to me I Love you and I always will\nAnd without missing a beat and I said I Love you and I always will um she she never really took ownership though of of any of the stuff that happens um she would often say when you're just going to get over it which is a tough thing to say to a kid or ... you sort of learn to move past\nThings but it's it's certainly nice when it's at least someone owns up to their poor behavior right which she she was never able to do\nWell ... thank you so much for speaking with us and for sharing your family story\nWell thank you so much

retired\nPerhaps that sounds like a dream or like winning the lottery not so people are doing this right now because of their own financial decision making they're sometimes called radical savers and they're part of a larger movement called fire financial independence slash retire early\nThe concept is pretty straightforward save as much as you can as quickly as you can\nNow what's radical about that well they're putting around Seventy percent of what they make into retirement each year\nCarl Johnson of Longmont a radical saver about six years ago he set a goal to leave his job as a computer programmer it's now been a year and a half since he retired and he's only forty three is that right Karl\nI'm actually forty four forty four okay still a nice time to say you've retired or perhaps for something or is it true that a bad day at work is what got you looking into this idea of radicals saving\nYeah that's absolutely true I had no idea that any of this was going to happen or my life would turn out like this I plan to work to sixty two are sixty five and then I had a very very bad day at work when I was thirty seven and I I hit on Google and\nAt school how do I retire early up came all these people who are living this\nAh obscure crazy life uh one guy said you'd quit work when he was thirty one at at first I kinda thought the whole thing was a scam this is the Internet who is this guy what are they going to try to sell me and then it turns out it's just pretty much a math problem you figure out how much money you need to spend\nYou figure out how much money you need based on it and you do some calculations and once you hit your numbers are that's it that's a very ... over simplification of it but it's it's just math\nWe'll dig into the math in just a bit but would you call this an impulse decision I mean we all have bad days at work\n[laughter] there was there wasn't impulse decision I made the sole decision to change my life and about the course of one hour I'm very thankful spouse went along with it but yeah it I I have to say it was very very stressful I lost ten pounds and that we do to stress\nOkay let's unpack the math just a bit first of all I have to assume you were making a healthy income to begin with and is that necessary to do what you did a I did\nMake a healthy income especially at the end of my career it did not start out that way my first job paid be thirty six thousand a year in the theater was making a little over a hundred thousand a year because you're into the six figures yes so I don't think it's completely this or it will make life harder but there's other ways to make money we made\nWe saw tosses as a side hustle so there's a million ways to make money in this economy\nSo how do you begin to put away is it roughly Seventy percent of your income in to savings what kinds of changes did you make in your life to make that happen\nYeah so I've always been a pretty frugal guy but we did make one big one at a\nAnd that one was we had a huge house to house it was almost five thousand square feet and we had a toilet for all four members of our family member in the home so the first thing we did is we weren't very happy in the neighborhood to begin with so we sold that and move to a much smaller house that was the main thing we had to do\nAfter that it was small two weeks like going out to eat less uh maybe travel heck and using credit card points to travel I'm In walking maybe not driving as much\nSo you cut your overhead by downsizing you're home you\nBut your fuel expense is I'm hearing and eating out which gets awfully expensive if you buy a drink with a meal especially sure and how long did it take you from that sort of decision points that you were going to do this to having enough money to retire and what if I may ask what is your goal ...\nOkay so Michael amount was a million dollars and no debt\nAnd with that in mind I already had substantial savings I grew up with financial insecurities so I always mixed up my retirement accounts so at the time I made this decision I head about six hundred thousand dollars saved up and it took me about a four years to accumulate the million dollars that I needed to feel comfortable with leaving my job\nOkay and the million dollars made you feel comfortable why that's enough of a pot of money to earn interest on that it supports you in retirement or what yeah that's it\nThere was a study that said once you can live off four percent of the money you have saved up in an average year you could stop where she'd so we figured out we spend about forty thousand dollars a year so once we had a million dollars we would have enough to leave what do you miss\nYour old lifestyle though oh like what is the sacrifice yeah I don't think\nIt's a sacrifice you know a a frugal simple life is a happy life I thought I Would be unhappy when I moved away from the big house but it turns out that the community and the people around us or what makes us happy as a if I had to pick one thing would be the camaraderie camaraderie with my co workers I enjoyed them\nAnd I enjoyed the core nature of my work but I can still do that and I can still write code and I still do that just on my own terms so\nThat's a key question whether or not you're going to like life in retirement I Wonder if that kept you up at night\nThey did that was the main reason I [laughter] I stayed at my work another year after ache humiliated enough money and it was because I was so afraid of being poured in looking back now two months later after I left my job I realize how silly though is I don't have\nA I probably have Thirty years of of life left and maybe fifty years of life overall and I'm never going to be able to fit in everything I wanted to [laughter] it's just not enough time\nAgain you have a wife and two daughters and I do and what has this meant for your family life they wonder also just tell you why I felt about this journey you had to go on together yeah I'll tickle\nYour second question first I'm so thankful that I have an understanding wife who trust me with a math but she also saw how stressed I was so she's like if you figure this out go for like trust you are with my daughters is made life a way better in the summer I can spend time with my older daughter knows with the ... 'cause I could\nOver the next few days we kind of whittled down\nAn immigrant story it's an immigrant San yeah\nYou and your brother or immigrant yeah right you were born in South Africa yeah my ... my whole thing\nAnd when immigrants my ... my best friends growing up early immigrants I\nHave so many perspectives on what it needs to be an American I see so many sides to it just because when we moved here everyone was just like just just on the easing America's incredible we moved in the height of apartheid\nSo it was like wow like this is an incredible place you know\nIt would have been such a stark contrast very yeah in through a lot of my grandmother lived there\nYeah my friends that moved from India at the same age and other places you know\nBut now I mean there's a lot of crazy happening\nI and I mean I we've been torn the whole\nWorld and I've seen a lot of different countries and it's not just here but the amount of racism and sexism and\nWe're not as as as forward is we out maybe talk\nAnd you feel that globally I feel like you know\nUh\nAnd show\nA\nWithin many songs as you had for this album how do you begin to whittle them down\nMust be like picking a favorite child\n[noise] yeah it's like picking your favorite weird children it was a tough process at first and then I remember it was like the spring starting my season my pharmacy them starting so I had a lot of work going on\nYou are a farmer in addition to being a musician\nYeah farm like half the year so I remember I was\nPlowing everything getting ready for spring planting I remember I had my headphones on and I would just\nI knew that the record wanted to start with birth and I didn't know why and I knew how I wanted to end and so I Would just keep plants on our alright I'm Mad Max next and then keep when something I'm not mad and then\nYou know forty four minutes for vinyl you know that's what we're always after forty four minutes we're going yeah twenty two each side pretty much okay yeah sometimes it can go a little longer left but\nI Want to point out birth is B.

T. and\nYou're listening to Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan water and we're backstage at red rock I guess in dressing room number three with Gregory Allen Isaac off the Boulder County folk musician his new album is called the evening machines and he's taking a few minutes before a sold out show to talk to us\nWe talked about caves one of the first singles from the new album the sound is lush as there are so often is it's huge and it strikes me Gregory as the kind of song if it's going to encourage people to sing with it\nMhm I I think there are a lot of backgrounds Vogel there are\n\nAll the way\nIt almost strikes me as like a a drinking beer halls so harkening back to a time when in union halls people would sing together\nDo you think that's that's right\nYeah I mean we recorded that there's like twenty people in their farm just singing everywhere\nSorting bizarre sing along\nYou know like a like a\nLike an otherworldly sounds like pretty bizarre story line but yeah that kind of anti Semitic feeling what is the bizarre story line\nFor me that songs about that kind of love of silent you know I wrote that was a great friend of mine Ron Scott I'm often we've written a bunch of songs together he came up to visit me from Austin\nHe's awesome bizarre character to\nYou know you'd wake me up in the grid I found I think I like birds and out found some in the field you know and the written down run and then I Would just follow him around the farm and just write down where they said and\nHad all these pieces of paper in front of us and we kind of wrote that song day\nHis friend was visiting from Saint Paul\nWe're driving her to the airport and the St Paul I've got a\n\nYou know I ... that you are able to write lines that are so short and so packed with emotion\nAnd in this song is where or inside it's on our own son\nShowed a charge on a shot\nAnd I just thought that ... to the core of what it is to be vulnerable\nUh-huh I remember reading that one because I was outside my house and it was like a full moon when I was a big\nBright and then we see like the entire guard and you've seen cheap like in the background you see their eyes all kinda lit up and I thought there's no high you can't hide in this kind of like you know and like you could in at night\nWhich is pure say yeah piercing but he's reading the liner notes and you give credit to someone for God noises oh yeah the heck are God well God noises\nYou know Jim effort in are you making records for a long time\nHe had a bunch of these old keyboard laying around and I was just like Jamie let's make some God Knows is just so I don't know like all of that but we just kind of going to he's like all the bad news on this you mix the gotten ... Jamie didn't work on this record but we kind of kept that language\nAnd see if the idea that these are the sounds that make it feel of cereal\nA theory oh you know it could be anything organic or analog sound\nYou can maybe throw back in the end of the mix are really far away or maybe to do some distortion or delay that maybe you don't hear on the first question but it kind of makes

meanings yeah do you ever look at what your fans are saying what your son's me\nAnd I haven't on maybe I'll do that I don't know you don't have to it might be cool 'cause I think that's the coolest

I think there is a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience with oil that ah the public sector for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north\nSixty percent totally in Norway said we don't want to open the most vulnerable areas in the north the different areas and are they also have pulled showing that people are willing to leave oil in the ground for climate reasons ...\nI think we're missing a a major part of the energy world energy debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out into ... look to China for example and I'm the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders so we have to look on a on a greater scale and I mean that's\nSince the weeds on oil and gas is one of the most green ones produced in the world well enough to come through such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because they're specific\nPoint that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat ah the photon islands is very important environmental area in the north of no way could be opened up to ... really important to marine life important but it's not something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very uh special area and the whole Silicon Valley of some ... tipping point as far as public opinions consent no I mean it's a quick or easy now because we have uh\nA political platform other government where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because we produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the is actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nCarry this because he is not the view that shed by much of the new region public that actually better that no way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from no way we take it out from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we had been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of felt that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing fulfill funeral in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum mellow as far\nAs you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it in places like the parents see in the up\nTo I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we actually have it and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate got submissions can come and says\nWell I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on cold in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about\nFirst of all my point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas or even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the vibrancy because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives\nThat are out there I think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... when I was next incident and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today I'm told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get our fault that feels good sunny stuff\nHamas the value of this country's exports of goods come from oil and gas I left like Elvis tuned who's noise environment minister it's the country's green credentials tarnished by the fact that they make an awful lot of money for exposing fulfill feels\nThe need to be in front on taking him to use the sewer mission solutions that are doing with the transportation sector I mean sending more electric cars than anywhere else last month and it was a close to fifty percent of the soup but at the same time\nYou know the oil and gas industry will become a smaller part or economy in the future so we must also have a policy for having a green shift\nWe've been to ... looking at the hydroelectric power plant that this is part of this project that led to a new way being dumped the green battery of Europe\nThe idea that this country can store power that's generated elsewhere in Europe and then send it back when supply from other sources sticky unpredictable renewable slumps how realistic is that\nIt is realistic for us to have to argue power here almost ... to ... park and with the European system so we are building and put them actors Baltimore's Germany ... England so let's we'd become part of it if our resources are large enough\nTo become the bathroom for Europe I think that his mouth us realistic only this summer to have the drought we'll be old from needed to import electricity from all the ... this is really connected the power will flow both ways\nDo you think the way in which no way has written if you like to who says you've convinced public opinion that is is a good thing to keep this oil and gas industry it's bringing a lot of money but at the same time you've managed to convince people that switching to hydroelectric power is a good thing where a green country we care about the environment\nHow long do you think you can maintain that writing those two very different horses\nWe are in the ... and that is not all male study is for the world to reach the purse agreement goals we how to make major change who sits next for a twelve years so we really have to do carbon us the U.S marshals as hard as we kind of soft us we can\nBut it's a little Hitler receive that isn't being challenged as it\nIt is a strategy for lowering emissions but it's also a strategy for a social change on an economic change is multiple a moral question is really about the hard politics so how do we deal with climate change of the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness also in the future\n[noise] that's the environment minister ... LVS too and he's in a hurry can fly on here\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to how to salsa and it had at the same time I don't think it's I ... I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not draw it out of all them\nVarious I'm interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable there's got to go it stops in ... in the southwest it goes all the way to the northeast of England and it's going to allow a new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs this in a sense ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've leveled about his role as a fossil fuel producer insider\nMay be I think it's really good for us that they are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can\nActually ended up more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make as much here as he can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted [noise]\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that we have been thinking about energy\nWe haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen the oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that we have to think about the way the use energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that actually if you want to be part of the European tuition than actually making more renewable energy it could be one of the answers to where we could put our money and that was the guy yet\nGay and when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople are worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas to do the ... they're worried that the ... they're going to pay to go up which suggests that people in Norway or just as worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to stay well\nOf course they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to use your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline to has given us a lot of energy and different forms\nOver a lot of years and that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in a way we have a lot of discussions above wouldn't move parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there\nSo it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern does huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're exported to power you don't use it for industrial production in no way the discussion above your work about where you live what you're going to do it's a problem there is\nI just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outsider called sudden now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local uh energy company or or the regional\nAnd we're actually looking at it together with the community is on the company is how we don't have to put another long cable to supply the but actually for a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think it's kind of way so creating viable energy future is it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits your own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars is it is in ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and checked because for a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the Fisher is now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan cause ... fault no no this is an opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though we we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the American sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have one I think you've made it out there I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't fit sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my\nAnd that is why I I truly believe that that shift and that turned ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that ... the speeds of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it close higher polls apps absolutely\nProbably have less oil and gas impact in the economy because you have to have to change\nThe Grinch shift is coming I think than technology will have developed so much that it will be\nGoing in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so critical to Baltimore is in there about the role it technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy in ten years well I think\nProduction is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas so I think it is going to happen by itself that\nPeople even though the projections are that it will keep going until at least twenty five she will be some sudden increase that's not the protections I Would say if you look at the expected production of oil and gas Norway is that it's tilted should three that they keep going up and then it type of something like that one I think that ... has\nProbably reached the peace now and then like yeah yeah what if that yeah the one they expect that that wouldn't be more gas resources to be found so\nDoes that mean that question here would be should we estimation politicians allow for the also the petroleum the gas industry to develop new fields for the future and that's something I Would argue against but but that would be a political question\nAnd and that political question how hard is it then for you if that's what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of their economic security within a decade that's not very long\nNo it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now in off the ... the oil price ... so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think the ... site it became more\nTo how vulnerable we are to dial industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think in that we can\n... do you believe that oil and gas industry will be there for quite some time\nBut what I'm seeing that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry is as well and we should try to find new ways of living that would also help the world that find solutions to the climate the to the climate\nProblem there is a ... a crisis could be the ...\nYeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in our with it sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera\nThat they haven't really realize the effects of climate change so more often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually plan for it\nBut we can't really hope for a climate crisis for Norway to uh to react\nGay uh passed on to the climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which Norway considers its dependency on on oil and gas and he is how\nHow we we we we have to remember the last eight years we we reached peak oil in two thousand or so we're ... production of oil from the last eight years\nSo we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing and with the predictions I see I come see the the one that just shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ... but then what does that make me give climate change look for new ways role in that particular debate but\nAlso started up where you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry scares right you've you've ... well we all lost\nEscape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle climate change and we're looking at three to four degrees yes it is and and I would strongly insists on that we need to shift\nThe economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas after twenty fifty so it's really a question of of time here and that's why I've come back to this is a political question because to me is the trolling resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is none of the hopeful ah for the oil industry in terms of the economics at guy it I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables will have that big a role\nCan she wants to come and yeah I mean of course there will be more renewables but also the road we'll requests more energy\nThat we have to look contact question has well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good hitter yeah I think the uh we'll we'll have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the ...\nFuture and in the long term as well and it will be necessary to meet the

America against liberal America what was the question itself in vain not just who to believe but whose side you want and this is such a major victory\nFor the White House it instantly gives Donald Trump a legacy within two years of answering the why has he has managed to get\nTo right wing justices on the Supreme Court and they should be the for decades to come long after Donald Trump has left

Donald was launching at them with a night and there's a lot of police shootings in Chicago so it didn't really make up ...\nBut there was a push to release a dash cam video of dance that came from activists and journalists and when that video came out it contradicted the reports that had\nCome from police and it showed that liquid McDonald was shot sixteen times including after he was lying on the ground and he appeared to be walking away from officers not launching them\nAnd now that they teach has come out and the police officers actually being convicted will kind of reaction has that in today's\nThe active as I've been able to speak to today are celebrating as they are pleased to see that he is being held accountable but they say it's not the end of the struggle\nThey say that they are looking to make sure that a few things happen that the police department do better training continue to hold officers accountable\nThere's also a separate case going on that's about the same shooting there are three officers who are charged with conspiracy for statements they made about that night\nAnd that's a trial that's going to get underway later this fault lines that something that I I think that the community is watching very closely has the police departments reacted to\nI haven't directly hurt from police department officials yet but we did hear from the police union which was not happy with the verdict not happy with the outcome\nThe lawyer for Jason anti gay expressed concern about what this verdict might mean for police behavior down the road in terms of instilled
