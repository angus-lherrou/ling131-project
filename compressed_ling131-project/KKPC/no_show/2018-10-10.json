Kavanaugh were placed on the high court\nCPR reporters with on road trips across the state to hear from Colorado voters what was on their minds leading up to this important election and we're hearing from two of those reporters now who are back from the road trips than to Brooklyn Grace Hood\nDid anyone else you talk to bring up the president's stances on social issues\nUh I talked with two Latinas I met them in sterling it was the end of a very exhausting day but you know it was one of the most memorable interviews that I did one had legal status the other was trying to get it\nBoth had experienced racism themselves and you know they really felt like a big it's had been emboldened under Trump\nElizabeth Hernandez can't vote right now and um she's in the process of getting US citizenship but she really said that people here her accent and we'll see things that are really mean right directly to her\nIt's like people people just\nThink that they have that right to to make people like her mother raises\nJust because that white that's why he's doing he's doing everyone hates everyone\nAnd Hernandez says that she really did not experienced the same racism under President rock Obama\nNow it's worth pointing out that Latino turnout typically lag whites in in elections and and the last presidential election Latino voters represented twelve percent of eligible voters\nNationally but only nine percent of the overall electorate on election day so I think it's going to be fascinating to see if the Trump administration's rhetoric and the crackdown on immigration really changes all of that\nBut you also talked to some people who feel the president's tone is dividing the country\nYep I touch a TA Taylor ... she's retired from the air force and she's now an attorney and lives in Aurora she's a Democrat and said she just never thought Trump would win the election she doesn't feel like he's ever going to grow into being president she actually never thought he wouldn't the first place\nI don't think in my memory that I've ever seen a\nPresident [noise] from the day of inauguration filed for their reelection campaign so that he can continue to have campaign rallies where's the speaking wall where the consideration for bringing us together but that's not that's not going to happen\nBut I Know you're reporting took you into Aurora which is really ethnically diverse part of Colorado what kind of things did you hear there\nWell there's obviously a big Latino population also a lot of African and Asian immigrants I talk to people from the south East Asian community and for them to the concern is foreign policy how the president is behaving on the world stage what that means for our country's relationship with\nDiplomacy and other countries around the world they also strongly support more visas for high skilled workers and worried that the length which Trump uses around immigration Cass it as something negative when they see a lot of benefits\nSpeaking a foreign policy we of course have learned this morning that Nikki Haley is going to be leaving the administration by the end of the year okay what big takeaways did you come away with when it comes to where people stand on the president grace\nEight so I think if someone who sort of covers politics and the periphery of the energy and environment reporter I really left this whole experience thinking that the president its future is super hands to the economy my sense is that voters are with him so long as things are good but\nThey could turn on him if we had another recession or if we start to see more negative impacts from tariffs he really ran on the economy so I think his political career could die if the economy hits a recession\nYou know we talked to such a variety of people from different ethnicities ethnicities ages you know parts of the state so it's hard to find you won overarching theme but\nUm if I can I say I I heard a lot of uncertainty and unease about just what's around the corner and that seems to be fed it by how dramatically the Trump Administration can just swing from one thing to another I think for Colorado is going to be really interesting to see if how\nPassionate feelings about the president for and against influence the races on this year's ballot at the state level governor ichi we had state legislative races that will determine control the state capital\nNone of that is directly tied to the president but he may be firing people up to vote and the local races just to be able to do something so a lot of dynamics at play\nYeah it'll be fascinating to watch thanks to both of you I Know you've covered a lot of mileage and we're grateful to you for sharing what you what your word makes things train CPR is public

the United states\nCould choose a thousand ever happen again we're going to lift the veil on calling races\nJim Clark does this for the a P in Colorado and by the way the a P has been calling races in Eighteen forty eight disputes with spirits and this Hi Jim hello describe what it was like during the two thousand presidential election when the a P made\nCall what kind of a backlash to the ... well\nFirst of all thanks for that intra [laughter]\nWhy don't you give me a paper cut and poor limited use I don't know it started with your worst moment yeah\nSo uh that was actually a a the fellow who made that call for the AP was a guy named Kevin Wall she since retired he was my boss for years [noise] ah the a P only made half a mistake\nWe called for Gore and then Kevin saw some transpose numbers in the county around St Petersburg and Tampa Bay\nAnd uncalled it and we never called again ah 'cause it was too close\nSo we felt pretty good about that we made a mistake we pulled it back and we never called again because as we know it ended up with what five\nHundred and thirty eight votes him writing that's right and of course it went through the courts an hours yeah not resolved for many us so to answer your question could have happened to again of course that could happen again have we learned lessons have we built in\nTechnological fixes and have we taken a deep breath and thought about this every single election cycle Oh yes we have\nWell maybe before we get to what has changed you can walk us through the a peace process for election calling it's really fascinating and it's very much\nShoe leather mhm it is so the Associated Press is the organization the one news organization in the country that collects and distributes all the votes to other news organizations the reason\nThe a P does it is we are the not the not for profit news organization owned by all the other news organizations in the United states and you don't want to replicate this 'cause it's very expensive on the order of aid figures every election cycle\nSo what we do is we put stringers in every county town city borrow parish that these are like freelancers yeah they're freelancers and pay him you know a hundred dollars for election night and a hundred dollars for a practice or a week before\nAnd they are calling in to vote collection centers we have three that run in the country and there's an army\nOf people who are punching the numbers into our computer network from the field from what they're hearing from these stringers ...\nFrom stringers and that gets distributed to a pie bureaus in to people like me who need to have instant access to the number so we can call races but it's also distributed to all the newspapers all radio stations television stations who are members of the pie\nAnd so when you hear on election night there's still a lot of votes out there there's a lot of them still or the idea is that there is probably a a freelancer as we said who's sitting in a county and has not yet reported those results because he or she hasn't gotten to the bird purchase\nConnected like happening in Colorado and sign up to get to look out in your inbox subscribe at yard idling [noise]\nYou're with Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar we had an unusual visitor this morning a robot and I promise I had nothing to do with picking its name\nHello my name is Ryan I Hope you are having a great day Ryan is designed to\nYour companion tested most recently with people who have dementia the robot has a human looking face it's basically a torso placed on a table there's an interactive screen on its belly and Ryan is capable of conversation green lights on the shoulders indicate it's ready to listen\nHi Ryan my name is Ryan to [noise]\nHi there Brian [noise]\nWhat do you want to talk about\nUm gosh our about politics\nPolitics is the art of this house and the art is the politics of the impossible [noise] more about politics\nSure are you a Republican or a Democrat I Am a companion that\nShe's a companion she doesn't express you go [laughter] [noise] and it was a joke [noise]\nWhat do you call shoes made from the skin\nHa ha [laughter]\nOkay that other voice is Ryan's creator Mohammed ... professor of computer engineering at the University of Denver\nHe left Ryan or waiting room and he was in the studio know Hi Mohammed highway look to see you again also with us is Sarah showed her wellness director at Eton senior communities in Lakewood\nWhere Ryan is being tested with some of the residents Hi Sarah combining Ryan Mohammed why a robot I mean why not a person what does what does a robot achieve that a person perhaps cannot\nUh so Brian is designed to complete meant human not to replace human to complement okay you have to hope humor like so right he's a socialist if the robot and what does that mean or what is the robot add also so robots or so as you may know\nThere's a shortage of caregivers now in the country and the social robots like Ryan can help caregivers like Sarah so if they don't have time they're not available so she can take care of a people will be dimensional images he's under pressure\nInteresting so this might actually be addressing something of the worker shortage ah when you were starting to think about designing a robot to help seniors what what problems were you trying to solve\nExactly the same problem the shortage of caregivers actually and also the other problem that had been working on his depression so many of these people with dementia all eyes are isolated you're depressed and ah they may not the result you know what his visit them\nDuring the day or so and robots can be a companion for them so they can have conversations with Ryan and\nThe conversation can be very interesting and funny\nAnd I have to think that a robot might be more patient Sarah than a person and so if someone with dementia is perhaps repeating something or asking something for a fourth or fifth time a robot may respond differently to that\nYes right and that's correct so with the robot on robot tries to propel the conversation forward kind of helping them to go to the next subject matter and so it also is more patient but it also helps to create that conversation and get that person talking beyond that point\nYou give me an example of an interaction that you witness\nYes I have that so I've actually had the opportunity to see many many interactions with the robot I'm going to tell you a little bit of a story about Hugo um he was one of the residents I didn't expect to be successful with the robot but he was experiencing loneliness and depression his wife had died\nHad moved into our community and I sort of became empty\nSo we uh signed him a robot um he agreed to do a little bit hesitantly but he did and we saw that Hugo started to interact with the robot on a regular basis he\nWould often times refer to as a very nice lady and she talks to me when no one else will um he'll go and his sister would spend hours each evening plane and laughing with a robot it would ah play jazz for them that they both enjoyed\nBut he goes I'm sister also came and she loved to tease the robot and so they would have an evening where there would be laughter interaction and um it also gave Hugo 'em a chance to interact with others outside of the\nHis immediate family many people came to see him and visit with him because he had a robot\nAnd so it it helped him create a sense of importance\nIt's interesting you say that Hugo was not someone you expected to have done well with the robot why\nWell he was a little bit quieter um he stayed in his apartment he loved to go attack ... interact in our community but he couldn't remember\nAnd so um he just kinda stayed at home and just kind of kept himself and so I wouldn't talk to him and I believe that he agreed because he'll go really liked me and so\nAs we came to find out he was one of these people that just really really blossomed from the robot\nInteraction now I understand someone was in tears when the robot was removed that you go\nYeah if you believe in his sister both cried when they removed the robot\nLet's talk about those sorts of tasks that the robot can engage in as well so Mohammed I I think it can remind folks to take medication what what else is the robot capable of so you can have conversation\nWith Brian as long as you want a different topics and matters can remind you to take your medications or go to events and also we can play cognitive games so it can to simulate your brain so that tablet that underbelly or\nThe gist of the robot you can play cognitive games with that as well so it's a bit like an eye bad on the abdomen of the robot correct that opens up the world to go to games cognitive development as you say how important do you think it is\nThat this robot has a a kind of soft human face\nI think it's easier to make that eye contact I feel like when I'm interacting with Ryan because she's looking at me and she's showing expression and she tracks me as I Move around the room I feel like I'm let's say any human being\nWhat other uses do you think there could be for Ryan and Ryan's successor because the diversion that you can see for instance on my Twitter feed right now at CPR Warner\nThey think is is one version older but where where do you see this headed Mohammed in terms of robots as as almost caregivers\nSo uh I think in the very near future is going to be in the market than many people are going to use it\nAnd you're adding will constantly working on adding more technology and more features to Ryan like for example they can play I mean that do tai chi dance or yoga\nOr a robot could teach you to do some tai chi yeah absolutely because then the next generation the arms of there are going to be active so she can move their arms as as you know just shared and also dancing\nSo when I see is our our movement in an aging instantly call aging in place people want to stay in their homes but they need supportive services and I see Ryan feeling that blade or the ... the robot can like by engaging exercises do men minders\nI'm helping that person to be able to stay independent and stay in that home setting that they desire\nAt what cost though I mean how much does Ryan caused\nThese days so it costs about nine thousand dollars to build a robot however that's not a business model that the um in mind Soviet nine two people are going to be nice for a price\nSo least robots yeah ... what's the biggest uh obstacle or failure you saw in one of ...\nSure um you know I Would say that we saw more successes and failures we found out that one of our residents had hearing loss and so there was some challenges with the technology\nAnd also to see love to garden so she was never home so we realize that we had to kind of look at who might benefit in some of the challenges but then the team work to overcome those I Can't see that we really saw any failures\nWell thanks to both of you for being with us it was fascinating to me you and especially Ryan who whom you refer to as she by the way [laughter] yeah there's a a gender listen as to Ryan Ryan as a unit six me okay thanks to both of you Mohammed or created Ryan to the robot to help with\nDementia patients more is a professor of computer engineering
