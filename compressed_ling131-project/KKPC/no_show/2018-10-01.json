games and false hoods things that marred the twenty sixteen election campaign NPR's Tim Mak has been asking how people can protect themselves\nThe online social media world in many ways is an illusion\nThe Senate intelligence committee recently heard from an expert who testified there is twenty five to thirty times more fake information from automated accounts on the extreme left in the extreme right then there is genuine real life conversation\nAnd with the mid term elections just around the corner experts are bracing for a spike in foreign disinformation we're going to have an October surprise that spread brewing who during the Obama administration worked at the national Security Council on how to respond to Russia's efforts\nTo spread false information during the invasion of Ukraine is\nNot a question in my mind of whether it's going to happen it is a crushing only of when and how large\nThe government and America's intelligence agencies have traditionally been more capable in tracking cyberattacks and espionage\nBut the Russian online influence operations during the twenty sixteen elections were done All right there in the open something that caught American spies and law enforcement off guard here's Victoria Nuland a top State Department official during the Russian interference campaign and twenty sixteen testifying before Congress\nThere was a tendency in the U.S intelligence community to look only at classified information so we were as a government not us aware of what was happening in the private sector\nNow Americans won't be caught off guard like they were then but we still need to Wade through the sludge of our online news environments and be smarter about the information we read and I'd just here's April ... who's the head of intelligence law at the national Security Agency that's been\nSocial science research demonstrating that\nIf I tell you some really outrageous proposition something that's clearly an chair I tell you you know it came this guy's green today the first time I say to us it's the dumbest thing I've ever half\nThe next time I say you're going to be more inclined to believe that and by the third or fourth or fifth time it starts sounding almost possible\nA big problem is the nature of the Internet which allows foreign actors to pretend to be American spreading real information here's Kevin Mandiant the c._e._o. of cyber security firm FireEye\nIs an unbelievably complex challenge for a free society especially with the anonymity of the Internet to really police you know the ideas that you're reading the ideology or reading and who are true source of those ideas are\nRafi Krikorian joined the Democratic National Committee and twenty Seventeen to be the lead on cyber security and has given some serious thought about how to combat misinformation\nWhat I Would tell my father to do is like do affect really just look for a living on the view should understand what the opposition to a point of view might be in like a YouTube added in putting your own head to try sort through what's going on\nUltimately the biggest recommendation from experts in online disinformation campaigns is to diversify your new sources and remain skeptical\nDetermined that we use is digital resilient that's ... who leads the Atlantic council's digital forensics research lab of a degree of critical thinking where if you see something that's overly a motive or\nYou know doesn't seem quite right check to another source just do some basic kinda legwork on your own to say okay well that could be right it could be wrong and just have a degree of skepticism on what you're seeing on line\nAnd if there's one thing about which there is bipartisan consensus in Washington DC it's that foreign actors like

Palestinians today I've traveled going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that is Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter different like he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say two states rather than going into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement is with the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us\nKeep our the must not be in their hands is the question of security in the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm\nWe're both Palestinians and Israelis blue Israel must return the overriding security responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left and basically militant Islam came in under\nBy law observing through on or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing off do if you have a state that of most of sovereign state\nBut not the ... security is that if they are not a state I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position a bit of a very very clear\nBoth to the previous administration under the Trump\nAnd well let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago when a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state's label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there is not an either or model I think we have a third model very leave which is uh basically all the powers of ...\nDo your duty all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which was littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something else you know you've got to Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians\nEqual rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israeli citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights in their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government going flak have their own\nWell then I'm like no but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin or no blue governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd or where the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have a lot\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism was back well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good\nI'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off but here's how it's done we have say intelligence about uh uh terrorists in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the\nPalestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers are we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk\nWithin attack because we weren't the un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also\nYou know attack us find internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very brings hope you got the irony of what I said\nI understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel is at a bipartisan support in I Believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that a few that we could have agreements and disagreements with\nAdministration was for example we had you know it's no secret\nOf out of disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we've signed an animal you\nAre in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and yet have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nBy minister and that was always a pleasure talking with you thank you\nVery much factors do good to talk to\nIsrael's Benjamin Netanyahu we also invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to join us and that invitation remains

Steve Inskeep we've been asking the prime minister of Israel about a Palestinian state subject returned to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably just state is more likely but you know what if they do seem do if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy it they're not happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them is Israel or Palestine or has some other science fiction name\nThese are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity is parity in which they fulfilled themselves as individuals as groups in every possible way that any American or British press that our Chinese person wouldn't well\nPalestinians today I've traveled going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces the demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that is the Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say two states to get into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement is with the Palestinians should be able to\nHave all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us to keep power that must not be in their hands\nIs the question of security in the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm\nWe're both Palestinians and Israelis live\nIsrael must return the overriding\nSecurity responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left and the basically a militant Islam came in under by law observing to Iran or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them or do we do if\nYou have a state that has a most of sovereign parts of the state but not the power of security is that if they are not a state I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position I bet it very very clear both to the previous administration under the Trump and\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago in a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that they're two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them fold civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there's it's not an either or model I think we have a third modeling very leave which is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which is littered with failed states\nThat's often the best you can do to try to do something of you know you get a Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation in prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to a question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians\nEqual rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament now their own government going flak have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin or no blues are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel now this is a very odd thing where the Palestinians are demanding\nSomething that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time that they do so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see\nThis is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in the west bank well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm\nGoing to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off but here's how it's done\nWe have the intelligence about I'm a tourist\nIn a one of the Palestinian and we would call up typically elephant scrutiny with orders and for water to take care of 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers are we don't know why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the\nWithin the taxes we weren't un by President Abbas so\nThey want us to take care of their security but also\nYou know attack of fight internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very brings hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely allied with President Trump that has carried certain grade benefits for you\nIs there also a risk and being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael has bipartisan support Israel is a a bipartisan support and I believe will have a ... in the future it's powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that you know you see that we could of agreements and disagreements with ministers were ...\nYou know it's no secret of out of disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we find a minimal you\nAre an animal you are the memorandum of understanding going for you to do a very important American security resources for the coming decade or so we can have disagreements and you'd have a basic agreement about the importance of our large\nPrime minister Netanyahu it's always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much\nFactories good to talk

President Trump is celebrating a new North American free trade agreement Canada last night joined the United states and Mexico and this new trade deal and the president spoke about it and the White House Rose Garden today\nThe agreement will govern nearly one point two trillion and trade which makes it the biggest trade deal in the United states history\nRather than continuing to talk now with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley has come over to talk to us about this I just got good to be with you Steve how is this different from NAFTA well\nThe name is different for starters the president puts a premium on branding and he wants to re brand this trade agreement as the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nThat doesn't become an acronym as easily as now he doesn't quite\nRoll off the tongue I work on the pronunciation but when when NAFTA was negotiated a quarter century ago there was a carve out for Canadian dairy for example protectionist measures are were left in place for Canadian dairy even as trade barriers generally between the U.S and Canada and Mexico were lowered\nThis a new agreement does away with some of those protectionist measure so it will give a American dairy farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market\nIn exchange Canada got something it wanted which was to preserve a an arbitration system for trade disputes with the United states and they very much wanted to preserve in which the Trump Administration want to get rid of\nOkay so there are some things here that Americans can celebrate people selling agricultural goods to Canada might be very happy with this um there are labor provisions on the Mexican side right there with prop up wages in Mexico and therefore hypothetically in the United states\nThere are new rules of origin for automobiles which will require that more of a car be made in North America in order to sell duty free in the United states and in particular require that more of a vehicles content be made
