N. F. treaty says quote nuclear war would have devastating consequences for all mankind it was considered a critical step into fusing Cold War tensions when president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed it in Nineteen eighty seven\nNow three decades later President Trump says the U.S is pulling out\nRussia has violated the room and they've been violating it for a minute here Trump\nAds now the U.S will have to develop those weapons unless China which has been producing its own arsenal unchecked and Russia agreed to halt their program Russia's deputy foreign affairs minister says a U.S withdrawal would lead to retaliation Amy held NPR News\nA procession of thousands of Central American migrants is still trying to reach the U.S even though many Hondurans who've been stopped at the bottom all the Mexico border are now returning home others have crossed into Mexico by swimming or rafting Emily Green reports from the border area\nAround four thousand mostly hundreds of migrants reach the Mexican border this past week but they couldn't get in and had nowhere to go now municipal officials into Qunu aligned say about twelve hundred have signed up to return home they include twenty seven year old John as far as\nWe mark ... says they couldn't leads the American dream which they all wanted to turn around because the situation here is really tough\nThe Guatemalan government is providing free transport for the hundred migrants still the caravan continues more than a thousand migrants appear to have made it into Mexico and are going to start that journey north for NPR News I'm Emily Green the corn Oman Guatemala\nJordan says it will not renew Israeli leases on two tracks of land along the country's border the leases are part of Nineteen Ninety four peace agreement NPR's Jamie Tarabay reports Jordan's King Abdullah says he now wants full sovereignty\nJordan state news agency quoted King Abdullah is saying he had decided it was in the best interests of Jordanians to end the lease agreement the two areas how poor and summer or a few square miles of agricultural land used by Israeli farmers\nThat the Trump tax code actually means a tax increase for most people's state income tax\nAnd in fact will be bringing in almost nine hundred million dollars more a year according to the state government and you think that should be tapped for roads that on some of it should be we see how much we starve roads over the last Twenty years we need to re prioritize when when\nI look at both prop one oh nine in one ten another difference I see is just the amount of money that would be generated a what do you say John Caldera to those who complained that that one oh nine is just a drop in the bucket\nIt's not a drop in the bucket it is a serious amount of money to jumpstart the most critical projects and they'd be really clear concede this is not a silver bullet\nOr nor is it a a unicorn bullets are like twenty or one ten unicorn bullet I always have never heard of that I sent her image I was gonna say Christmas tree was\nIt is a doable amount my sense is that people are not ready for a state wide tax increase they're usually not they usually go down very strongly so what is it that we can get done immediately and that's where one oh nine is all\nRight and on one ten Kelly ... to this idea of the sales tax increase you are hearing from mayor is like the mayor in Colorado Springs he says listen we've already passed some local taxes to address our own local transportation needs\nAlong come to the states perhaps with its own tax increase and the burden is just going up too high in our specific community would you address that concern for us\nYeah you have two huge issues first rural Colorado local communities there are not going to be able to on their own solve their transportation needs\nThe and why would we in the metro area care about that is because we have a workforce who cares about getting around the state it's part of the quality of life we sell here\nAnd if you're going to fix the system you have to fix it not city by city and hope everybody comes up with their contribution but you have to fix both the state system\nAnd the local system do you have any concerns that the tax rate is getting too high and some Colorado communities so our tax rate when you combined those state and local is still very competitive or in the country\nUm and so we don't have concerns about it are greater concern is our failure to invest\nIs impacting us greatly a study was done Ryan that shows each of us today is paint over two thousand dollars a year in use using more gas because we're sitting in traffic damage to our vehicles because of the condition of our roads more accidents two thousand dollars a year you talked about impacting working families\nThis small increase in sales tax will help reduce that cost chunk out of there are there's\nNursing personally so that at a Twenty one percent jump in our state sales tax is no small amount it is a serious investments\nI I I haven't done the math on the fly is that right twenty now and that\nIs wrong what you're paying sales tax this'll be roughly about seven or eight percent what you paying sales tax total heart\nCurrent sales tax is two point five percent on the state level besides another point six to that as an increase of Twenty one percent\nIn any way you cut it it means that places like Boulder and Longmont and superior will be paying nine percent\nOf the same thing down in Colorado Springs which is why mayor is like the one in Jamestown and all over say wait a second this could hurt our ability\nLocally if we want to raise more taxes for local mobility local projects for seniors\nLocal safety projects and by the way let me I I Want to consider a couple of things we both agree not enough money is going into into transferred yes that's right and I also agree or something that Kelly said often is that there's a problem with our way we tax what we do right now we do mostly on the gas tax\nAnd uh as our cars become more\nEfficient that means we're not getting as much back so we're you know\nYears since the gas tax increases let me just say that you're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner as part of our mid term election coverage we are debating a politely discussing\nPropositions one oh nine and one ten on your ballot they both have to do with transportation they take different approaches and junk how they're all notes\nTopic can we talk through just briefly like I'm ... ... voter confusion or perhaps even voter generosity like the idea that one of these might pass both of these might pass neither of these might pass a I mean in many ways you have just doing measures here John\nI think it's more likely that neither would pass than both would pass it both words faster than terrific we've got lots of funding for lots of things\nI have a feeling one or the other will pass and giving a history of tax increases statewide and polling not only from I'm not away from\nThat we've done but also polling that groups like the Denver chamber of done with parents group we have seen that this was not a very popular proposal but we'll find out on election day and we can vote either way I'll give you the last word\nCan we ... we have done a lot of polling in research or our initiative prop one ten is built around what voters value local control money coming into their communities and identified list of priorities Twenty years it goes away the biggest projects that improve their quality of life and voters have consistently told us they like this and support it\nThanks for being with us both of you thank you Kelly ... president of the Denver metro chamber of commerce she heads a coalition in favor of prop one ten to raise the state's sales tax for transportation John Caldera heads the libertarian independence Institute\nHe supports proposition one oh nine otherwise known as fix our damn roads you'd would raise three and a half billion dollars in bonds and repay them with existing state funds\nIt's Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar they often look like bird houses but they're filled with books there are more than five hundred little free libraries in neighborhoods throughout Denver alone\nThe idea for them came from Todd bowl who passed away Thursday at the age of sixty two he had pancreatic cancer let's listen back to my conversation with both from last year he was in Denver to declare it a city of distinction welcome to the program\nHello thank you very much how did the idea of little free libraries come to you it will ... was just a a when my mother passed away I couldn't I couldn't print off when she was dying that couldn't cry enough can scream enough and so\nAt her funeral I gave away a little necklaces to June a bowl of dancing spirit Nineteen twenty seventh through\nAnd it was based on an old sue Indian saying that nobody really ever passes into all they've touched are gone and so what it was it was a dance of my mother to the community so I put up with this a little schoolhouse one room schoolhouse that are\nKind of mimic to where she taught as a as a teacher so she was a teacher yeah and then I put in books that you that you'd had over the years that she passed back and forth with family and I felt it was kind of a gift to the community to celebrate that spirit of who my mother was\n... so in some ways do you see each little free library has\nA version of your mother continuing dancing dancing absolutely um I seats\nFiber is like one of my kids and I see each one of them is a dance of my mother around\nThe planet you call people who put up little free libraries stewards and are there more than five hundred of them in metro Denver I guess making it one of the most active regions in the country\nAbsolutely Denver's been absolutely wonderful ah they embraced it as art they've in braces community\nThey've been raised to as a ways of giving back to the community social justice\nThey've done all kinds of things and I've watched him for years and we've been absolutely impressed what happens and we know that the five hundred you have today in a couple of years will be a thousand so we we feel that it's becoming a part of the fabric of Denver and that is really exciting to us\nA thought crossed my mind as I was walking through the neighborhood that the people who live there likely had no problem accessing books you know there's the public library\nOr where I was walking they were probably well heeled enough to buy a book if they needed one like what what role do these play what do you see is the the mission of little free libraries\nWill uh I Believe one that everybody has a right to read and then everybody should read and and our long term goal isn't twenty thirty five that we write a book titled we all read weld together the history of the grassroots literacy movement\nAnd what we do is write a chapter every year in Denver is a big part of that chapter in the idea is that we don't have enough resources really to you know make the difference we need to make totally so neighborhoods step up and help educate and help with literacy of their own community [noise]\nAnd do you find that these little free libraries appear in all kinds of neighborhoods are in more upper middle class ones like what what do you know as you look\nAt their distribution I'm ... about eighty five percent women women mothers are the key drivers of little free library\nAnd what happens is they listen to it on a public radio station like this or read it in the newspaper in upper class higher social economic neighborhoods start and then what happens is it starts to work its way to the community starts in ending up at the apartment trailer on you know the schools\nAnd so what happens it starts out more social economic higher levels and and then it works its way throughout the community\nTo all levels than you've seen that in communities around the world I guess Detroit\nCleveland Minneapolis St Paul Los Angeles\nEl Paso Phoenix in New Orleans on and on is it data driven like are you looking at ways in which data can tell you about where they are and where they need to be well we have a world map and the world map is somebody uh signs up with us it's a sign that are specific number\nAnd they go up in the world map and when we know are they are and then you can look at the world map anywhere you are going or traveling and go visit a little free library\nWe know that they need to be really everywhere and we find out at higher social economic neighborhoods it's more about building community in connecting community and the lower social economic neighborhoods us more about literacy and building reading\nUm I opened one little free library and there is quite the hodgepodge a biography of the late jazz singer Betty Carter and adventurers guide to Hawaii there was a children's picture book do these though in some way become our final resting place for books that people want to get rid of\nWhat happens is people often um their book lovers and book lovers tell us all the time that books are my heart and soul they do find my humanity to find who am I Can't live without books and they tell us all the time this is a natural extension of who they are\nAnd so the little free library becomes really a part of them they start out by doing just what you said is arresting ground for that something they want to get rid of the ... and it turns into the most intimate experience in the community because what happens\nIs you're sharing of your heart and who you are and what happens is people start sharing their best and most important books to reflect themselves to the community and\nFor those unfamiliar with what these look like um [noise] they they are kind of school has like or bird house like that really everyone who Iraq's one does it a little differently what are some of the Internet like wacky or designs you've seen\nBoil everything from rocket ships to you know we see things that are out of old ... old microwaves we see 'em on microwave old microwave old fridge raiders of computers you know people turn almost anything they can imagine into a little free library\nWhat is your favorite story about someone encountering a little free library ... I'd probably my favorite story was a I got approached by a ... the former governor Jim Doyle of Wisconsin He kept me on the shoulders he's where you're from right right yeah Scott's and\nAnd he said you know tied you said I have to tell you my wife and I love little free libraries and he said and I want to tell you what's going on in America I said that's not who we are right now he says this is not we as Americans we're not this device if\nWe're not this polarized you said a little free libraries\nIs more about who we are he said we reach across the aisle we reach across the street we pick each other up we help each other we don't care where they're from we want to make their life better he said ... little free library is more of a reflection of what Americans really hard and so uh that touch me deeply in\nOne more is that a man came up to me and he said after presentation\nLittle free libraries understand them it's like air conditioning and I said well you know what do you mean do you how so yeah and he said well when he was a kid he's sixty something\nHe uh the parents and his grandparents read on the\nDeck or on their porch they played in the streets with the kids and the sidewalks and you know the fields and then they got air conditioning they went in the house just shut the windows shut the doors they turned on the TV and he said and it was all downhill from then in the digital divide began and he said but it's been over fifty years\nAnd with little free library we're talking again\nThey're they're connecting again with the neighborhood around them it does strike me as kind of beautifully analog you know little free libraries in the digital world and it's outside for that matter are you a steward that you have a little free librarian in front of your home town ... several of the first\nYou know he was the first one yet [laughter] that that would instill standing still standing and I also have the thousands one that I put to make that is on her and my dad when he passed in that one I have a music box you open it up and he plays to dream the impossible dream which is kinda cool you're very poetic\nI think we're all passionate at heart and I think that all of us have that a passion inside that we just want to come out and one of the things about\nThe little free library which is the dance of the community and you find out how many people are really caring and really caring about their neighbors\nTodd Bowles speaking with us last year has he designated Denver a city of distinction for having more than five hundred little free libraries both died Thursday at age sixty two from complications due to the pancreatic cancer\nColorado matters from CPR news\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo in a room one forty nine year old female she's a mother of three she's\nDying from a rare sarcoma [noise]\nShe had to decide whether to continue chemo or\nSo I brought in a social worker and the ethics committee to help her\nAnd also lined up the meeting with a chaplain\nShe just said she wanted someone to pray with during all of this [noise] sat with her for a long time today in just [noise]\nShe's having a really hard time to be honest [noise]\nI think I'm going\nTo get to a bit surreal after that we're we're like go in the hospital I Know you're limiting the number of people can be in any one show\nYesterday guests are allowed and you will go into all these locations in the hospital that most people will never go and the patient so you go into the basement we go to the boiler room they go into this equipment from that just has tons of bad everywhere\nWe go into the bridge to ... different holidays at the hospital we go into the infusion center\nThe quiet room yeah we we kind of take over the quiet room with the\nIt's a room that a rose medical center\nFor their employees so it's this room where they can go and just find some quiet to just being you\nKnow usually the basement I often associate that with where bodies dead bodies are that's not the case you know okay we love to see any real that this sounds like an insurers worst nightmare how did how did you possibly\nThe clearance and is the best question ever I have no idea where you are you a business with because I it just it everyone was let this happen I think we ... at that people come in and signed waivers uh-huh right off the bat but otherwise\nWe just have set it up so that there's hopefully nobody gets hurt first you know her\nWhat do you want people to get out of this [noise] so I have a limited perspective my perspective from the nursing I brought into other directors Leah ... tank and the three of us have we really want people to walk away with this idea\nThat life\nIs now we need you need to wake up and maybe like that any moment something can happen and it shifts and that life doesn't need an invitation death doesn't need an invitation you just have to walk through that door and start living it\nSo I guess to feel how precarious life is\nYeah OK mhm and that um our grief agrees actually is something that I'm can propel us forward\nDoes the nurse who held your hand in a critical moment does she know the impact she had on you\nI don't know I I wrote a comic hard for her but I don't know and I thought many times about reaching out to her\nBecause of this and um\nThat's a really good idea I probably should okay how do you think this has changed your view of nursing\nIt's made me much more appreciative of the work we do I I find this job at the calling us something sacred and I'm One of the most incredible professions that are out there to sit and be with people and some of the worst nightmares and then the ... in the midst of their suffering and be able to sit with them and not care for them [noise]\nBut you can still have a bad day absolutely how have so many bad and you can still\nEven be in a bad mood right I mean what would happen if you couldn't come to work sometimes in a bad mood\nAnd that's the thing is like it's bringing that bad mood and ... into your nursing\nThanks for being with us\nI think you Denver choreographer terror renders her new show first do no harm runs through October twenty eight

to withdraw from the Knight\nIn eighty seven agreement accusing Moscow of violating it for years Matthew button or reports Russia is threatening to retaliate\nSpeaking to journalists in Moscow today the Russian foreign ministry senior arms control official said that us withdrawal from the treaty would be a very dangerous step\nIn a lengthy Facebook post the head of the Russian Senate's foreign affairs committee with more blunt writing that all of mankind now faces chaos in the field of nuclear weapon Trump's announcement comes his national security adviser John Bolton makes his way to Moscow to discuss the fate of the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate nuclear forces treaty\nThe two sides have been accusing each other or violating this treaty and twenty fourteen Trump has said that he wants to renegotiate nuclear arms control and bring China which is not currently a signatory into the fault\nFor NPR News I'm Matthew Bodner in Moscow\nIraqi leaders have signed onto a lucrative arrangements with General Electric and the German company Siemens to develop the rocks power infrastructure NPR Shannon van Sandra reports the tentative agreement comes after intense international maneuvering\nSiemens had been the front runner for a report eight Fifteen billion dollar deal with Iraq to supply the country with power generation equipment but after pressure from the Trump Administration Iraq's government may get some of the work to us based GE\nAccording to Bloomberg News and the Financial Times U.S officials warned Iraq's prime minister not to move forward with Siemens and if he did so us rock relations would be at risk\nAlongside the GED deal the U.S has also reportedly signed a broader agreement to help Iraq no doubt it's energy sector and make the country energy independent chanted and sent NPR News Washington\nElections in Afghanistan are in their second day after of violence as well as technical and logistical difficulties kept some Afghans from voting yesterday Jennifer glass has more from Kabul\nMore than three million Afghans had voted so far despite Taliban and Islamic state threats the election has been far from perfect but the government is doing all it can to ensure that people will respect the outcome you'd arrested dozens of people in connection with fraud or interference and he's trying to downplay the violence and casualties even more than two hundred election related attacks this weekend\nOf the one hand there are a lot of products on the market a credit products that has a PR below thirty six percent but as I said the typical payday loan customer or applicant\nHas a credit score a that's five Seventeen it's in the low five hundreds or they're not getting credit cards they're not getting installment loans they're not getting those a sub thirty six percent NPR loans and they're not going to get them a after this ballot initiative if it passes\nA now are these predatory loans I I think that um that's an interesting thing to talk about what does predatory mean usually in the payday loan market and there are a thirty four other states in the country that have payday loans or as as well as Colorado usually in the ...\nLooking at issues of predation or abuse with loans that are are due in full in just two weeks and they take more than one third of the customers next paycheck when they come do they have a few hours in the range of four hundred percent or higher ah they have pre payment penalties or other kinds of harmful practices\nThe lonesome Colorado because of the two thousand ten law have none of those things so it's not clear to me what what is meant by the term predatory loan in this case\nAnd this goes back as I said to previous legislation that's been passed in Colorado [noise] uh and so it it sounds like other access to credit would be difficult to come by\n... as you say if the interest rate has kept in Colorado at thirty six percent a payday lenders will be out of the market uh but what do you base that claim on\nWell the as I say they're thirty five states in the country that have payday loan stores a Colorado is unique and its law\nOr the Fifteen states plus D.C that have that do not have painted on stores how they effective MPR limits in the range of thirty six percent Idaho empirically there's not a state that has that kind of a PR limit and has a store is making a credit available\nNow that like a payday loan or a small installment loan to people with this kind of credit score now every state in the country including Colorado has pawn shops and rent own stores\nWhich often cost a lot more than pay the loans every state in this country has consumers with checking accounts who have see based overdraft programs to charge a typically thirty five dollars every time somebody overdraft they're checking account\nBut payday loan stores do not exist in states where there's an effective if you are Catholic thirty six percent\nOh All right so we can look to other states as a harbinger of perhaps of what might happen in Colorado if prop ... passes on the midterm valid\nI think it's important to follow the money and the biggest contributor to one eleven is a group called the sixteenth thirty fund which is based in North Carolina and fights for among other things tax fairness transparency in government an access to health care\nAnd local donors this is interesting I include the mile high United Way I Want to say that we reached out to multiple payday lenders and none would do an interview on prop one eleven but not surprisingly we can say they oppose this measure [noise]\nIs it possible that if pay the loans aren't available in Colorado that people might be a forced into more dangerous situations I mean I I don't know I don't want to paint too bleak picture but like loan sharks is that a possibility or a the idea of even physical harm is something like that\nYou know the the loan shark thing comes up often there's no evidence of it OK I'm\nEvery now and then you will hear somebody tell a story how they know somebody who hangs up by a check cashing shop and they'll make a few hundred dollars available in small loans to people and formally um but on a on a widespread basis it just doesn't happen and and that that's for a lot of reasons but I can tell you one big reason it doesn't happen as\nPeople who use pay the loans are generally just kind of mainstream ordinary people they want to use legal stores they don't want to go to alleyways and get cash they're looking for a place that has a sign a storefront customer service some sense of protection\nFrom state law they don't go to um a loan sharks by and large\nBut um you know what they do do is they look at the other options on the table and some of them will overdraft more some of them will go to a pawn shops more rent own shops ... some of them\nWant borrow as much but um I can tell you that in in Colorado with the current pay the loans they're small installment loans everybody has a minimum repayment term of six months a the a PR and the cost of the overall cost is about four times lower than any other payday loan state and so there are a lot of protections\nYeah the question ... when we voter consumers asserting that I'm going to have to wrap it up but I think that the fundamental question facing voters is whether Colorado law has gone far enough or if they think it needs to go further I'm grateful for your time [noise] thank you Nick\n... director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable trusts in Washington DC and to reiterate neither he nor few ticket position on prop one eleven in Colorado the measure would cap interest rates on payday loans it's thirty six percent\nAnd they'll note again that payday lenders we contacted

demonstrate our commitment by raising our level of giving to become leadership partners this is a big move for us but we feel really good about it learn about giving it CPR dot org\nMrs Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan Warner and our next story exposes a little known aspect of slavery will say that some listeners may find disturbing\nDenver poet dominate Christina gives voice to end in slave to black woman who in the Eighteen hundreds endured medical experiments\nProcedures performed by a white doctor considered to be the father of modern gynecology\nChristine as new poetry collection is an arc that speaks a history in poems and welcome to Colorado matters thank you for having me you right in the voices of both an arc of the enslaved woman and Dr Jay Marion Sims the white doctor who experimented on her [noise]\nUh let's start with a poem written from Sims perspective Dr Sims makes something new that just set it up for us what is the new thing\nThis was really when he was at the precursor of inventing what would become the modern day speculation which is used today for pap smears and you know Danica logical exams\nAnd this grew out of his work some would say torture slaves correct okay so let me have you read this\nDoctor sends make something new what should happen most always is invention there is no wider mystery in the universe than that of woman\nWhat salt and bone she got she is a composition of after thought a borrowed read if you know your Bible she is so easily just assembled\nI take the ruins stock of ease the wilted pedals the spent flash and bring it wire steel restoration\nEverything we delight in came first by the blood of a woman\nAnd then and then iron and what men do after\nIt is well documented that Sims experimented on female slaves as part of his gun logical research correct [noise] what did these women endured during and after the experiments that poem really gives you the sense that there's a dehumanizing going on here\nRight and of course you know the the institution of slavery was already participating in that dehumanization and the modification of bodies so for me it's it's about doctors and sort of\nGlacial this inclination toward his subjects they were just subjects they were not human being they were not afforded the rights or the proper considerations that you would you know offer to a human being or someone that you respected or valued or emphasized with\nAnd fundamentally what he was trying to do because it was sort of a stigma attached to treating women I'm particularly guy like logically so he was trying to figure out a way to repair damages that were done during labor and delivery traumas specifically the ethical ... you know\nSteal it tears um and so he cornered these enslaved women in this makeshift hospital behind his house\nIn Alabama and experimented on them with the intent of perfecting that procedure and offering it to white women and he did so without anesthesia anesthesia without anesthesia\nRight there was a belief I've read that a black people could not feel pain that was part of correct what was in his I'd go to the point\nThat is right that was the prevailing sort of ideology at the time that black people did not record pain in the body the same way that others did and so it was fundamentally a way to justify brutality\nAnd so for these slaves for the people he was experimenting on this would have been incredibly painful course on for a long time of course yes ... would ever have been beneficial\nTo them yeah [noise] ah it's my understanding that he did repair some of these terrorists to the women um I think for me it's about\nProcedure um they were tortured and there was a ton of blood letting before repair it was done right and so there was still no real regard for their humanity or their person HUD yes he fixed certain injuries but he created others I\nHave been hunted since reading your collection I mean just just so haunted by this history I Wonder how it affected you when you first learned about an hour 'cause story and let's be clear that Antarctica is a a was a real life person\nAbsolutely um I found her by accident I'm In etymology so I went looking for the etymology of the word anarchy and I found this name with an ass tricks Antarctica\nAnd needed to try to track her down and it was clear that she was only the only language that was being ... for her\nWas as a means to talk about the doctor Jay Marion Sims and I was appalled by that then that would be that sets right in his story that's right but not the other way around that's right and so for me it was about trying to leave enough room for her\nTo be able to speak and tell her story and and move is much myself and my own projections out of the way which is really hard to do um but I think are really necessary thing to do if you're going to attempt to personify ... you\nAre listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're speaking with the Denver poet dominate Christina\nAnd she has a new collection of poetry called a ... speaks a history in poems and it should sheds light on some pretty terrible history a that on top of inflaming people in the United states slaves were also subjected to medical experiments and\nAh I I think what's what's so painful so complicated here is that much of the science the medical practice today is based on this that's right\nThat's right isn't that complicated you speak to speak to that\nFor me as a woman you know and it does it creates a tremendous complication for me I I recognize that there is always a balancing act that is required when we talk about what we are the beneficiaries of in our present day realities\nWe have to at some point interrogate how we got here and often times there was torture or pain or wounding or bruising in the back of it\nAnd so it does create a complication\nFundamentally for me though and our culture is not singular there's still a very important an urgent conversation around women today who do not have authorship over their bodies particularly during labor and delivery\nYou're still being prescribed and dictated to in the hospital room\nIt was very important to me that in this conversation we hear you use a ... voice similar collection and it's frankly the voice that I had like towards the end of the conversation sure we're left with her words would you read a poem called no magic no how yes\nNo magic know how that's when I take down my own dumb heart right there\nWere massive ... to say a mule what a few more miles left to a slave us stop by Stillwater on his way to someplace right there right there when massive Dr look right passed away I hurt to say she a tough old gal can take a mighty ...\nRight there right\nThere I scoop out the little bit of a woman left and then how goes to bully looted the creek bed not enough of a left even for remembering that's best no baby busted ... blood and mass the
