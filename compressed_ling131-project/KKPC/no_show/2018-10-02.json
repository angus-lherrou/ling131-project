{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "[noise] more to Syria Garth thanks for joining us today and kids and she is humanitarian emergency affairs director with World Vision speaking with us from Jakarta, Indonesia\nWe turn now to one of the most extraordinary developments in human history\nChina's government has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over near forty years\nThere's never been anything like it and China's new wealth and power are changing the world this week we're starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dotson joins us now to give us a preview hey well I also\nSo I understand the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China from the outside\n[noise] right well for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one economic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and China's not rising anymore it's risen right what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and\nIf you want to see that engagement you have to be looking outside of China and how did you decide\nWhere to go to a slots tennis match that influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe Southeast Asia\nAnd what we're looking to do is not just to sort of a cheetah a geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies\nStruggling societies places that are very far afield generally far out of their orbit and places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd telling us too much about the stories written here in the next coming days give us and if you found\nWell it'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz stout uh he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China in Australia have been really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners\nBut the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing this really remarkable here is that China is no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into public fears of other countries exercising censorship in foreign country exactly\nWhere else did you guys go well and in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure project that links to of Kenya's largest cities now this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed\nBut it's now leading to greater local resentment added this Chinese operation using Chinese labor\nAnd there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating get traps that could cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they are making masses investments are in these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story that look some of the problems that can double even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China's stifling free speech fear over investment in certain high tech sectors and also there's growing concern about China's investing huge amounts imports around the continent here's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe\nThey've invested all along the face of Europe it's like almost an anaconda strategy like he's surrounded and squeeze it and that way you you have some control and not very\nWhat an ominous analogy in anaconda had exactly the anaconda strategy and how China chooses to use that leverage Howitt deploys that leverage really could say everything to us about what\nIt in bold and China means for the rest of the world All right we'll be hearing these pieces across the network over the next two weeks That's NPR cheat international editor will Dobson thinks well thank you [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd you're

Colorado the Supreme Court has said that this is okay across the country there are big companies like buffalo wild wings and Hooters that want to have\nSports gambling and I think we can effectively the way it's worked in other states as a tack on at ten percent or Fifteen Percent tax\nOn the revenues of sports gambling 'em and dedicated to infrastructure improvements in I'm advocating for that could you do that with the legislatures help simply say that money will go here the absolute over and there is that there'll be legal challenges like there always are about whether it's a tax or a fee but that is an example the dedicated source of revenue\nAnd whether there would have to be a vote under the desk their bill of rights okay and to the idea of attainable housing what role can a governor play into that\nCouple of different roles um I think state government can be a valuable catalyst\nUh for creating more housing give us a supply and demand problem is somebody who has a background in economics it's a simple supply and demand problem on but we haven't done a good job of fixing it first of all I think we need a meaningful construction defects reform that we have not had and that includes a right to cure\nFor a builder over Ninety or a hundred and twenty day period if what they they don't have that if you had your dogs writer because living in well and and if you're building Ryan at three hundred unit condo development chances are you're going to find a wire that's misplaced in the bathroom the developers should be able to cure that over and now you're a hundred and twenty day period without the threat of litigation and that has stifled\nOr the development if you look at what's happening in Denver for instance uh last year we had about half the residential condo permits pulled and we had ten years ago even though the population has gone up\nBy more than a million people that's number one number two is I think the governor can work with ... on the tax credit process to Colorado is a ... yeah this is very\nColorado housing and finance on the tax credit program which is somewhat antiquated which is very very badly backlog so that if developers willing to put a portion of\nHis or her development towards affordable housing they can have as fast and effective\nIn approval process as possible very briefly what evidence do you have the construction defects reform will actually on a leash the condo market the evidence that I have is that if we meaningfully fixed it I think that we would have ... we would have more supply on market 'cause that's not all of it and that's what you think\nThat's I think that that's that is anecdotal evidence of a problem not being fixed I think that a lot of condo developers are not developing because of the threat in fear of lawsuits\nAnd a lot of the legislation is unfortunately been watered down by different interests homebuilders versus condo builders and I think it's absolutely the case that we would have more condos being built if we remove the threat of litigation on the subject of\nGrowth Denver's a finalist for Amazon's second headquarters which would bring an estimated fifty thousand workers to the area do you want Amazon here yes or no\nI'd like to have them here you would yes okay uh what concerns would you have about they're about they're coming up the concerns or do we have the infrastructure capabilities and workforce housing that would make us competitive and I think that there's deep and large questions around whether whether I could answer yes\nTo that question but in a perfect world what I liked him here absolutely ah they're high paying jobs they stimulate uh our economic growth air a catalyst to economic growth and I'm not for us giving Amazon handouts but I'm for them getting the exact same tax credits at businesses\nThat are of a smaller a medium size nature would receive\nMy guess is the Republican candidate for Colorado Governor Walker Stapleton\nWill take a break but before we do something to clarify he said under President Trump's tax cuts that someone who are in sixty thousand dollars would see their tax bill shrink from Seventeen hundred dollars to just one hundred we found an example where that is true for a married couple with two children\nThe tax liability for anyone else with that income would depend on a whole range of factors [noise]\nAll right after a break what would happen to medicate patients if Stapleton is elected he says Democrats are using a scare tactic when it comes to this issue here

candidate for governor he's running against Democrat Jared polish who joined us last week\nLet's talk about health care and another issue that came up on our road trip walkers Stapleton this from Gail nap whose family farms cantaloupe in rocky Ford she was at the family farm stand when we met her\nMy husband and I paid thirty three hundred dollars a month\nYou've just laid out a plan for health care what in it would be the most help to Gail nap\nThis is one of the reasons why I was an early supporter of the president's tax plan because it repealed the individual mandate for\nHealth insurance last year in Colorado has through and firemen requirement of of an individual to have health insurance and last year in Colorado more than a hundred and thirty thousand Coloradans were forced to pay a tax because they couldn't afford health insurance out of that population of Coloradans eighty percent of the household income uh fifty thousand dollars or less\nPhantom tax nothing in return I think the best way that we can fix the system we have a moral obligation I Believe Ryan to make sure that medicate um is extended to all the people that it's been extended to because half of the Medicaid population or kids\nI and as a father of a ten year old seven year old and four year old a we have to make sure that we're providing coverage for the most vulnerable among us which are our children\nBut the only way we do it is working with companies like optimum who can now do Ninety percent of the services an emergency room can do a ten percent of the cost of innovation\nWhich has innovated or how we deal with with seniors that are on Medicare uh what we don't do is make false promises of a government run system like congressman polish has done which would bankrupt Colorado's economy and sent thousands upon thousands of jobs\nFleeing our state is why two years ago I was co chair as you might know of the bipartisan effort to defeat a government run health care plan with Bill Ritter the former Democratic governor\nCase duct tape Democrat Jared polish has called for a Medicare for all system but he thinks it would be a boon to business cutting from his plan by taking the burden of administering employee health care off the shoulders of employers businesses can focus more on there\nCore products and services are right back to walk Stapleton you talk about the\nEnd of the individual mandate there are some who would say that in the end is going to make health care more expensive because\nYoung healthy people have no incentive to be in the pool and to lower costs for everyone\nWhat do you say that I disagree I think the way that we add more incentives is to have more insurance companies competing for business we need to get back to I've got to a number of millennials who who work on our campaign and they told me that their frustration with the healthcare system is they can't find a health care plan\nThat matches up with their health needs and they want to get back to a catastrophic\nHealth insurance plan with a higher deductible um for people that are generally healthy and the only way that that happens is more\nCompanies competing in the marketplace and companies have left the exchange or health exchange\nUm in droves since we started the exchange because there's been no incentive\nFor companies to stay in the exchange except bad press with premiums going up and so people to join Colorado's health exchange today I get very limited choices of carriers and the way that you actually increase choices for consumers health care consumers is having more companies competing in the marketplace in the way you do that\nI is transparency and billing or whether it be emergency room building which my running mate Lang sigh us um was\nThe sponsor of in the last legislative session it should be extended all across our healthcare system [noise]\nThen to medicate you said you think those currently on Medicaid ought to be able to stay on Medicaid is that what I'm hearing because ... and that's a scare tactic that's been used\nAgainst me a repeatedly we have a moral obligation if you talk to\nAgenda house and then the c._e._o. of children's hospital she will say that that that she believes in and I agree with her wholeheartedly we have a moral obligation to make Medicaid work because of the fact that half the Medicaid population or kids you have said though in your latest health care plan\nThat while it's necessary to defend the social safety net we must reign in costs absolutely let's focus on rain in costs how do you do that than without shrinking the Medicaid roles and let me just get this clear from you is there a person on Medicaid today you don't think should be\nAh I I don't know I don't know specifically the population I would I Would take a an approach towards rainy and costs by I think we need to do or review of ... and how hip hop has dealt with Medicaid expansion so that's a letter to some of it you can't throw it off and just let it said so ...\nUm I've got all sorts of different stuff I went to see Miles Davis as a kid and dizzy Gillespie with my jazz band I played a a Stradivarius trumpet

century people in southern Colorado voted mostly for Democrats that changed in the last presidential election why well many voters said they felt forgotten by leaders who were too focused on urban and

because that was the maternity pet people were staying in these tents for up to Fifteen months during the strike and women went into this bigger tip give\nBirth [noise]\nMore than a thousand miners and their families lived on this site back then coal mining was huge down here in Los Angeles and where for no counties but conditions were terrible and pay was low so miners walked off the job\nThe company called in the national guard\nAnd then one day in December violence erupted [noise]\nOn the day of the massacre it was chaotic there are people with rifles on both sides\nBut the national guard\nHad a machine gun they opened fire on the strikers guardsmen burn the camp to the ground [noise]\nNo one knew those children and women were in that pit and so they suffocated there [noise]\n\nAbout two dozen people died in what came to be known as the Ludlow Massacre the event marked a turning point in the fight for better wages and working conditions and there's another reason but most important the local politics changed the miners\nTurned I Would say against the Republican Party and became more democratic\nAnd for a long long time that's the way it was my name's slowed down big time after World War two but steel mills and manufacturing in southern Colorado continued to ensure that labor was a big player here and where you have labor unions give Democrats the Democratic party ran the show for decades\nThe one that party's primary you pretty much won the election but here's the thing the Democrats hold on the area is not what it used to be\nWhen ever people are just contented live their lives\nAnd people are just kick candid in southern Colorado because of the lack of opportunity and jobs and then people tend to look at you know their political party\nAnd that's exactly what happened in twenty sixteen many counties in southern Colorado voted for now President Trump in some cases it was the first time they'd flipped read in decades [noise]\nAlmost immediately people cited southern Colorado as a western example of the rust belt effect after years of steady support for Democrats blue collar workers found something attractive in Trump's populism\nSo this week on purplish we're going to look at the cost of political neglect what happens when a plea deals forgotten and what my\nThat means for the midterms and beyond [noise]\n[noise] okay so this episode is going to be something of a tour of southern Colorado and we're going to start by leaving the ... massacre site and driving about an hour north on twenty five\nThat's where you'll find Pueblo, Colorado which is generally thought of as the capital of this region Alison cherry CPR is justice reporter recently visited the city as a part of CPR election road trip series Alison set the scene for us what kind of police is Pueblo\nSo the first thing you notice when you go down I twenty five is that when you enter ... huge smokestacks and our our road and some sort of dusty old historic buildings\nThese are all in terms of what the town used to be it has a tradition of being a steel town and and that lore carries an every conversation even now there are fewer steel jobs but everybody I talked to brought up the steel mill whether asked him about it or not\nAnd Portland was definitely contested real estate in twenty sixteen how did the presidential candidates appeal to voters in this part of Colorado\nWell they they both went there which is one thing they both made stops\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton gave a standard stump speech\n[noise] adopting the president\nFor everyone and I said well do you think they're like you and rub blow and Trump was Trump's I should I think so [noise] they should what do you have a lot of Hispanics slashed Latinos and\nWeb ... and I said I think that's why they're doing you're likely that you know why they're going to watch\nBut it was much more tailored to the audience and we're going to put the miners back to work that\nTalked about bringing manufacturing jobs back keeping money in America he talked about keeping jobs in America I talked about crime it was clear that Trump's message was resonating with people and plus [noise]\nHow things break down on election Clinton won Colorado by five points but in ... county it was too close to call on election night\nDemocratic Party leaders are still reeling from the news that many in the party crossed over\nTrump narrowly won the county by less than one percentage point and it's a huge departure from twenty twelve when President Obama won the county by fourteen points this means clearly there are a lot of people who both voted for President Obama and now President Trump\nWhen he went to ... did you meet anybody who had been a reliable democratic voter and then voted for Trump uh twenty six team\nYeah go ahead [noise] sure [noise]\nShe shocked that I picked her as I said a shot [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not thinking you never do I'm Sorry go ahead\nThat was pretty extraordinary Brian I'm I mean we know the president talks about the press in very [laughter] I'm disparaging terms but for him to do that to a a female member of the White House press corps just even hearing it yet again\nIt's so it's it's shocking in how I'm I'm at a loss for words\nYeah and I think he also cut off another woman reporter and occurred way when she'd yesterday in law and let us Kevin lied under oath I think that was the question ... of CNN so maybe for the absurd contrast of the day Trump also said that he and Kim Jong on have fallen in love\nHe actually said that that they started off rough but Kim has now written a beautiful letter to him in and they're in love\nOne of the most brutal dictators in the world often seen as running the worst government on the planet but he and Trump are in love according to the Trump and women journalists who ask tough questions or have an even asked a tough question yet as an Cecilia Vegas case\nUh the enemy of the people and they don't think\n... I you you brought up I'm Caitlin calling from CNN um is the the other female journalist who was called on by President Trump and take a listen to death it's very quick\nIt's like I say go ahead please can you know what you're really ... you've had enough\nNow she said that that was very quick is only about five seconds but Caitlin Caitlin Collins you hear that tail end of her trying to ask the president a question and he keeps talking over her\nAs she tries to ask a ask her questions I mean Janelle made a journalist job is hard but when the president is this respects um women journalists like this and I put it like that because I\nMean he does that two men but in this moment that we're in it just it ... to me speaking personally it hits me it's a rather galling\nYeah [noise] I mean this president certainly has a habit of disrespecting both the press and women\nAre in doing so openly and I think we've become a little bit to newer to that if the ... it's not quite enough of a problem or in this in a society but I think that you know [noise] you have your an example of him not being able to contain his ... nature and a\nPress conference you don't get to choose which questions you get asked\nAnd I think just who you're baking made that point herself afterwards you don't get to select a you know what ... you know get brought into the conversation\nYou get to answer the question and I think frankly for President Trump or we're not willing to\nBe a part of that he very frankly he should never run for public service and I know that that sounds maybe a little bit of a to Z given the fact that he's the president and there's all these kind of\nA you know benefits of the office right he loves but I mean frankly he used a public servant he answers to us in the press is an extension of the public needs to quickly either under understand that were being made to understand that by the people in other people or once we have ...\nAnd what I'm going to give you the last word on this but I also in your in your response I I I Want you to respond to this or are we flash me am I making too much of of how he treated Cecilia Vegas and Caitlin calling\nWell I understand your reaction and I shared a little bit but I Do have to say that are in the president's defense he is an equal opportunity jackass\nAnd um has gone after men in the most demeaning possible ways that he can think of at the moment teen after all he\nIs most famous a controversial comment at the beginning of twenty sixteen was about John McCain and and challenging his heroism um he made fun of Rubio's wedding he said the case it was a slob\nUm he accused Ted Cruz's father of having been in on the John F. Kennedy assassination it goes on and on so um yeah he's he's grotesque to women 'em up but he is Jeanette and as well so that's my defense of the president\nYou know I wanted a in a little bit of time we've got time to play at a here is what Senator Flake and senator Coons had to say about the Kavanaugh nomination\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee [noise] nominations over Oh yes I Would think so\nAnd ... yes or no or answer Brian you agree yes or ... agreed the nominations over if he's found that is why\nI think they could get to a point where they're quibbling over how ...\nIt should be Mona\nIt's going to depend on how a senators Collins and Murkowski and flake interpret alliances\nAnd with that we have to go thank you all for being on America on the line tomorrow it's all about the Mueller investigation we'll see you tomorrow [noise]\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support is provided by the anti Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr Mary White\n\nListening to end up news from Colorado Public radio on Ninety point one F.

Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion the sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it\n[noise] see your your team contacts Flynn just say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions after Trump takes office\nAnd Flynn of course denied it and denied it and denied it and then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nI'm so when we write stories like this you know basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public and there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague guarantee young who had previously scheduled interview with Flynn\nIn his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raised this question with him on last time to tell him look post is close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats it several times no no no basically did not happen so caring comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this and we actually hit pause and the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the\nSort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to theirs and we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Kamron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I I ever use the word number nine I laid I said we have nine different sources telling us this is true and and described outsourcing to those editors\nAnd came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to to nail this town I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with the story we need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing\nSo that's that's in motion another interaction with when that was amazing so we call the White House we say we have the denial we're going to use that on the record we're going forward with the story anyway we're confident our sources and then the White House ...\nComes back to us cause me it through a spokesman calls me and says for the first time\nI'm Mr Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed and that call he can't be sure that the subject didn't come up\nAnd that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten I don't know sixteen hours earlier that we knew that we were we knew we were right and that's when we published\n[noise] so when Flynn was forced out of the Trump Administration\nLike ... how did that feel if I Do feel like proud that you'd broken veteran consequential story [noise]\nUm do you feel like good like truth has been out there and that's what I really like to know what it feels like that is that wasn't really sure if they're really big thing very very early in the Trump Administration\nAll the all of the above Terry so sure absolutely proud of our of our work proud that we would have been able to accomplish something of such consequences proud that we were um\nYou know especially in this climate where the process is under constant siege an attack that we were able to do work that still mad that that mattered in your head immediate impact all of that [noise] I mean not that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas and at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster I'm In his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean it was\nAs a reporter\nThere is there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\nDid you face consequences did you get ... a lot as a result of having an mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... ... absolutely so troll to la attacked\nA lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the this administration at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting carts ... actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and fake me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\n[noise] let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter\nBrad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and assume version of American democracy we'll be right back this is fresh air\n\n\n\nThe [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy\nAnd it kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by meller and other reporters that the Washington Post\nNow you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very controversial in the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a fall to is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are just weighing that is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision\nAnd we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true in other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans and tell almost a month later this sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless as I you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this in the book and Brennan feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has this objective they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and try to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by McConnell is saying well if you basically tells them\nIf you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will and I will call the administration out on that I Will accuse the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering election\n[noise] you you right who had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would\nUh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia is trying to tilt the outcome of this election\nThe Obama team felt sort of\nHandcuffed I'm now ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refuse to go along they're sort of stuck\nThey can't see a way past that it takes them months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only ... only gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose\n[noise] you know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference in this was in late September\nI'm with a letter to state election officials from all four leaders of Congress warning of unnamed ... Malik factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd it urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell given I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mention of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look packets of started to look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um\nSo so meanwhile John Brennan was trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell is saying oh yeah if you say that again they say you're interfering in the election so brand and recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is down to the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it and then tried to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like trees and um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um that tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeem to overwhelm everything else including the ... concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election an American election for president of the United states\nWhat is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet we see numerous cases through this period in which um when senior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them their impulse is to you\nIn fact the party interests to try to protect the prospect of a Trump victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's it's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller he covers national security and intelligence from the Washington Post now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and they take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air Mm\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from ...\nAnd from progressive insurance offering or weights or by home insurance with their homes quote exploratory custom clothes in the rain that are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progression now bats progressive and from the I.

I'm not going to trust and not and I'm an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are you rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident\nAnd do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really ... in a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nThat's absolutely right these sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nSome women talked about being a tomboy others mentioned walking in male dominated fields and feeling harassed by co workers but men\nMen say things like ... I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's per se while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n[noise]\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial thing the familiar explanation is massage any or homophobia nuts about Boston talked to she began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age\nAre you a real man or they say man up\nBoston built on the inside and conducted a series of research experiment why men behave the way they do hook inclusion\nMy collaborators and I argue that the male gender role itself it's kind of conceptualize it as a more precarious status so manhood is something that hard to earn an easy to lose relative to womanhood\n\nManhood is something that's hard to earn and easy to do the men fewer pink shirts and pushes because they are defending something fragile in terms of why this would be the case\nOr why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries or why do women take that femininity for granted in ways that men do not take them asking handy for granted\nThat's a really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise]\nHow men their social status is more hierarchy Akeley organized than women is\nSo men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men will think what women will think well they themselves might think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it is to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nYou could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert lawn when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school his wife's dad had a suggestion\nMy father in law who's a respiratory therapist\nSaid hey you know you should really look into nursing von didn't immediately take his father in law's advice like a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a a woman's job\nBut one did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard and one day something happened that uptown has stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there was blood all over the place and the nurses in us and the sheriffs were holding him down and it's a dating and and restraining him I was like man this is this is pretty cool [laughter] the action the nurses were saying was pretty exciting for me [noise]\nYou know you think of nursing do you think of someone sitting at a [noise]\nA bedside and being like let me hold your hand in and you see what it is realistically day today\nAnd for me it was\nWhen it comes to fighting stereotypes we often imagined that the right approach is to explain why stereotypes are wrong [noise]\nBut Robin Williams lives and Jennifer Boston's experiments suggest a different solution and perhaps a more effective one [noise]\nStereotypes are powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves how powerful the shape how we see the

the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all fulltime part-time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means highly nagging morning and just to note here Amazon is one of interest and natural supporters so lean on what other details can you share\nRight so they should press release in here if he takes away from that take away from that you mentioned at the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nWhich is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number a few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in worse and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand is on it well\nI mean I I noticed that you just talked about Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers is is this change will result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about though the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our fulltime workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you count in all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base does a CEO Jeff Bass us came to speak in Washington I'm a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of just days those not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become and a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking truck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of\nUm you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere should be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers in retail on and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nI mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nThere is a really

EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin California is on track to find out just how much control one\nState can have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner treat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California\nThis year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim Wu is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor and they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I think that that they are of decided they really want to have a a a an environment where are you know it's it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that the the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nIn about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally and when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's the but California's argument will be\nWhat is the precedent this kid sets and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically a film and gaps\nThe federal government has abandoned the neutrality um for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is a really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that this is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all the one that they've also they they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the slow the ... the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised so many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a

Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swept in certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers there\nHigher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper places to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor again from the deal Yuki Noguchi

at the time governor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punish the poor\nTurns out though the story is more complicated many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform now say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports or\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase a blue dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state\nAfter all beaming fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system the size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody\nAnd the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the races system of mass incarceration the just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty not Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded do dean argues including compass anyone for any offense that he says will to power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder a speech and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as your prior history or under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to see preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial to tensions that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single\nDay the new Dell\nReform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups\nBrief similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse\nOr this very factors that the risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fen already knows that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that didn't know how to make it should also a write off being identified as a threat to public safety and it shouldn't be or people needlessly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who said there'll be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in

really been racking up the miles traveling across Colorado a head of election day which you know now is a little more than a month away\nWe've been to rocky Ford and the north west coal country in northeastern Colorado almost to Nebraska and there are stops in Pueblo in Greeley in Steamboat Springs and elsewhere and all of that traveling has brought back voices and pictures\nFrom parts of the states or that you you know you might not know as well as you would like to you can check out this road trip to November and CPR dot org find a lot of other Colorado news there as usual CPR dot org is that address\nThis is CPR news on MORNING edition [noise]\n\nLet's talk about health care we heard from Gail nap whose family\nFarms cantaloupe and rocky Ford she was running the family farm stand when we caught up with her\nMy husband and I paid thirty three hundred dollars\nYou've just announced a plan for health care in your first one hundred days in office should you be elected what in that would do the most to help Gail nap\nGills right we need immediate action to lower the cost expand access improve quality\nA there's a number of areas and that that will save Gayle in her family money on health care one is establishing reinsurance at the state level to create larger risk pools and other lane explain reinsurance ... happy do with that basically would allow or is that would allow a greater risk pool for some of the most severe and high risk\nPatients that otherwise could drive up costs within any insurance program so that's the way of spreading risk and therefore creating greater savings for rate payers because those risks won't whatever plan she's on won't drive up the costs of that particular plant\nA prescription drugs or another one um about a quarter of healthcare costs are prescription drugs and we want to use\nWhether it's the Medicaid dollars be able to have an interstate consortium we have a number of ways to get there but we want to have better negotiation for prescription drug prices and bring those more in line with what others are paying a in other countries\n[noise] the roadmap this this first one hundred days or in terms of health care doesn't mention what has been a hallmark campaign proposal for you which is a version of universal health care that you have dubbed Medicare for all does that remain on your agenda and if so what might happen in that direction in the first one hundred\nDays I've always supported a Medicare for all a nationally up have you been sponsored the bill I think that we have a great program Medicare where what our country be without Medicare for seniors that already covers the highest risk highest cost population\nI think that we should have and we can reduce costs by having a basic level of care for everybody it's really in stark contrast to a Walker staple ... plan to throw hundreds of thousands of Coloradans off their health care by ending the Medicaid expansion\nThat would also raise costs for the rest of us because when you have a larger uninsured population guess who's paying for them it's you and I who are paying for our insurance so first of all we want to\nLeave that more innovation and perhaps more choice more flexible plans a might pay to a different reality but did they say well\nWe're I'm certainly for that too but you know specifically I was referring to his a commitment to end the Medicaid expansion uh obviously we are I certainly support innovative a bundle payments and other mechanisms to bring down rates and use their Medicaid dollars more wisely\nHas he said point blank were ending it in total\nYes he said he would end the Medicaid expansion and he's also said we would phase out the exchanges\nAll right let's pause here polish his Republican opponent has said quote it is not a question of if but when we have to get rid of the health care exchange Walker Stapleton told us during the primary he doesn't think it's working as it should he does not specifically called for its demise in his recent health care proposal\nAs for ending the Medicaid expansion Stapleton says that's a scare tactic but he does say well it's necessary to defend the social safety net we must reign in costs [noise]\nOkay let's roll tape again with Jared polish and his thoughts on healthcare back to the idea of what Medicare for all would look like in your first one hundred days it doesn't appear on that road map\nOr North Star is I support any reform from the right the left or the center on healthcare\nThat saves people money expands coverage and maintains or improve the quality of care so we we put pen to paper and we put a number of things that we can achieve towards all three of those goals within the first hundred days I'm obviously I won't give up until we've achieved\nA way to say people money and provide a universal basic level of care but I don't think it's realistic to get that done in a hundred days\nRight now there are any number of issues at play between Colorado and the federal government's immigration marijuana environmental regulation I even down to the nitty gritty of whether a Grand Junction will become the headquarters of the bureau of land management\nLast year you voted for a resolution to begin impeachment proceedings against the president it only got fifty eight votes the leaders of your own party oppose the move\nAs governor of Colorado how would you build a relationship with the Trump Administration that you have hinted then maybe even stronger than that shouldn't be an office well\nNo secret that I didn't ah support that Kennedy\nFirst of all you know I'm willing to take on the party leadership on either side\nUm with regard to ah being able to work with people look I can work with anybody even this president on issues that improve the quality of life in Colorado at President Trump is sincere about investment in infrastructure\nI look forward to working with him to make a real plan that works for for Colorado but at the same time I think it's very important that Colorado doesn't have a Donald Trump yes man as governor\nThat is democratic candidate for governor of Colorado Jared polish were airing excerpts

retailer Amazon says it's increasing its minimum wage for ... staffers to Fifteen dollars an hour the company's senior vice president Dave Clark says the pay raise will affect all workers full and part time as well as seasonal employees\nWith a million dollars is a place that want to be [noise]\nSo we want to go now so we decided to last November first [noise]\nOr just in time for the holiday for all our voice\nAmazon is among NPR's financial supporters astronomers have discovered a dwarf planet in the furthest reaches of our solar system as NPR's Joe Palca explains the new object seems to confirm the existence of and as yet undiscovered giant planet\nAstronomers from the Carnegie Institution for science first spotted the mini climate nicknamed the goblins and twenty Fifteen it's only about two hundred miles across it took three years of observations to determine its orbit and a strange ordered it is it's highly elongated and somewhat tilted out of the plane and the rest of the planets and asteroids\nIt's also way way out there at its closest approach the goblet has still six billion miles from the sun and it takes forty thousand years to complete a single orbit\nMany astronomers think the gravitational tug of a giant undiscovered planet is the best explanation for the unusual orbit of the goblins and similar objects that have been found Joe Palca NPR News\nTo test out you know the details that will come out of those two interviews and I know they've been interviewed before but not by it so that won't be a very thorough interview they have these people merit and not provide them answers in the course and better than a question\nFor credit Christians worker former assistant director of Europe you know it's actually much\nThank you [noise]\nAll right there was some big news out of one of the world the biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all full time part time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nIt's a bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means highly nagging morning and just to note here Amazon is one of NPR's natural supporter solely know what other details\nCan you share right so they should press release in here if you takes away from that take away from that you mentioned that uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part-time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nWhich is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number of few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in worse and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand\nTimes on well I mean I I noticed that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers is is this change will result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about the the way that uh the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with a if you count in all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base those a CEO Jeff basis came to speak in Washington I'm a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become in a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking truck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of\nUm you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere should be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail on and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nI mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big a thing in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working again congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge\nIt's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the states have been moving toward this target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um this is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of\nPeople who might be looking for employment right during the holiday\nSeason All right great explainer NPR business reporter Alina Selyukh for us on this announcement that Amazon is raising minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour

control one state can have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that that they are or have decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this as an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state I'm In about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs this and they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally and when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the wire to ... that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's a what a California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid's sets and dozens of other states are considering that in ... last night\nAnd in fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically a feeling gaps\nThe federal government has abandoned the neutrality um for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states or feel differently Internet's that's our California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of France on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a question of the California go law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see are the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I I think almost all of them on ... they've all said they they like and that new show the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or AT and T. we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans one that child the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to this law the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets\nAnd set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the ... the largest union in the U.S and her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nWould make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages app which by the way have positive\nThat fat on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes the U.S a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build on won't be able to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor games from the deal ...

state to abolish cash bail at the time governor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor alike will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor\nTurns out those stories more complicated many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform now say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chaser booed dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or SP ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state\nAfter all dean and fellow public service lawyers of long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system the size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood I was disappointed\nAnd I felt betrayed\nThe new has to be ten doesn't actually change the race as system of mass incarceration just expands in\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nRoutine believes this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded ... argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will tilt the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder a speech and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address the problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stopped search decaying arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse\nOr there's various factors that the risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan or do you notice that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should also rights are being identified as a threat like they shouldn't people quickly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsmen in an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who say they will be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court\nAs soon as it takes effect next year Eric Westervelt NPR News San Francisco this is NPR News this is CPR\nNews and MORNING EDITION continues for another few minutes
