idea of attainable housing what role can a governor play into that\nA couple of different roles um I think state government can be a valuable catalyst\nFor creating more housing give us a a supply and demand problem with somebody who has a background in economics it's a simple supply and demand problem um but we haven't done a good job of fixing it first of all I think we need a meaningful

dogs right there because we're living in well and and if you're building Ryan at three hundred unit condo development chances are you're going to find a wire that's misplaced in the bathroom the developers should be able to cure that over and now you're a hundred and twenty day period without the threat of litigation\nAnd that has stifled or the development if you look at what's happening in Denver for instance uh last year we had about half the residential condo permits pulled and we had ten years ago even though the population has gone up\nBy more than a million people that's number one number two is I think the governor can work with ... on the tax credit process to Colorado has a ... yes this is very\nColorado housing and finance on the tax credit program which is somewhat antiquated which is very very badly backlog so that if developers willing to put a portion of\nHis or her development towards affordable housing they can have as fast ineffective and approval process as possible very briefly what evidence do you have\nThe construction defects reform will actually unleash the condo market the evidence that I have is that if we meaningfully fixed it I think that we would have had we would have more supply on market because that's not as it ended us what you think\nThat's I think that that's that is anecdotal evidence of a problem not being fixed I think that a lot of condo developers are not developing because of the threat in fear of lawsuits\nAnd a lot of the legislation has unfortunately been watered down by different interests homebuilders versus condo builders and I think it's absolutely the case that we would have more condos being built if we remove the threat of litigation on\nThis subject of growth Denver's a finalist for Amazon's second

matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar for a century people in southern Colorado voted mostly for Democrats that changed in the last presidential election why well many voters said they felt forgotten by leaders who were too focused on urban and suburban communities\nIt's the focus of the latest purplish podcast from CPR news about Colorado's political identity here is host San brash\nDrive south

Nineteen fourteen\nLift the largest ... in this area because that was the maternity pet people were staying in these tents for up to Fifteen months during the strike\nAnd women went into this bigger tip to give birth\nMore than a thousand miners and their families lived on this site back then coal mining was huge down here in Los Angeles and where for no counties but conditions were terrible and pay was low so miners walked off the job\nThe company called in the national guard\nAnd then one day in December violence erupted [noise]\nOn the day of the massacre it was chaotic there are people with rifles on both sides\nBut the national guard had a machine gun they opened fire on the strikers guardsmen burned the camp to the ground [noise]\nNo one knew those children and women were in that pit and so they suffocated there [noise]\n\n\nAbout two dozen people died in what came to be known as the ... massacre the event marked a turning point in the fight for better wages and working conditions and there's another reason why those important the local politics changed\nThe miners turned I Would say against the Republican Party and became more democratic\nAnd for a long long time that's the way it was minding slowed down big time after World War two but steel mills and manufacturing in southern Colorado continued to ensure that labor was a big player here and where you have labor unions you have Democrats the Democratic party ran the show for decades\nThe one that party's primary you pretty much won the election but here's the thing the Democrats hold on the area is not what it used to be\nWhen ever people are just contented live their lives and people are just contended in southern Colorado\nBecause of the lack of opportunity and jobs and then people tend to look at you know their political party\nAnd that's exactly what happened in twenty sixteen many counties in southern Colorado voted for now President Trump in some cases it was the first time they'd flip thread in decades [noise]\nAlmost immediately people cited southern Colorado as a western example of the rust belt effect\nAfter years of steady support for Democrats blue collar workers found something attractive in Trump's populism so this week on purplish we're going to look at the costs of political neglect what happens when a plea deals forgotten and what might that mean for the midterms and beyond [noise]\nOkay so this episode is going to be something of a tour of southern Colorado and we're going to start by leaving the ... massacre site and driving about an hour north on twenty five\nThat's where you'll find Pueblo, Colorado which is generally thought of as the capital of this region Alison Sherry CPR is justice reporter recently visited the city as a part of CPR is election road trip series Alison set the scene for us what kind of police is Pueblo\nThe first thing you notice when you go down I twenty five is that when you mentioned ... huge smokestacks and around red and some sort of dusty old historic buildings these are all ... of what the town used to be it has a tradition of being a steel town and and that lore carries in every conversation\nOh way and throw it aside every notion of fairness of justice of decency and due process nobody seen anything like it\nEarlier in the day people waiting in line outside the rally cheered at Kavanaugh's confirmation a few dozen protested the news and the designated area away from the venue for NPR News I'm no mean ... in Topeka\nShortly after yesterday's Senate vote Democrat Cory Booker flew to Iowa to headline a democratic fundraiser Booker who serves on the Senate Judiciary committee says the process for confirming Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court was a sham he also says it's no time to be

Eighteen eighty one\nA top Vatican official has released an open letter that accuses a vocal critic of Pope Francis of blasphemy and defamation NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports it's the first official response to a former Vatican diplomat who accused the pope of covering up sexual misconduct\nBy former cardinal and arch bishop Theodore ...\nThe Vatican has issued a scathing three page rip you from ...\nHead of the powerful bishops congregation to archbishop Jerome ... bomb shell claims in August ... had accused Francis and other church officials of having turned a blind eye for years to ... misconduct and called for the pope's resignation\nIn a detailed ... those claims will it accuses the former diplomat\nI think it's it's up for grabs I really do much polish and Mr Stapleton need to spend some time down here they better pay attention to us\nSo have pulled us in Stapleton been campaigning in southern Colorado\nYeah they had the ... and ... says attended are held forty events according to ... percent and staple tendons than down their quote unquote dozens of times that they counted has yours is covered a treasure\nBut also I should note that the the day I called about this the hour I called about this Stapleton was delivering a speech in ... and then moving on to the family salad\nSo according to the campaigns the candidates are there but so far it doesn't sound like their message that's connected with the voters in southern Colorado in a way where they feel like their lessons Chelsea\nOkay but let's look at this from campaigns perspective because I did some math\nAnd eighty percent of active voters in Colorado live along the northern front range so in places like Denver Fort Collins Colorado Springs the suburbs around all those places have why should people in these places be concerned that\nVoters in more rural parts of Colorado like southern Colorado don't feel listen to do\nFeel like their priorities are being represented [noise]\nTheir mortgages but other persons that the average you\nKnow if you've ever wanted to make the point I'm trying to make is that that in a democracy you know you want the majority of people to have a say and if the majority of people have them be urban voters\nThen I'm not sure we should be protecting the voices\nOf rural voters at the cost of bourbon and sort of [noise]\nThe first thing that comes to mind is like it's okay to one good things for other people's\nMy second argument would be a you know people moved to Denver and to Fort Collins a in Boulder\nAnd they go other places right like Colorado is a beautiful state and we don't live in a city just in cities live here because of its proximity to everything else the veil to crested Butte and southern Colorado like this really cool things down there\nSo I don't know how do you live in the same neighborhood as Walker staple ten or ...\nNo I'm not going to say where I live for the purpose of this broadcast but I don't think I live near you\nOkay so I think when someone who lives in Boulder lives in some Denver suburb cares about Pueblo or cares about Grand Junction\nUm or cares about northern Colorado it sends a message to the rest of the state that they care about them too and the other thing I Would say is I'm a justice reporter and I cover a lot of rural jails and I've been in a lot of ... and I will say that the opioid crisis in San Luis valley\nAnd the overcrowding you know if one part of the state it's economically suffering we all pay for that\nSo now if you know freshmen philosophy on here that's okay that's allowed for the show okay great so so earnest but uh let's think about utilitarian if I'm right and that this was the idea\nIn philosophy that a moral decision is one that does the greatest good for the greatest number of people right right so if your governor that means your decisions will be for the you know people along the front range where most people with there's another part of utilitarian is which is\nThese decisions are hurt or moral and good if they if they lost to the long run I Would argue that over the long term Colorado it'd be better off if if it's candidates for governor really did eventually everyone everyone\nThey knew Alison thanks for coming it was awesome Sam welcome\nTo this episode of purple Bush connects with a newsroom wide project from CPR called road trip\nTo November Allison in nature and many other reporters here have traveled the state to learn what people are concerned about ahead of the midterms\nLeading up to election day they're going to go to share what they heard today I'm joined by Allison as well as John de Leon Andrea Dukakis to talk about the governor's race in particular\nAnd a welcome to all of you nice to see when the student age do you enter you were in another part of southern Colorado driving highway fifty from the San Luis valley to Durango\nRough gig ... drive you're generally what did you hear about the governor's race\nWell I asked a lot of people I met about the upcoming elections and they didn't seem at all focused on the governor's race\nThis was a few weeks ago so things may have changed but no one brought up the race unless I asked them what they did bring up over and over again we're concerned about drought water and lack of water many of the people I talk to live off the land farmers and ranchers\nI went on a ride with Alan most that county commissioner dairy is Alan and I was also a rancher he wears a big cowboy hat and boots and he kept me to see land that he says he's usually super green\nBut not so much this year and like others he told me he's not happy that both candidates for governor or from the front range and thinks they don't understand the lives of people I Can't\nI've talked to divert oil candidate come out here and I'm like okay I'm all for you to treat her like two hundred and fifty girls are pulled off yesterday the Lakers backwards I don't know what that's all we have those rules groups like what you're\nI mean this is also a part of the state where there's a lot of poverty and it's been hard hit by the opioid crisis over Ninety percent of folks admitted into the Alamo Allen most of the county jail excuse me test positive for heroin so I guess people feel like there are a lot more pressing issues\nI definitely heard about water to um I was down in ... county which is east of where Andrea was on and I talked to in ... county commissioner who was also a cattle rancher\nHe was saying that they a lot of people on where he lives cut down on their cattle operations during the severe drought uh twenty twelve they got rid of cats\nAnd they've actually built them back up since then and now because of the severe drought particularly in the southern part of the state they're really struggling because they're just because of what Andrea said about the grasslands the other thing I Want to say is that everybody in rural areas talks about health care costs are real concern from among Democrats and Republicans\nThere was a woman I talked to was running a fruit stand in rocky Ford and she pays\nSome more than three thousand dollars a month for her and her husband for health care and she's a Republican and she elected Republicans to fix this and because the last two years have gone by and there's a Republican Congress and Republican president\nAnd there's been no fix she's very disappointed\nThese are issues that the candidates have weighed in on particularly health care policy or did the people you talked with connect those concerns to the candidates' positions ensure they hear\nThe candidates talking about these issues on the news and in campaign ads but they say they want the candidates to visit the area more often and see for themselves how things like the drought and heroin effect southern Colorado Jason ... county commissioner and to watch\nA lot of people I think would say look if you take the time to come that's half the battle right there\nAnd you know I mentioned this on purpose to but the candidates actually are visiting there according to both campaigns have been down there you know a few dozen times I think just the messages are resonating they don't have that populist feel that uh that that's making people feel like they're being listened to and are addressing that anxiety\nI can tell you there's a lot of Democrats are excited about her having German POWs from the lieutenant governor from the same region in Colorado or we were hoping for\nGovernor from Pablo or from rural areas\nThat was that Gilbert ... he's the clicking recorder and public county\nOkay John daily you traveled a different route I Seventy ... east of Denver through to Grand Junction very major artery obviously and I imagine people on that road may have a very different sense of the race for governor\nYou know it was interesting I got the sense that this race resembles the broader national political landscape most of the folks I spoke to were either strongly backing Walker Stapleton or German polish or hadn't thought about it much or didn't want to say that I talked to a few Coloradans who are totally overwhelmed by the flood of campaign ads\nAnd seem more interested frankly and talking about the Rockies aka the did you get a sense of national\nPolitics are having an effect on the governor's race I really did you know in in Jefferson County I met an educator a Hillary Clinton voter who strongly supports Jared polish\nJulie ... has been fired up by national politics and President Trump who she considers immoral she thinks Colorado needs polish and Democrats in charge here as a counterbalance to Republican control in Washington\nWe need to pull everybody we can a different direction because I mean I think the ... the the way Colorado is saying right now under Hickenlooper has been fine but I think with national politics the way they are we need to do what we can locally to combat those movements\nYeah I got a sense from the Democrats I talked to that national politics overshadows everything right now that state politics is just knocked their priority made sure they want a democratic governor but they're more concerned about making sure Democrats win more seats in Congress to counterbalance trunk\nAnd that's interesting 'cause I got a totally different than down especially in ... I didn't feel really any to that at all about the top of the ticket in this case it's the governor's race\nAnd that might be because I was talking more to Republicans and blue dog Democrat to you know didn't seem to be excited about Jared poll is what I did hear about are all these local races under like Fifteen people I think actually more than Fifteen people running for mayor in ... there's also this open county commissioner race or signs all over town and there's debates and\nSo that's really what started me down this path that sort of thinking All right well maybe there's more to the sun I originally thought and a vote the credits last name um he was so I had asthma I asked my dad and my dad said I'm not entirely sure so I'll ask your grandfather and my grandfather said oh yeah\nThat's my cousin he used to come to the family picnics and measure people's heads with caliber\nAnd always practicing so I always practicing science and was just kind of this eccentric guy and I thought All right well and he's a relative to so now I really have to do this [noise]\nWhat evidence did he find that convinced him of the creatures existence or or convinced him at at least enough to try to find out is it is yes\nSo he saw the casting of a set of footprints of ... poor plaster into a footprint on the ground you can preserve all of the detail and and that it's called the cast\nAnd he saw a set of friends that had been made up in Washington state and one of them was crippled and he said the end of the er an anatomical detail on them was so good that there is no way they could have been staked and that's what convinced him this would've been back in the seventies at some point I\nUnderstand that his widow actually lives in Colorado and Parker I think yes are you also interviewed her does she believe in big foot she does\nAnd actually that you could say that big foot played matchmaker here\nBecause she had read an article in the paper talking about how this scientist in Washington state believed in Bigfoot and he's this academic and she said well I've never\nHeard of anyone who had these kinds of credentials saying that big foot was real and so she started writing to him and then he came to Denver for a lecture and then they met and it was romance\nYou're listening to Colorado matter is I'm Ryan Warner and Denver journalist Laura ... is my guest she used to be with NPR she has a new podcast the first episode dropped today it's called wild thing and it is a serious investigation of\nThe existence of big foot of sasquatch and it is also an exploration of the popular culture surrounding this beast which I Want to get into but if he believed this anthropologist and your relative that big foot was real\nDid he have some theory about what space occupied in and a male yeah or in ... evolution or watch\nYes so Grover thought that big but it was a descendant of this giant this now extinct giant Asian ape called gigantic ... is\nThat existed you know a million years ago and his ... was it was it a descendent of that come over the bearing land straits as apparently we do yes oh well maybe we might have come and vote for that is true yes I don't know if it took about\nUm but yeah the idea was its descended from this particular species so it's a in the order primate fasten it there's a whole the second episode is all about evolution\nOkay how ingrained is sasquatch in in our popular culture which would say\nSo it's hard to really quantify it but I Will say that when I started thinking about big foot and this is probably going to happen to you now to if you're in the grocery store if you are at a bike store if you are anywhere you go you will see references to Bigfoot and sasquatch their stocks there's chocolate there's bikes there snowboards\nThere is erotica as we all know there is um there's all kinds of movies there's a publishing company and it's kind of everywhere you look\nSo there's a lot of appeal out there\nAs we all know there's erotica okay I didn't actually know that but I'm learning things from Laura ... in their series you will visit Bailey, Colorado the home of the sasquatch out post\nSo this little section here's on footprints including these trucks [noise]\nThis is our map of Colorado sasquatch sightings are big foot he recalled boomer\nAnd you'd be shocked at how many people never see this they come in the museum they walk around the leave and never even see this big switch to an air and this was a centerpiece of all museum\nTell us about the origins of this sasquatch outpost in Colorado\nSo Bailey is a tiny little sort of to horse town and this used to be the old grocery store that was there so back in the Eighteen hundreds and its shuttered many many years ago and this couple Jim and Daphne Myers bought the the grocery and turned it into sort of a grocery store slash\nBig foot thing 'cause Jim is uh he he is a very serious about Bigfoot\nUm but he also recognizes that a lot of people are fascinated by it and so it was still part grocery store and then part Bigfoot outlets kind of thing\nAnd then they realized that they could just make all of their money doing the big foot ... ... dollars yeah actually they totally ditched the degree does and they just had the sasquatch outposts where you could go and get hiking and camping gear and all kinds of sasquatch paraphernalia and then they opened a museum\nOr sasquatch discovery museum which you just heard the the sounds from that little who ding owls and stuff and they have a map in there and have some discussion of the different evidence and there's a giant big foot sort of tucked in behind a tree that if you weren't looking you might miss him which goes to show you if you were out in the woods and you weren't looking you might miss him was\nSpeaking of that when I think of big foot I think that iconic photo of him\nOr her a look\nFacing the camera a stride did you learn anything about that image\nOh my God I learned so much about that image dry so that is from the Nineteen sixty seven film called the Patterson gambling found so it was shot just over fifty years ago and I actually went to the fiftieth anniversary celebration last year which is just about a year ago\nAnd it it is a lady Bigfoot striding away through the forest\nAnd you know there's all kinds of theories about whether this is a legitimate this is actually big foot or if this is a man and a monkey suit or you know a hoax of some sort and this film which is only a minute long and it's very shaky footage\nUm it's been just analyzed to death it's been stabilized and slow down and re mastered and people have spent hours and hours and hours I said I heard one guy told me that it's been watched second only to the Kennedy assassination\nRouter fan yeah podcast of course her sound driven which got me thinking about watch sasquatch might sound like you delve into this uh I think digging up some tape from big foot research websites\n[laughter]\nLearn anything from sounds [noise]\nUm well not from hearing those particular sounds necessarily you know people will make recordings of stuff that they hear in the woods but the problem with that is unless you see what's making the sound it's often hard to know what\nIt's actually doing it and I heard several stories where people had thought they'd heard of big foot they'd recorded that they brought it into some big but to oppose them and they played it for the whole audience because they were so excited\nAnd someone's like yeah that's an elk or that's an adult so that the sounds are a little bit tough but you know they if you're out in the woods and you hear something like that and you're alone and you're camping that's going to make the hair on the back of your next end up\nHow do people answer the fundamental question that a big foot existed we would have seen it by now we just be more acquainted with especially with you know satellite imagery and as much development as there is in forest land and the growth of the population in the west\nMhm I think that is probably one of the hardest questions to answer um some people just say that it's very good at staying hidden and staying out of sight you know other people will say hey we are seeing it there are eyewitness accounts it's just people don't believe\nThem where do you want him on this more crime oh I don't know if I Want to give that away oh say that I definitely want to believe you want to believe yeah are you glad you took it on me as someone who's taking on what what some might consider more serious topics\nYeah I think this has been it's been a lot of fun I met a lot of interesting people and I mean I learned some cool science along the way\nDenver journalist ...
