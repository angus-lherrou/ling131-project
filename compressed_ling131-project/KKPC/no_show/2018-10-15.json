Harvard University goes on trial in Boston today for alleged discrimination against Asian Americans\nThe group that suing the school is called students for fair admissions and it claims the university systematically ranks Asian American applicants lower on personality characteristics Harvard denies this charge joining us our reporter Kirk Carapezza of Boston member station WBUR GBH he's been following this closely Kirk thanks for being here\nHey good morning Rachel so I just gave the broad brush stokes of what the students about that can you get more detail to what is the central allegation here\nShould the group students for fair admissions led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum is claiming that Harvard caps the number of academically qualified Asian American applicants by using these personal ratings in court the group will need to prove that Harvard is intentionally rejecting the applicants because of their age and because of their race\nI spoke with attorney ... with the Asian American legal foundation which is supporting this lawsuit changes Chinese American and he's also a Harvard graduate\nHarvard the systematically saying that Asian candidates are not likeable and don't have good personalities by orders of magnitude less than candidates of any other ethnic group which is really nothing but racist it perpetuates and feeds and create stereotypes\nHuh so just to be clear Kirk isn't so Harvard uses this personality rating system for all applicants it's just that this group is alleging that Asian American applicants are the ones who get dangerous often\nRight Rachel there the group is claiming that Harvard is using these rankings to racially balance its classes which is illegal it's unconstitutional\n[noise] so how is Harvard waiting a defense\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants ended continuously points out that Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all of them ended students and they make up just six percent of the U.S population\nAt a higher education event in Detroit last month I caught up with Harvard's new president Larry back out and he defended the colleges admissions process\nNobody wants to be judged on their numbers alone [noise] people understand and recognize that we learn from our differences that creating a diverse learning environment enriches the learning experience for every student on campus\nAnd back oh says what's at stake here is Harvard and higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he argues is central to its mission\nThe Trump Administration has come out I weighed in on this the department of justice backing the plane test is that going to make a difference\nRight last month the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's\nAdmissions process quote may be infected with racial bias here in Boston judge Allison boroughs will preside over the trial and she was nominated by President Obama back in two dozen fourteen and she's the same judge who blocked President Trump's executive order designed to ban refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries\nJudge burrows is known for her independence streak so\nI don't think she'll be swayed by the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or any other political agenda\nI mean this is about Harvard but it could this case to have an impact on the mission policies that other schools\nCivil rights leaders certainly worried about that they see this lawsuit as a direct attack on race conscious admissions which for the past forty years the Supreme Court has allowed if carefully done students for fair admissions have explicitly said their goal was to overturn that precedent and they want selective schools like Harvard to stop considering race altogether ...\nReporter Kirk Carapezza from W GBH in Boston Thanks so much Thanks Rachel\n[noise]\nUnited States air force is holding exercises in Ukraine it's the first time that has happened since Russia's military intervention in Ukraine four years ago rushing back\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no

that a bit cryptic as to what that means but obviously the first place that a lot of analysts plan was sort of I guess that that could mean using their\nPower and the world's largest oil exporter\nSo Saudi Arabia obviously can hold a large share of the oil market and there was actually a a article written by a a Saudi journalist who's right prominent in one of the state controlled media outlets a lot of beer\nAnd he suggested that you know if the u._s. isn't careful how could you know bring oil prices over a hundred dollars or over two hundred dollars and even went on to suggest that this could push Saudi Arabia and the arms that Iran you know which has been their traditional regional rival ... at the same time\nBut he officials later said that that didn't reflect their official thinking that it's not clear what they're actually you know threatening only that they felt they had to respond very strongly to the statement from President\nTrump I'm curious about that because the president is the front of the United states is talking about the Saudis seems at this point about the same way that he talks about Russia's obvious interference in the U.S election the president keeps saying well as serious if it happened but we'll see 'em they deny it or why would the Saudis feel at all threatened by the\nWell this has been a huge shift to them and it's not just about how President Trump is reacting to that there's been a really strong reaction and Washington against is um people have been cutting ties\nAnd business ties very important business ties with Saudi Arabia there's a massive investment conference who's going to be happening later this month and a\nSeveral really important names have pulled out of it to Jamie diamond from J. P. Morgan recently\nI'm Richard Branson has pulled out and also put out of another investment that he had been doing what the Saudis and there's been a really strong reaction of ... companies and from all of these companies that have really a close ties sat area under the young you know Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman so this could have\nA really strong economic effect on them ah you know they're really quite eager to have foreign investment right now that sort of build up their economy and it's part of the economic transformation ... effect here you know we saw the local stock market you know really died yesterday yeah well\nLet's talk about that because the Saudis have wanted to have this narrative of economic opening and reform\nAnd alongside that they wanted to have the appearance of greater openness it's still going to be an absolute monarchy are still going to have certain controls but they wanted women to be driving and wanted to appear to be a little more in line with the way that people have freedom and in in other countries\nAre is the royal family no longer thinking that way\nWell to be honest I think that assessment was perhaps one that was coming out of the U.S\nOver the past year but it's not necessarily accurate that you know conference on and on and his own words never called himself a reformer and what he does want is economic openness and he is talking about listening social restrictions what he's never talked about is loosening\nThat political restrictions or you know offering any kind of you know more free speech or more political openness and so there hasn't been a crackdown simultaneously on people who have been critical of the kingdom and some Saudis who are brought in critical of kingdom see this as in line with that\nAnd of course

that's suing the school is called students for fair admissions and it claims the university systematically ranks Asian American\nApplicants lower on personality characteristics Harvard denies this charge joining us our reporter Kirk Carapezza of Boston member station WBUR GBH he's been following this story closely Kirk thanks for being here hey good morning Rachel so I just gave the broad brush stokes of what the students about but can you get more detail to what is the central allegation here\nShould the group students for fair admissions led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum is claiming that Harvard caps the number of academically qualified Asian American applicants by using these personal ratings in court the group will need to prove that Harvard is intentionally rejecting the applicants because of their Asian because of their race\nI spoke with attorney ... with the Asian American legal foundation which is supporting this lawsuit changes Chinese American and he's also a Harvard graduate\nHarvard the systematically saying that Asian candidates are not likeable and don't have good personalities by orders of magnitude less than candidates of any other ethnic group which is really nothing but\nRacist it perpetuates and feeds and create stereotypes\nHuh so just to be clear Kirk isn't so Harvard uses this personality rating system for all applicants it's just that this group is alleging that Asian American applicants are the ones who get ... most often\nRight Rachel there the group is claiming that Harvard is using these rankings to racially balance its classes which is illegal it's unconstitutional\n[noise] so how is Harvard waiting a defense\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants ended continuously points out that Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all the students and they make up just six percent of the U.S population\nAt a higher education event in Detroit last month I caught up with Harvard's new president Larry back out and he defended the colleges admissions process\nNobody wants to be judged on their numbers alone [noise] people understand and recognize that we learn from our differences that creating a diverse learning environment in which is the learning experience for every student on campus\nAnd back oh says what's at stake here is Harvard and higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he argues is central to its mission\nThe Trump Administration has come out I waited on this the department of justice backing the plane test is that going to make a difference\nRight last month the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's\nAdmissions process quote may be infected with racial bias here in Boston judge Alison boroughs will preside over the trial and she was nominated by President Obama back in two dozen fourteen and she's the same judge who blocked President Trump's executive order designed to ban refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries\nJudge burrows is known for her independence streak so I don't think she'll be swayed by the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or any other political agenda\nI mean this is about Harvard but it could this case have an impact on the mission policies at other schools\nCivil rights leaders certainly worried about that they see this law suit as a direct attack on race conscious admissions which for the past forty years the Supreme Court has allowed is carefully done students for fair admissions subjects supposedly said their goal was to overturn that precedent and they want selective schools like Harvard to stop considering race altogether ...\nReporter Kirk Carapezza from W GBH in Boston Thanks so

are concerned enough about injuries that they're not allowing them at all\nWhen they enter the sector of transportation that's also entering the sector public health so it becomes a different ball game and we need to make sure that we're doing it safely\nIn San Francisco Juilliard as part of the city's injury prevention collaborative which is collecting data on Easter injuries are they happening at particular intersections our people fracturing skulls or sprained ankles or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others\nSo you have to look at the patterns to see where the trends are and where the low hanging fruit are\nAs a trauma surgeon Juilliard has seen the dangers but she also sees the potential because San Francisco is a city dealing with a lot of car traffic and

time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off from a public agency standpoint that we think is a good one I don't know we don't know yet\nPortland of course does not want the rise and injuries they're handing out free helmets and doing a public education campaign\nBut you only have to look at the ... going by to see that this is a big change Carson scooters are still learning how to be around each other and not many people are wearing helmets cities and physicians will get

know what happened to missing Saudi journalist ... he vanished after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Turkish officials believe he was killed their President Trump says he spoke with Saudi Arabia's king who strongly denied any link with ... disappearance\nHe didn't really know lazy I don't want to get his size sits out at me like ... ... getting a bottom of the first ... as long as a flat denial\nIn an interview last night Trump had said Saudi Arabia will face consequences if it is behind the journalists disappearance but Saudi Arabia mediate we hit back now and that if the kingdom received any sanction it will respond with greater action\nWith two days ago before crucial some it's about the United kingdom's exit from the European Union talks between both sides are stalled NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from London, UK prime minister Theresa May is having trouble reaching a breakfast in agreement with the EU and her own cabinet\nSticking point is ever you how to avoid a hard border which would divide Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. and the republic of Ireland which will remain part of the new prime minister may wants to put all solving the difficult problem by keeping the u._k. inside of the customs area but the European Union for a set period of time\nThank you what threat to the Saudis made and response\nWell the Saudi Government issued quite a strong but also vague statement last night that essentially threatened a you know that they would respond to any measure against them with an even stronger measure\nNow they kept that a bit cryptic as to what that means but obviously the first place that a lot of analysts plant was sort of I guess that that could mean using their\nPower as the world's largest oil exporter so Saudi Arabia obviously can hold a large share of the oil market and there was actually a\nA article written by a a a Saudi journalist who's right prominent in one of the state controlled media outlets a lot of beer\nAnd he suggested that you know if uh the u._s. isn't careful how could you know bring oil prices over a hundred dollars or over two hundred dollars and even went on to suggest that this could push Saudi Arabia and the arms of Iran which has been their traditional regional rival\nAh at the same time Saudi officials later said that that didn't reflect their official thinking okay so it's not clear what they're actually you know threatening only that they felt they had to respond very strongly to the statement from President\nTrump I'm curious about that because the president is the ... states is talking about the Saudis it seems at this point about the same way that he talks about Russia's obvious interference in the U.S election the president keeps saying well as serious if it happened but we'll see 'em they deny it why would the Saudis feel at all threatened by that\nWell this has been a huge shift to them and it's not just about how President Trump is reacting to it there's been a really strong reaction and Washington against is\nUm people have been cutting ties at business ties very important business ties with Saudi Arabia there's a massive investment conference is going to be happening later this month and a\nSeveral really important names have pulled out of it to Jamie diamond from J. P. Morgan very recently\nI'm Richard Branson has pulled out and also put out of another investment that he had been doing with the Saudis so there's been a really strong reaction is actually from ... company then from all of these companies that have really\nHad close ties to Saudi Arabia under the young you know Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mine so this could have a really strong economic effect on them ah you know they're really quite eager to have foreign investment right now that sort of build up their economy and it's part of the economic transformation and it hadn't quite in effect here you know we saw the local stock market you know slow really died yesterday\nYeah well let's talk about that because the Saudis have wanted to have this narrative of economic opening and reform\nAnd alongside that they wanted to have the appearance of greater openness it's still going to be an absolute monarchy are still going to have certain controls but they wanted women to be driving and wanted to appear to be a little more in line with the way that the people who have freedom and in in other countries\nThat use the royal family no longer thinking that way\nWell to be honest I think that that assessment was perhaps one that was coming out of the U.S over the past year but it's not necessarily accurate that you know ... and his own words never called himself a reformer\nAnd what he does want is economic openness and he is talking about listening social restrictions what he's never talked about is loosening that political restrictions or offering any kind of you know more free speech or more political openness and so\nThere has been a crackdown simultaneously on people who have been critical of the kingdom\nAnd some Saudis who are abroad and critical of kingdom sees this as in line with that\nAnd of course this killing his alleged killing wouldn't be in line with that as well Vivian near I'm of Bloomberg thanks so much really appreciate it thank you
