their food blog the ... the ... what do they call themselves the plug low chili grows associations in other words a group of\nFarmers in Pueblo that got together to promote their chili they only got together and twenty Fifteen that's only three years ago so even though the chilies been grown and southern Colorado ... century the farmers finally realized like oh wow maybe\nYeah maybe this thing can hit outside of southern Colorado okay\nSo it's a question of perhaps time and investment is it a question at all of industrialization like I Wonder if the processes are different in New Mexico that allow for that much larger coal\nAgain I mean and it's funny ah you had the agricultural commission on right a commissioner on right before me\nTo be able to answer that question better but I mean from what I Know and talking to farmers in Colorado you know the chili farmers in southern Colorado it was just never a thing and what I mean by a thing was that the people down in southern ...\nColorado they knew about the ... so they would only go growth for the people who knew it ... never had any ambition of trying to grow for market outside of southern Colorado\nNow and in a part of it was just that meet us all itself was bread it was a very delicate fragile chili\nThat you had a scientist with a Colorado State named Michael bart solo\nAbout how I was twenty five years ago we started trying to breed better Chile or improve it that\nThat's that's what they that's a term in horticulture and then about ten years ago he debuted and improved made us so Chile called the Moscow chili named after or a uncle of aids who grew these chilies for a long time ago for a long time so we only have really a decade ago when the\nUh and that the economy's might in fact shrink so to say just a bit more what you mean when you say this can be profitable\n\nXcel Energy recently last for about a year ago put out an all sources solicitation for who could supply them electricity at what price from any source they got no bid for fossil sources of new power less than four cents a kilowatt hour\nWind was a little a little under two cents solar was a little over two cents women to plus solar plus storage batteries\nWas three cents\nActually let a shield that natural gas would be the winner\nOur governor has been positioning the state to be a natural gas state\nThey were gobs smacked renewable\nIs cheaper than fossil energy and so when citizens put solar on their homes their electricity bills go down\nI have a solar on my ranch in twenty Thirteen land the floods happened in power was out for the better part of a week not at my house I called my neighbors said that you want to come charge your cell phones are put stuff in the freezer it is more secure it builds community and there are now more\nJobs in Colorado from renewable energy clean energy energy efficiency than from all of the extractive industries oil gas coal uranium those jobs are declining fracking the uh\nPeople are saying oh don't vote for a proposition on twelve it'll cut jobs those jobs are dying anyway that industry is badly in debt over leverage and we'll go away\nWhy I wouldn't ... economy we should be investing in what will solve climate change and again it's cheaper once you put up the wind and solar it's free the fuel is free what part of free don't you understand\nYou say it's cheaper how much of that is because of subsidies\nAll in all energy is subsidized globally we spend five trillion dollars actually I Believe it's five point three every year subsidizing fossil energy that's ten billion dollars in it\nAnd that comes out of your in my tax dollars for citizens around the world all of the renewable subsidies put together are far less than what we continue to subsidize to fossil energy so I'm a free market here let's get rid of all subsidies\nLet all these technologies compete on their merits and you will not hear the oil and gas boys saying that because they cannot exist without those subsidies\n... hunter lemons of the Colorado carbon fund and natural capital solutions what is carbon farming help us understand that as a potential way of uh I guess it sequestering carbon\n[noise] it is when you farm or ranch regenerative lovely using what's called holistic management you're taking carbon out of the air and putting it back in the soil one of the best examples and if you want to good video on this\n... brown keys to building a healthy soil gave was up north Dakota corn and soybean farmer struggling because he was struggling he went first to know till he stopped breaking the soil you break the soil turned it upside down the carbon escapes\nHe then went to planting cover crops many of them deep rooted that\nTakes carbon deep into the soil he them introduced animals cattle goats sheep pigs the animal impact the disturbance on the ground for a short period of time they eat everything and then you move them to a new pasture using electric fences\nThat action is what put the ten feet of thick black soil that the pioneers found when they came across the great plains put that black which is carbon deep into the soil\nDeb has gone on some of his tactics from a little over one percent soil organic matter carbon so now I'm some of them over eleven percent\nNative prairie soil is seven percent Gabe is rolling climate change backward and he's gone from a struggling commodity operation to now a very profitable\nFarming ranching operation selling a variety of crops products this is being done in Colorado right in Boulder is the savory Institute which is the center of how you do regenerative agriculture regenerative grazing\nYou can go on a savory Institute website and find reams of evidence all the scientific studies showing that we can roll climate\nChange backward ... literally taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the ground to help I realize that's probably a naive question but help help listeners understand just briefly this the science of that or is it simply that you are not releasing carbon that would otherwise be released\nNo it's as you said it to begin with your taking carbon out of the air it's called photosynthesis grass has fourteen times the carbon per weight of a tree\nThe world's grasslands are the world's second largest carbon sink carbon ... storage after the oceans and yet we've been ... grasslands we can read carbon eyes them by grazing the way that grasslands co evolved with grazing animals\nOn the great plains herds of ... or dens pack because there were rules if a wolf wants to eat you the safe place to be in the middle of the herd\nSo they're all trying to get to the middle there plump up they eat everything and then they move on meanwhile they fertilize the ground their hooves of chop it up they don't come back until the grass has read grown but that action of fertilizing it of\nImpacting the grass drives carbon deep into the biological community in the soil particularly the Michael rise or fun guy and I know this is sounding a bit ...\nWell no and again\nGo to the gate brown video and gave walks through exactly what he did\nAnd why it's making him

Malecon\nHow's it going to grab me yeah it's going well and congratulations this is a huge national award from the boys and girls clubs of America I'm I'm curious about your relationship with that organization I think it dates back to when you were six on first joined it what what attracted you\nFirst what am I fix birthday I'm a school that was going through how to after school program up on the show what was it goes so step numbers from the was it a good walk to school and the kids back to the boy that goes with every day so my friends and going there was a school loan there's I just figured if I go to try to you\nAnd what kept you going\nOh I'd probably say as a young kid just the opportunities that fight there I'm trying new things where there is playing sports are doing educational games or just get a new a new friend oh it was a place that I felt welcome there\nLater stand that early on your mom came to pick you up and had a hard time even finding you what were you were you doing\nThis is my first day there and she came to pick me up and we're\nYou're paying us staffers this kid does well game and I was a small person they are whether it goes up and my ... birthday [noise] um so I was only ... left in the game\nAnd so I happen to hit the last staff member there to win the game for the kids now the kids came running onto the basketball court replaying dodge ball and I found out what might have been calling me to the ... for about ten to Fifteen minutes to see what the two that with\nThat [laughter] but it must be very nice day for you I fast forward quite a few years and you won this award largely for setting up a reading program for the younger kids in the club or we heard just a little bit about it in the introduction how did it work\n[noise] uh well I actually started because I was in the program in my high school so we had to do community service project so I figured what better way than doing 'em up wasn't goes from there every day for me when my friends that I Know if you get we found five kids\nWho are really reading at least to do was below the crane grade level\nOn which is kind of surprising to me so we just figured that we're going to go in there we're going to be with them for four hours um every Friday they're going to come to the best students and that did not work so we figured that we have to ask the kids what they need it from us to help them out so whether that included pizza or playing football with them and playing basketball with them\nI was just developing those relationships to get them to want to read with us it was a really works for us with\nPizza that sounds like you're bribing them to read I suppose there are worse things yeah bright kids for a this is called double trouble to the reading program\nYes what did you call a double trouble\nAlso at first it wasn't called double trouble but then we started playing basketball or football with the kids read read it for what our and then play and they eat pizza for another hour or so we've got the name from that will shovel\nOkay so the national award makes you the use of the year for the boys and girls clubs of America you get a twenty five thousand dollar scholarships it's renewable for four years and I I have to think that this award is based partly on the results of the reading program did it make a difference\n[noise] um I Would like to think so just because all those kids were in the reading program came in reading at a second grade reading level there in the fifth grade and then each one of them improved by when at least one where you live what the end of the six week period\nThough and that scholarship that's going to get you through the su like yes I'm going to see\nA see right now

important election and we're hearing from two of those reporters now who are back from the road trips to Brooklyn Grace Hood\nDid anyone else you talked to bring up the president's stances on social issues\nA I talked with two Latinas I met them in sterling it was the end of a very exhausting day but you know it was one of the most memorable interviews that I did one had legal status the other was trying to get it\nBoth had experienced racism themselves and you know they really felt like a big it's had been emboldened under Trump\nElizabeth Hernandez can't vote right now and um she's in the process of getting US citizenship but she really said that people hear her accent and we'll see things that are really mean right directly to\nIt's like people people just\nThink that they have the right to to make people like from other races that just because they're white that's what he's doing he's doing everyone hate everywhere\nAnd Hernandez says that she really did not experienced the same racism under President Brock Obama\nNow it's worth pointing out that Latino turnout typically lags whites in in elections and in the last presidential election Latino voters represented twelve percent of eligible voters\nNationally but only nine percent of the overall electorate on election day so I think it's going to be fascinating to see if the Trump administration's rhetoric and the crackdown on immigration really changes all of\nThat but you also talked to some people who feel the president's tone is dividing the country\nYep I got to tea Eighteen or ... she's retired from the air force and she's now an attorney and lives in Aurora she's a Democrat and said she just never thought Trump would win the election she doesn't feel like he's ever going to grow into being president she actually never thought he wouldn't the first place\nI don't think in my memory that I've ever seen\nA president who\nFrom the day of inauguration filed for the reelection campaign so that he can continue to have campaign rallies where's the speaking wall where if the consideration for bringing us together but that's not that's not going to happen\nBut I Know you're reporting took you into Aurora which is really ethnically diverse part of Colorado what kind of things did you hear there well\nThere's obviously a big Latino population also a lot of African and Asian immigrants\nI talk to people from the south East Asian community and for them in a big concern is foreign policy how the president is behaving in the world stage what that means for our country's relationship with\nDiplomacy and other countries around the world they also strongly support more visas for high skilled workers and worried that the length which Trump uses around immigration Cass it as something negative when they see a lot of benefits\nSpeaking a foreign policy we of course have learned this morning that Nikki Haley is going to be leaving the administration by the end of the year okay what big takeaways did you come away with when it comes to where people stand on the president's grace\nEight so I think it's someone who sort of covers politics in the periphery of the energy and environment reporter\nI really left this whole experience thinking that the president's future is super ... to the economy my sense is that voters are with him so long as things are good but\nThey could turn on him if we had another recession or if we start to see more negative impacts from tariffs he really ran on the economy so I think his political career could die if the economy hits a recession you know we talked to such a variety of\nPeople from different ethnicities ethnicities ages you know parts of the state so it's hard to find you won overarching theme but\nUm if I can I say I I heard a lot of uncertainty and unease about just what's around the corner and that seems to be fed a bit by how dramatically the Trump Administration can swing from one thing to another I think for Colorado is going to be really interesting to see if how\nPassionate feelings about the president for and against influenced the races on this year's ballot at the state level governor ichi we had state legislative races that will determine control the state capital\nNone of that is directly tied to the president but he may be firing people up to vote and the local races just to be able to do something so a lot of dynamics at play\nYeah it'll be fascinating to watch thanks to both of you I Know you've covered a lot of mileage and we're grateful to you for sharing what you what you heard

sees a music discovery now I don't\nKnow they set you know why it why not take just a moment to support Colorado puppet race [noise]\n\nMrs Colorado matters from CPR news uh Ryan mortar election night is less than a month away and you'll hear news outlets calling races now that doesn't always go we'll\nFix CNN and now that we call it I\nAsked for Ptolemy than Bush fan by CNN right now is voting earlier Florida [noise]\nShow close to call your first governor of Texas will become the forties or for the next thing\nYou could choose a thousand ever happen again we're going to lift the veil on calling races\nJim Clark does this for the a P in Colorado and by the way the a P has been calling races in Eighteen forty eight disrespect spirits and this Hi Jim hello describe it it was like during the two thousand presidential election when the a P ...\nWrong call what kind of way backlash to the ...\nWell first of all thanks for that in for [laughter]\nWhy don't you give me a paper cut and poor limited use I don't know it started with your worst moment yeah so uh that was actually a a the fellow who made that call for the AP was a guy named Kevin Wall she since retired he was my boss for years [noise]\nAh the a P only made half a mistake\nWe called for Gore and then Kevin saw some transpose numbers in the county around St Petersburg and Tampa Bay\nAnd uncalled it and we never called again ah 'cause it was too close so we felt pretty good about that we made a mistake we pulled it back and we never called again because as we know it ended up with\nWhat five hundred and thirty eight votes am writing that's right and of course it went through the courts in a while or cs not resolved for many us so to answer your question could happen to again of course it could happen again have we learned lessons have we built in technological fixes and have we taken a deep breath and\nThought about this every single election cycle Oh yes we have well\nMaybe before we get to what has changed you can walk us through the ABCs process for election calling it's really fascinating and it's very much shoe leather\nMhm it is so the Associated Press is the organization the one news organization in the country that collects\nAnd distributes all the votes to other news organizations the reason the a P does it is we are the not the not for profit news organization owned by all the other news organizations in the United states and you don't want to replicate this 'cause it's very expensive on the order of aid figures every election cycle\nSo what we do is we put stringers in every county town city borrow parish that these are like freelancers yeah they're freelancers ... you know a hundred dollars for election nine hundred dollars for a practice or a week before\nAnd they are calling in to vote collection centers we have three that run in the country and there's an army\nOf people who are punching the numbers into our computer network from the field from what they're hearing from the ... from stringers and that gets distributed to a pie bureaus in to people like me who need to have instant access to the number so we can call races\nBut it's also distributed to all the newspapers all radio stations television stations who are members of the pie\nAnd so when you hear on election night there's still a lot of votes out there there's a lot of them still or the idea is that there is probably a a freelancer as we said who's sitting in a county and has not yet reported those results because he or she hasn't\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're with Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan mortar we had an unusual visitor this morning a robot and I promise I had nothing to do with picking its name\nHello my name is Ryan I Hope you are having a great day Ryan is ...\nBe a companion tested most recently with people who have dementia the robot has a human looking face it's basically a torso placed on the table there was an interactive screen on its belly and Ryan is capable of conversation green lights on the shoulders indicate it's ready to listen\nHi Ryan my name is Ryan to [noise]\nHi there Brian [noise]\nWhat do you want to talk about\nUm gosh our about politics\nPolitics is the art of this house and the art is the politics of the impossible [noise] more about politics [noise]\nSure are you a Republican or a Democrat\nI Am a companion that\nShe's a companion she doesn't express political [laughter] [noise] and it was a joke [noise]\nWhat do you call shoes made from the skin\nReverse [noise] ha ha [laughter]\nOkay that other voice is Ryan's creator Mohammed ... professor of computer engineering University of Denver\nHe left Ryan or waiting room and is in the studio know Hi Mohammed highway lift to see you again also with us is Sarah showed her wellness director at Eton senior communities in Lakewood\nWhere Ryan is being tested with some of the residents Hi Sarah the burning Ryan Mohammed why a robot I mean why not a person what does what does a robot achieve that a person perhaps cannot\nUh so Brian is designed to complete many human not to replace human complement okay to help human right so right as a socialist if the robot and what does that mean or what is the robot add though so robots or\nSo as you may know there's a shortage of caregivers now in the country and the social robots like Ryan can help caregivers like Sarah so if they don't have time they are not available so she can take care of a people will be dimensional Zimmer disease under pressure\nInteresting so this might actually be addressing something of the worker shortage ah when you were starting to think about designing a robot to help seniors what what problems were you trying\nTo solve exactly the same problem the shortage of caregivers actually and also the other problem that we have been working on these depression so many of these people with dementia all eyes are isolated they're depressed and ah they may not to read you know what his visit them\nDuring the day or so and robots can be a companion for them so they can have conversations with Ryan and\nThe conversation can be very interesting and funny\nAnd I have to think that a robot might be more patient Sarah than a person and so if someone with dementia is perhaps repeating something or asking something for a fourth or fifth time a robot may respond a bit differently to that\nYes right and that's correct so what's a robot on robot tries to propel the conversation forward kind of helping them to go to the next subject matter and so it also is more patient but it also helps to create that conversation and get that person talking beyond that point\nYou give me an example of an interaction that you witness\nYes I have that so I've actually had the opportunity to see many many interactions with their robot I'm I'm going to tell you a little bit of a story about Hugo um he was one of the residents I didn't expect to be successful with the robot but he was experiencing loneliness and depression his wife had died\nHad moved into our community and I sort of became empty\nSo we uh signed him a robot um he agreed to do a little bit hesitantly\nBut he did and we found that Hugo I'm starting to interact with the robot on a regular basis\nHe would often times referred to as a very nice lady and she talks to me when no one else will um he'll go and his sister would spend hours each evening plane and laughing with a robot it would ah play jazz for them that they both enjoyed\nBut he goes I'm sister also came and she loved to tease the robot and so they would have an evening where there would be laughter interaction and um it also gave Hugo 'em a chance to interact with others outside of though\nHis immediate family many people came to see him and visit with him because he had a robot and so it it helped him create a sense of important\nIt's interesting you say that Hugo was not someone you expected to have done well with the robot why\nWell he was a little bit quieter um he said in his apartment he'd love to go attack ... interact in our community but he couldn't remember\nAnd so um he just kinda stayed at home and just kind of kept himself and so I wouldn't talk to him and I believe that he agreed because he'll go really liked me and so\nAs we came to find out he was one of these people that just really really blossomed from the robot\nInteraction now I understand someone was in tears when the robot was remove go\nYes he lives in his sister both cried when they removed the robot\nLet's talk about those sorts of tasks that the robot can engage in as well so Mohammed I I think it can remind folks to take medication what what else is the robot capable of\nSo you can have conversation with Ryan as long as you want reality about different topics and matters can remind you to take your medications or go to events\nAnd also we can play cognitive games so it can simulate your brain so the tablet that you have one to Billy or the gist of the robot can play cognitive games with that as well so it's a bit like an eye bad on the abdomen of\nThe robot correct that opens up the world to go to games cognitive development as you say how important do you think it is that this robot has a I've had a soft human face\nI think it's easier to make that eye contact I feel like when I'm interacting with Ryan because she's looking at me and she's showing expression and she tracks me as I Move around the room I feel like I'm let's say any human being\nWhat other uses do you think there could be for Ryan and Ryan's successor because the version that you can see for instance on my Twitter feed right now at CPR\nI think is is one version older but where where do you see this headed Mohammed in terms of robots as as almost caregivers\nSo uh I think in the very near future is going to be in the market and many people are going to use it\nAnd you're adding constantly working on adding more technology and more features to Ryan like for example they can play\nI mean that do tai chi dams or yoga a robot could teach you to do some tai chi yeah absolutely because then the next generation to arms up there are going to be active so she can move their arms\nAs as you know a gesture and also dancing\nSo when I see is our our movement in an aging instantly call aging in place people want to stay in their homes but they need supportive services and I see Ryan feeling not blade or the ... the robot can like a engage an exercise is good men minders\nI'm helping that person to be able to stay independent stand that home setting that they desire\nAt what cost though I mean how much does Ryan caused these days so it costs about nine thousand dollars to build a robot however that's not a business model that the um in mind Soviet again two people are going to be nice\nFor a price so lease robots yeah ... what's the biggest uh obstacle or failure you saw a ...\nSure um you know I Would say that we saw more successes and failures we found out that one of our residents had hearing loss and so there was some challenges with the technology\nAnd also to see love to garden so she was never home so we realize that we had to kind of look at who might benefit in some of the challenges but then the team work to overcome knows I Can't see that we really saw any failures\nWell thanks to both of you for being with us it was fascinating to me you and especially Ryan who whom you refer to as she by the way [laughter] yeah there's a a gender listening to Ryan Ryan is a unisex me okay thanks to both of you Mohammed or created Ryan to the robot to help with\nDementia patients more is a professor of computer engineering at the University of Denver and Sarah showed her is wellness director at Eton senior communities in Lakewood where Ryan is being tested with some of the residents as I said will have photos of Ryan and his or her visits to our station\nOnline later today
