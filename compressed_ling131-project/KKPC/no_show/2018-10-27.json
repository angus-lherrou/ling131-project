more than two hundred thousand to fast food restaurants that's not by accident Dr Andrew Weil\nThis history of Americans being told that manufactured food was somehow better for them or you know I think this happened in the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties ones among these these processed foods came when the market or they were seen as being modern and up to date and as well as labor saving\nAnd talk about easy she just pops he they tried to Dennis in a lot of you know there are up and ready and individual heat 'n serve trade you just eat and serve as you served vegan hearty with friendship gravy\nGarden first fears of more butter mother Murphy\nIf you look at fast food in particular it is remarkable to me that when you put American fast food down anywhere in the world people gravitate toward it I did a lot of research on healthy aging in Okinawa, Okinawa has some of them\nKnow that has the highest longevity in the world and among those interesting very diets are great for fusion of land vegetables see vegetables\nA fish and all sorts of things are in the years that I made a number of visits to hook and all over about seven years and then the time of economic longevity plummeted especially among men was attributed entirely to the rapid popularity of American type fast food\nSomething in the combination of fat salt in crunch which purveyor of fast food apparently have mastered seemed to carry widespread appeal even when surfed up in ways that can damage our health\nAnd the other issue which is often not discussed is that over the past fifty Seventy years uh and the taste of food has declined as we as a result of\nA dependence and agriculture on very limited number of varieties like the red delicious apple for example or breeding of chickens for a rapid weight gain at the expense of flavor and in response to this loss of flavor in food\nThere has grown up a multi billion dollar industry and flavor additives are and these are in everything and we don't know some of these chemicals are natural some of them are synthetic summer somebody synthetic\nBut we really know nothing about their effects alone or in combination they're not listed on the labels are just conceal mom do the general heading you know flavors and spices\nUm but they could have very profound effects on physiology and we wanted the drivers of obesity in America\nAnd or national weight problem poses a serious public health concern according to the CDC Ninety three million Americans are about four in ten or obese\nHealth consequences can include heart disease stroke type two diabetes and certain kinds of cancer the estimated annual medical costs to the United states is one hundred forty seven billion dollars\nThere's lots of reasons why America became an obese nation\nSusan Roberts born in Britain is uh\nScientist at Tufts University where she serves as professor of nutrition and professor of psychiatry\nAnd we have changing societal norms we'd have changed since ... production [noise]\nWe have all kinds of changes it's not a you know I Need to feed industries felt if my ... in my opinion\nBut the fact is today we had gone and in a toxic food environment where we can eat anytime overeating is on this just to set feet and unhealthy food and when food is in front of people and excessively available they each you know just in the moment that\nFood attracts you to get a neurological response to seeing the food\nAnd you find yourself hungry or on satisfied and you have that food you gain weight and then you gain more weight\nAnd life in time that white cane changes your metabolism um to to basically protect the state you get insulin resistance which means your\nHunger is more intense experience you have to eat when you need to eat and so once you've gained a lot of weight healthy food is just not appealing and found as satisfying like less it's less satisfying it's less appealing\nYou will gravitate towards the unhealthy high calorie refined choices that maintain the state becomes a very negative cycle\nProfessor Robert ... directs the energy metabolism laboratory at tops the study or eating behaviors to help people manage their

growing up in families where the parents are obese the kids being fed obese you know promoting food will lead childhood\nThey look on the streets as being normal as opposed to occasional traits that

there are dangers in consuming too much protein federal dietary guidelines which are updated every five years now recommend that particularly men and boys about half the population should reduce their protein intake\nBut American meat eating is on the rise\nAverage consumers are on track to eat more than two hundred pounds of red meat\nPoultry per year I think people in this culture eat too many animal products ah I don't tell people to become complete vegetarians but I think it'd be very useful for most people to reduce their consumption of animal foods is very solid research showing that\nAh the more red meat that people eat the increase in all cause mortality\nI'm an ... beef is a particular problem that we eat too much too much of\nA by thing would be very useful for people to

the fact is that that many people can't afford fruits and vegetables on the government could easily you can't have the government telling us eat more fruits and vegetables and at the same time you know working to make the cheap commodity foods\nAvailable we we we have made the unhealthy foods cheapest and most available people eat what is cheap and wants to al and vegetables and fruits are simply out of the price range of many people\nAt the same time America has long had a strong fascination with high end cuisine\nAnd this one is it an duck had today and if you make one of these concoction Z in the dish which is called the caffeine and fish it's goldie tending\nAnd if you're a little bit like this one it's just like to say but they're somewhat interchangeable sales of cookbooks\nAre at an all time high and audiences for cooking shows on television are off the charts and fewer people are cooking the number\nSo people must be using these cookbooks as coffee table or bathroom reading and uh the TV shows or entertainment doesn't translate into what's being done at home the statistics that I've seen on how few\nAmerican families sit down to even one home cooked meal in a week are pretty dismal\nWhy do you think that's happening [noise]\nWell I I you you people say they don't have time to cook that's a major one or it's too much trouble or they don't know how to do it that that's beyond them and I think in some ways the cooking shows reinforced that that it makes it looks as if this is the realm of professional chefs who have all this knowledge\nAnd to be very exotic\nYeah has to be very exotic I'm One of our initiatives that are center is to figure out how to get more people back into the kitchen cooking\nAnd to show people you know it is possible to learn how to make quick simple easy inexpensive dishes that are healthy and you can make these in quantity that will last for a week you don't have to master a whole huge number of them if you can get

things that I remind\nPeace or a list just to clarify tens servings a day ...\nForgot that sounds like an insane amount until you remember what a serving sizes which we often also have a ... big apple big granny apple might be two servings of fruit\nAnd a a large salad like you might get with lunch could be five servings if it's a big salad or three or four if it's a smaller salad and so\nUm you know I I Know a lot of health conscious people wear a salad with some protein is what are their meals either lunch or dinner and that's the way of getting a lot of vegetables and fruits you probably have to have some at every meal to make this work so I personally like to have for breakfast I Know people eat vegetables with their breakfast [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWe're exploring the health effects of

food I take great pleasure in that\nDr Andrew Weil\nI was laughing 'cause I remember one time I had a group of medical students come to my home and uh I took them out to my garden and I had some beautiful broccoli that was almost ready to pick\nAnd I remember this one students eyes bugged out that he had no conception that broccoli grew on a plant I don't know what he thought but I think he thought maybe usually pulled up like a beep from the ground are hung from a tree he just had never imagined that here was this thing where these foods to sing in a store that was growing on a plant\nA

I would be happy to consult\nWith you on that or you call a an agricultural extension service uh one of the universities and they'll tell you how to do it\nClearly my broccoli technique needs some improvement but when I'm able to get to the guard knife had success with other vegetables and fruits and it's kind of fun to be out there cultivating the planes and even more fun to be plucking that fresh produce for dinner\nYou can grow a really remarkable amounts of food and relatively small space so even a small backyard space even in window boxes I'm very satisfying to do that the taste of\nFreshly harvested vegetables is amazing a ... you know often uh\nI I Love to cook and I love to cook for people and I don't like complicated preparations you know fairly simple things in both

look at it be the program for these election they just talking about\nIncreasing resources for areas like education health which are very important but K ... well\nWe will talk about that in a bit ... in a bit more details of the moment but I just want to think about the the backdrop to this election you have say president dude I Do the ... president who is embroiled in corruption finds himself in prison his successor Jill I'm a recess who was impeached\nSuggests to lose a two factors the economy corruption the face of these two leaders that ... has affected this election enormously but what about the other two things that are going on that it's all about crime and the conduct of this election crime is an enormous feature present in life and Brazilian concern\nFor the for addressing this topic and I take a step back and with all due respect to ... go I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others it's not working any longer to the ... the\nFirst one to scandal when the cyclical a corruption skin was discovered\nThat the tea reacted the shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if they were parts of the conspiracy against the tea\nThen when a before that when the economy started going down they said that they shifted the blame to the external environment so a yearly this this this rhetoric is not working any longer just looked at the polls and people are not buying the story and they won't\nLet me let me throw food then let's talk about how crime and we'll talk about how this election is being conducted how those affecting how Brazilians think about which way tonight\nCrime has become endemic in Brazil the reach of homicides in Brazil\nA has reached record levels in the last years and now we have three homicides for one hundred thousand inhabitants what puts Brazil among the most violent countries in the world\nHas close ties to the country's current military leadership Brazil lived on drip ministry dictatorship for more than two decades\nIt came to an end owning in Nineteen eighty five\n... ... what do you think uh both in our government would look like would it have a minute terrific aspect\nCertainly he has had many military advisors or his vice presidential candidate is a ... a recently retired military general but it's worth remembering that he in fact approached sudden traditional politicians to join his ticket and they were refused so the military was certainly have\nMore influence in government\nHe's likely to appoint ministers who are retired military men but the military in the sense of the currently operating armed forces I think at this point the U.S to trying to not get drawn into let's say this new adventure [laughter] your warmth\nMonica who to do think it's less sacrificing perhaps some of Brazil's democratic credentials if that ... and security by moving closer to the ministry\nThe fact that he is a form of military that in itself\nFor many people raise flags but you know I think that the military can be very helpful in many areas of ... of you need we need stronger\nThe fans saw in the in our borders right I Would hope that the fight against drug trafficking will take place on the borders and not in the middle of the cities\nBut it's that ... is that Brazil's biggest problem and what is it is because a lot of the weapons we were getting a lot of the trade of weapons is just huge and\nAnd and they are the tree or is that a role for the police\nOr the borders for the military and I've heard from people from fighting to contain that they also want to use the military for infrastructure projects in the interior of the country which the military has expertise right I'm moderate\nDon't know is that is that usual to have the ... would it be welcome do you think in any country to have to admit it tri ... involved in in in the interior\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presence in the Amazon and such adopt extend the sort of\nNationalist view of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the border\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society I think the more important distinction however about the role of the military he's on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist attitude to where it's growth and development\nThe Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most to boost Brazil's development and I think Shia international markets have got to slightly I think or do\nThey think that both tomorrow will be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet uh then I don't see how they can expect to realize this sort of economic liberal version but his economic advisor ... stokes about\n... jak there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is if you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on it's just the need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many interviews acknowledging that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of undecided vision of the country in the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption democracies associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHis government is clearly one that the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending he's already has a plan to reduce\nThe number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team they have a very clear record of being very pro market in front of you in early ...\nCentury Monica nothing is very clear about what you\nJust made me more room for ... well on on the governor\nFor eight years I don't know how this things worse and realize this coalition has been put together hastily right and you have different groups that do not necessarily see eye to eye\nUh in various issues and I think a doctor mark through is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic one side of the military and\nThe liberal routine which has been gathering around the economist in a previously announced\nFinance minister Paolo geared let's see how this story on the program an old programs are\nDeliberately vague\nFor us I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called headquarters of his campaign what we have to judge if you read the two programs right and I think there is a stark contrast between this program ... projects [noise]\nThat's what we go for the one hand I understand what you're saying that the ... wants to bring power that is really that you put them to the past what are they going to be faithful I understand that\nBut clearly that's how the business community in Brazil believes as well and you see that in ... just how the stock market and the other behaves when he became a including his lead and then you end up homeless remains\nIt remains to be seen markets are my authored by nature\nNow you know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving\nOut again you know today if I can bring you and there is there is there a nude\nAbout which makes it difficult for the PC well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil the old days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the states in our lives\nWe have two different very different projects are we face two very different approach in one side we have a few of those so narrow himself as a liberal surrounded by ministry a nationalist on the other side it has a dodge who has a\nKind of a developmental list approach to the economy where this stage or to have a presence [noise] so what we have every zoo is is most states versus I stayed there where we intervene in the economy to create jobs and to form and the economy more people have in jobs\nMarket we spend money and ... that there is in an economy\nFrom is that they don't start they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than the world bank and they compete with the banking system rotting front that that's why\nYou have to get big daffy with I don't know they can land they kept the brash\nDaughters when he called on his ... well established companies giving loans like very low interest rates\nMorning as an example you said that uh both in our own makes very clear comments actually not for example initially they talk about getting a second stokes about privatization of state owned enterprises and then of course both tomorrow immediately boats in and say oh yeah yeah yeah privatization mocked knocked\nMetro bras not generations or the electorate Ross Perot says almost on the brink of going for privatization is not going to be halted\nIt's all very conditioned maybe ... ... talk has been liberal but I feel the practice when not to be liberal it will be intervention okay because that's the way Brazil has developed let me just Brazil's development history\nLet you hold on to those two quite distinct views of which way the economy may go I Want to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talked about traditional family values very tough on crime and so on\nThere is a memory of course of Brazil's minute she dictatorship which is still rule now when the repression that followed that\nThere were hundreds of people would disappear do killed many more were detained and tool shed\nAnd honesty Lewis pasta Nineteen Seventy nine which meant that when they public reckoning on trials about what had happened in those twenty ... years and today the majority of Brazil's though says is about a hundred and forty seven million of them they didn't live through that but at the regime which came to an end in eighty five\nAnd you documentary the may ... tells the story of a dictatorship bureau women's president's op how the ... is the film's director and she explain more about the tower\nApple hopeful that this song and that's the deck of that they think about it that that it's a thing that\nThe child was a prison during the Nineteen sixties and seventies where hundreds of women were held because they went against the dictatorship that are fighting for democracy prominent when that film at president Dilma Rousseff wearing prison\nThey will also university students\nSociologist historian doctors and they ended up that either because they believed in the um struggled simply because they were handing out leaflets against the dictatorship university\nThe women who arrived in this prison after they'd been held a miniature detention but they've been to chit at least in the Taliban families knew where they were and they can visit to women\nHe might be you know and that would be a very very unfortunate thing to happen\nYou know one one a light into a ... at the end of the tone that I just saw today that they he's going to see requested during a he's the see him to uh put together the dad because I'm a minister and um and they environment ministry which um from what I Know it doesn't work in anywhere any part of the world\nSo um there are a lot of moderate people working for ... campaign there quietly working for him\nUh they're not debating they're not into social media um but they are working for him and my hope is that\nIf he's really a committed to creating jobs over the future to foster a tourism in in in Brazil especially ... tourism that he he there will be an economic incentive\nTo protect 'em a man in Brazil and um and and I do hope that to happen\nWhen they went out on top of the time I'm going to move on if if Brazil chooses shy of Olson are easy it's embracing some kind of strong arm rule that at face it has become popular in many parts of the wild\nOr is this a more profound change that will change the nature of Brazilian democracy a moderate talks to\nI think Brazil as a recession\nThe corruption investigations have really back to its institutions and for years for decades Brazil\nPoliticians have been modeling alone muddling through each crisis each scandal and now I think finally if somebody steps forward and does this in\nA way that respects the rule of law and shakes up in a way the system yes we could see something like that however\nI really have no ... cautions lots of concerns about it the situation and the most important let's say sign for us to look for is how do the people\nAccept it all things going to be calm when he takes office in early January who are we going to have riots is escalating the violence that moved temp came to bring them in a tree onto the streets I think that's the way we will see if we're going to go faster or slower or just actually have a chance for reform gig us\nGot any given everything that Brazil's going through is the new or if the strong man simply too powerful the old policy to succeed\nNo actually the opinion polls had showed that this has changed over the last week between October ... start\nThis week or so has lost or at a two percent of the voters she's rejection increase by five percent are going from ... to ... percent with similar to dodge if that trend keeps going on Sunday we could see a very similar to what happened\nIn the last election when Dilma Rousseff was running against a national editors Monica who is not lost ...\nYeah I Know I I mean we now ... and ah we ah we don't know who's gonna win elections there is a promote high promote viewed of both of NATO but we just you know we can't uh\nNobody can celebrate in the elections are happy with a a car I'm I'm I'm if people are concerned I think there is a lot of reason to be concerned about both on our own government and in fact a democracy but I'm equally concerned if not more\nWe don't we in from the uh died um and they are the ones in their own program who say about changing the ah the makeup of the uh superior uh um the courts\nAnd and changing the constitution pardon shit that's not true that is not even at that age I thank God they according to the wider okay you'll worrying about they determine that probably ... watch and they weren't clear and transparent towards that okay I just read it\nSays you have also led to UC Brazil's the chat embracing a strongman or if it's just as a temporary change for now is there more profound change at at ...\nWell that remains to be seen my take is that in a in a symbolic way Brazil is shorter back in the strong man route but in real life uh to run the country is not a one man show Brazil is the federal\nThan a has a multi party system has Congress with a veto powers has a strong judicial power so if ... tries to test the waters let's put it that way I think she want go very far\nAnd you think about that ...
