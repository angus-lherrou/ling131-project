border and about fifty people were apparently able to knock down a Guatemalan border fence to find both Mexican authorities calls for orderly migration and US President Donald Trump's threats of retaliation\nThe difference back then when Bill Owens pushed it and voters proved was the money was actually coming out of the budget with fixture damn Roach prop one oh nine that money is coming from the surplus money that's coming in people might not realize and they will at the end of year when they do their taxes\nThat the Trump tax code actually means of tax increase for most people's state income tax\nAnd in fact will be bringing in almost nine hundred million dollars more a year according to the state government and you think that should be tapped for roads I've had some of it should be where you see how much we starve roads over the last Twenty years we need to re priority when when\nI look at both prop one oh nine in one ten another difference I see is just the amount of money that would be generated a what do you say John Caldera to those who complained that that one oh nine is just a drop in the bucket\nIt's not a drop in the bucket it is a serious amount of money to jumpstart\nThe most critical projects they'd be really clear on concede this is not a silver bullet or nor is it a a unicorn bullets are like twenty or one ten unicorn bullet I always have never heard of that actually remember I was gonna say Christmas tree was\nIt is a doable amount my sense is that people are not ready for a statewide tax increase they're usually not they usually go down very strongly so what is it that we can get done an immediately and that's where one oh nine is\nAll right and on one ten Kelly rough to this idea of the sales tax increase you are hearing from mayor is like the mayor in Colorado Springs he says listen we've already passed some local taxes to address our own local transportation needs\nAlong come to the states perhaps with its own tax increase and the burden is just going up to high end our specific community would you address that concern for us\nYeah you have two huge issues first rural Colorado local communities there are not going to be able to on their own solve their transportation needs and why would we in the metro area care about that is because we have a workforce who cares about getting around the state it's part of the quality of life we sell here\nAnd if you're going to fix the system you have to fix it not city by city and hope everybody comes up with their contribution but you have to fix both the state system\nAnd the local system do you have any concerns that the tax rate is getting too high and some Colorado communities so our tax rate when you combine those state and local is still very competitive or in the country\nUm and so we don't have concerns about at our greater concern is our failure to invest\nIs impacting us greatly a study was done Ryan that shows each of us today is paint over two thousand dollars a year in use using more gas because we're sitting in traffic damage to our vehicles because of the condition of our roads more accidents\nTwo thousand dollars a year you talked about impacting working families this small increase in sales tax will help reduce that cost junk out there are there's\nNursing personally so that at a Twenty one percent jump in our state sales tax a small amount it is a serious investments\nI I I haven't done the math on the fly is that right twenty now and that's\nJust wrong what you're paying sales tax this'll be roughly about seven or eight percent what you're paying sales tax\nTotal heart current sales tax is two point five percent on the state level besides another point six to that as an increase of Twenty one percent\nIn any way you cut it it means that places like Boulder and long gone superior will be paying nine percent\nOf the same thing down in Colorado Springs which is why mayor is like the one in Jamestown and all over say wait a second this could hurt our ability\nLocally if we want to raise more taxes were local mobility local projects for seniors\nLocal safety projects and by the way let me I I Want to consider a couple of things we both agree not enough money is going into into transferred yes that's right and I also agree or something that Kelly said often is that there's a problem with our way we tax what we do right now we do mostly on the gas tax\nAnd uh as our cars become more efficient that means we're not getting as much back where you know\nMany years since the gas tax increase [noise]\nLet me just say that you're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan water and as part of our mid term election coverage we are debating a politely discussing\nPropositions one oh nine and one ten on your ballot they both have to do with transportation they take different approaches and junk how they're all note that one oh nine fixer damn roads\nDoes not make any funds available for alternative transportation that's a key difference here why why\nWell when you take a look at how much the state has been putting into trends that it's not as though a transit systems are starving for money or last year or two these appropriation was about to point two billion dollars and they carry only a fraction of our country it's about three or four percent\nWhereas she got a whopping one point four billion in other words ... almost half in other words we're spending a lot of money on transit as it is our roads are in trouble\nAnd we need right a crisis and we need to start investing in these problems otherwise we're going to have safety issues and people could lose their lives if we don't make roads safer in a realistic way\nOK you are basing fix our damn roads in part on the economic bounty that Colorado is experiencing I Want to play the view of the current governor [noise] uh this is John Hickenlooper I asked him about prop one oh nine\nFix our down roads would want to bond bitchy borrow three point five billion dollars and the state would have to pay that back every year with no new resources and I think that's crazy that the people proposing this are not willing to say where they're going to make these cuts how many people going to lose healthcare coverage how much are we going to pull back from our education funding\nAll right so as he tells it other things will suffer if one oh nine goes forward addressed that\nI've seen these scare tactics before but we've done this before with a T rex plan and in fact with the help of the Denver chamber back when we didn't have these massive surpluses pouring into the state I understand there isn't that sort of bell\nWeather or or good weather prediction like what happens if you know because\nThere there is a structural change the federal tax law which means of federal or a change to our tax taxes as well\nYou think the Trump tax cuts uh lend a certain stability\nTo the well what happens is the line item you take from your federal form to do your state income taxes that goes up dramatically if we wanted it to be revenue neutral we'd have to lower the taxes but let me just say this other governors like Bill Owens partnered with the Denver chamber of commerce Twenty years ago to do something when we had even less money\nSo to say that even if times were awful\nThat we could not re prioritize less than one percent of our spending towards roads\nI don't know any household that couldn't re prioritize one percent of their budget\nOf course tax policy doesn't necessarily say the same that could change too if an administrator shall\nWe have some interest in revenue and just went up if we wanted to we could pay this off in three years with the amount of surplus as we have so we have lots of choices\nSay Kelly the governor Hickenlooper does back prop one tenth the tax increase but you're not getting rousing support from either of the two candidates running to replace him the major party candidates so Republican Walker Stapleton sides with junk Caldera in favor of the bond issue with out a tax increase and Democrat Jared polish isn't too hot\nThe idea of a sales tax increase to to pay for this what\nDo I say to that yeah yeah the question is in Florida [laughter] so I think what we you know when you look at our coalition what you're going to see is a huge diverse coalition many of whom normally don't support tax increases\nAnd the chamber is not a huge fan of tax increases until you do the math and you realize the only way we're going to dress and improve our transportation system so our lives are better is if we funded and one of the reason we like sales tax is the first Ninety two million dollars that's raised is paid by tourists people who visit our state\nAnd so that was one of the reasons the coalition supports a sales tax is the strategy\nSo I saw the results of a recent poll and I think it was actually partly funded by the independence Institute and fix our damn roads but it does show\nThat people lean a towards one oh nine fix our damn roads of those who are decided there are many undecided we should say on this topic\nCan we talk through just briefly like I'm ... ... voter confusion or perhaps even voter generosity like the idea that one of these might pass both of these might pass neither of these might pass a I mean in many ways of doing measures here ...\nI think it's more likely that neither would pass than both would pass it both were passing terrific we've got lots of funding for a lot of things I have a feeling one or the other will pass and giving a history of tax increases state wide and polling not only from I'm not away from\nThat we've done but also polling that groups like the ... done with parents group we have seen that this was not a very popular proposal but we'll find out on election day and we can vote either way I'll give you the last word\nCan we ... we have done a lot of pulling in research or our initiative ... ten is built around what voters value local control money coming into their communities and identified list of priorities Twenty years it goes away the biggest projects that improve their quality of life and voters have consistently told us they like this and support it\nThanks for being with us both of you thank you Kelly rough president of the Denver metro chamber of commerce she heads the coalition in favor of prop one ten to raise the state's sales tax for transportation John Caldera heads the libertarian independence Institute\nHe supports proposition one oh nine otherwise known as fix our damn roads it would raise three and a half billion dollars in bonds and repay them with existing state funds\nIt's Colorado matters\nFrom CPR News I'm Ryan mortar they often look like bird houses but they're filled with books there are more than five hundred little free libraries in neighborhoods throughout Denver alone\nThe idea for them came from Todd bowl who passed away Thursday at the age of sixty two he had pancreatic cancer let's listen back to my conversation with both from last year he was in Denver to declare it a city of distinction welcome to the program hello thank you very much how did the idea\nLittle free libraries come to you it ... it was just a a when my mother passed you know I I couldn't I couldn't pray enough when she was dying and couldn't cry enough can scream enough and so\nAt her funeral I gave away a little necklace that said ... dancing spirit Nineteen twenty seventh through\nAnd it was based on an old Sioux Indian saying that nobody really ever passes into all they've touched are gone and so what it was it was a dance of my mother to the community so I put up this a little schoolhouse one room schoolhouse that a\nA kind of mimic to where she taught as a as a teacher that she was a teacher yeah and then I put in books that she'd that you'd had over the years that she passed back and forth with family and I felt it was kind of a gift to the community to celebrate that spirit of who my mother was\n... so in some ways do you see each little free library as\nA version of your mother continuing dancing dancing absolutely um ice each the library's like one of my kids and I see each one of them is a dance of my mother around the planet\nYou call people who put up little free libraries stewards and are there more than five hundred of them in metro Denver I guess making it one of the most active regions in the\nCountry absolutely Denver has been absolutely wonderful ah they embrace it as art they've in braces community\nThey've been raised to as a ways of giving back to the community social justice they've done all kinds of things and I've watched him for years\nAnd we've been absolutely impressed what happens and we know that five hundred you have today in a couple of years will be a thousand so we we feel that it's becoming a part of the fabric of Denver and that is really exciting to us a thought\nCrossed my mind is I was walking through the neighborhood that the people who live there likely had no problem accessing books you know there's the public library\nOr where I was walking they were probably well heeled enough to buy a book if they needed one like what what role do these play what do you see is the the mission of little free libraries\nWill uh I Believe one that everybody has a right to read and then everybody should read and and our long term goals and twenty thirty five that we write a book that's in titled we all read weld together the history of the grassroots literacy movement\nAnd what we do is write a chapter every year in Denver is a big part of that chapter in the idea is that we don't have enough resources really to you know make the difference we need to make totally so neighborhoods step up and help educate and help with literacy of their own community\nAnd do you find that these little free libraries appear in all kinds of neighborhoods are in more upper middle class ones like what what do you know as you look at\nTheir distribution I'm living free libraries about eighty five percent women women mothers are the key drivers of little free library\nAnd what happens is they listen to it on a public radio station like this or read it in the newspaper in upper class higher social economic neighborhoods start and then what happens is it starts to work its way through the community starts in ending up at the apartment trailer on you know the schools\nAnd so what happens is starts out more social economic higher levels ... and then it works its way throughout the community to all levels than you've seen that in communities around the world I guess Detroit Cleveland Minneapolis St Paul Los Angeles\nEl Paso Phoenix New Orleans on and on is it data driven like are you looking at ways in which data can tell you about where they are and where they need to be well we have a world map and the world map is somebody uh signs up with us gets a sign that are specific number\nAnd they go up in the world map and when we know are they are and then you can look at the world map anywhere you are going or traveling and go visit a little free library\nWe know that they need to be really everywhere and we find out at higher social economic neighborhoods is more about building community and connecting community and the lower social economic neighborhoods us more about literacy in\nBuilding the reading um I opened one little free library and there is quite the hodgepodge a biography of the late jazz singer Betty Carter and adventurers guide to Hawaii there was a children's picture book do these though in some way become our final resting place for books that people want to get\nRid of what happens is people often and their book lovers in book lovers tell us all the time that books are my heart and soul they define my humanity to find who am I Can't live without books and they tell us all the time this is a natural extension of who they are\nInstead of the little free library becomes really a part of them be start out by doing just what you said as arresting ground for the something they want to get rid of yeah and it turns into the most intimate experience in the community because what happens\nIs you're sharing of your heart and who you are and what happens is people start sharing their best and most important books to reflect themselves to the community\nAnd for those unfamiliar with what these look like um they they are kind of school has like or bird house like that really everyone who Iraq's one does it a little differently but as soon as the wacky or designs you've seen oil\nEverything from rocket ships to you know we see things that are out of old ... old microwaves we see I'm On my own microwaves old fridge raiders of computers you know people turn almost anything they can imagine into a little free library\nWhat is your favorite story about someone encountering a little free library will probably my favorite story was a I got approached by a ... the former governor Jim Doyle of Wisconsin you kept me on the shoulders he's where you're from right right yes godson\nAnd he said you know tied you said I have to tell you my wife and I love little free libraries and he said and I want to tell you what's going on in America I said that's not who we are right now he says this is not we as Americans we're not this device if\nWe're not this polarized you said little free libraries is more about who we are he said we reach across the aisle we reach across the street we pick each other up we help each other we don't care where they're from we want to make their life better he said ... little free libraries more\nReflection of what Americans really hard and so uh that touched me deeply in one more is that a man came up to me and he said after presentation little free libraries understand them it's like air conditioning and they said well you know what do you mean to ... so yeah and he said well when he was a kid he's sixty something\nHe or the parents and his grandparents read on the\nDeck earn their porch they played in the streets with the kids in the sidewalks and you know the fields and then they got air conditioning they went in the house just shut the windows they shut the doors they turned on the TV and he said and it was all downhill from then in the digital divide began\nAnd he said but it's been over fifty years and with little free library we're talking again\nThey're they're connecting again with the neighborhood around them it does strike me as kind of beautifully analog you know little free libraries in the digital world\nAnd it's outside for that matter are you a steward that you have a little free librarian in front of your home town of several I have is the first one you know he was the first one yet [laughter] that that would instill standing\nYeah it's still standing and I also have the thousands one that I put to make that is on her and my dad when he passed in in that one I have a music box you open it up and plays to dream the impossible dream which is kinda cool you're very poetic\nI think we're all passionate at heart and I think that all of us have that a passion inside that we just want to come out\nAnd one of the things about them and free library just dance of the community and you find out how many people are really caring and really caring about their neighbors\nTodd Bowles speaking with us last year as the designated Denver a city of distinction for having more than five hundred little free libraries both died Thursday at age sixty two from complications due to the pancreatic cancer\nColorado matters from CPR news\n\nIf you like your fall weekend sunny and warm get ready

devoted Kerry and John Kerry is just break out in practice probably [laughter]\n\nSo\nThat some of the ... of a campaign is who are protesting against police brutality Priya how would you define that place than in the spectrum\nIt's very clear they're saying exactly the opposite of what a tree and just sat there saying we are being treated differently we'll being singled out by the police and it is only when black lives matter\nCan we say that all lives matter so it's actually saying we want to be not\nSingled out we want to not be treated as different\nAnd you know and Martin Luther king that's very sanitized kind of white ... should have Martin Luther king that floats around\nMartin Luther king didn't just say well we all want to be Americans why can't we all the American he was not a he was not been all in that way he understood that certain groups were excluded from what was pretending to be a universal ideal and he was saying that in order to achieve\nEquality of citizenship African Americans hatched a such that rights to civil right yeah I\nMean I literally ... you're the one who making he's making a slightly of simplified binary because you either describing a position which a race doesn't matter at all and we're just against injustice and be abstract and we don't recognize his ... ways in which obviously has been instantly as racial injustice\nUm oh everything needs to become about identity and we sort of lose out of science ... society where met us led I think it's I don't think ... between how Martin Luther king and Broadway bronco bomb it talked about those things\nAnd how some people in the space of identity politics I'll talk about it is it they said\nWhy should we care for example when African Americans are being discriminated against and how do we argue about that the majority population and one of the ancestors you claim to care about universal principles you claim to care\nAbout the principles in the constitution and when you look at the American south right now you see these principles are being violated so you as an American have a reason to struggle against injustice Adrian time beyond we have some common as Americans and that is the right way I think ... ...\nBy off for an ad on failed like entity\nPolitics that I was given black lives matter and I showed it to you from the accepts that we just listened to that black lives matter will not say we are different\nI drew pass wild but the point is you have to build bridges between differences so that people can build a common life and have a meaningful democracy and then the economy that is actually open tools to the point about identity politics at its base clues of what is the sense of belonging that everyone can shatter news to redo the thing\nYou can I throw in a a different element or if this is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now\nFrom say a civil rights movement to the sixties city that many more people have access to these ideas have access to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that ... with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is on American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that\nBut I'm saying it's a function of people being welfare having more access to to having a voice because they can access the media because they can have social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't ...\nYourself as a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character of the conversation that's being had on line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a\nTendency toward predation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more woke\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth to white identity politics\nIt the ... that actually is\nDestructive if there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf that Richard fending off it is one that has been set up by the majority [noise] this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nSet protests them all in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim\nNarratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the ... what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege being coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your loss of ... outrageous\nThough is that rather than putting pointed and how does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technical aspect can lead spinning abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of my knowledge the majority of responses to dodge and nothing none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression mixed protection\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice that affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always a painting to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be X Y or Z that\nThat doesn't ... if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have simply not recognized but that's exactly in fact walk\nThe beauty movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white American goal and sort of dramatic life story and a half north part is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which the movie which tells the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden the invented made the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible left but some of food that was problematic exercise leaving me is the crux of disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between\nCultures rather than we would have to stay in the lane and devoid cultural ... on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like the kind of cheesy\nA wrong call them I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all things from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we coached on politics until kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleventh for you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nWell I think the um Trump phenomenon in the United states are definitely does some of its rise to a identity politics and it it in a reaction against it the shrill note that I observed earlier is alienating to the majority and if\nI saw the statistics recently I Wish I could quote them but the proportion of white Americans who believe that they are the primary victims of\nDiscrimination in the United states is shockingly high and of course I look at that and I say well that's ridiculous but it's you know that's what they feel and it's partly the result of of fifty years of affirmative action so you know they feel discriminated against\nAnd um they look at what is often a a certain amount of casual racism against white people in the identity politics conversation\nAnd think that will you know someone has to stick up for us and you know I wouldn't simplified the Trump phenomena as only coming from this small campus movement but it hasn't helped\nAnd this way of of talking about people and prioritizing issues has definitely infected the Democratic party and is also alienating middle of the road and independent voters who might otherwise be on board\nPre I Wonder how you view this this changing of the political landscape\nYeah well that's the kind of the things to say I'm really struck by the way in which he does in fact a sudden form of white identity politics um that Brooks Trump to power everyone else's child should identity politics and not the majority of the majority is playing\nA is being made to play a role that identity politics what I find interesting is the ways in which although we talk all the time about how facts math and help the truth matters and how fake news has a problem\nSuddenly feeling the hurt feelings of the majority become the basis on which entire country is run their elections I mean what else feelings if I feel\nThat there are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the stats affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people nowhere near proportional into academia for instance I feel\nAffirmative action is upsetting but it just that have any bearing with reality are we discussing reality when all the facts what is the truth\nWell on the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really said it's just as silly as river sexism the point is that racism and sexism are about ...\nOkay so you can't really punch up well you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people don't suffer structurally\nNational races so a few points you're supposed to Fort unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and a democracy is you have to carry somewhat about the feelings of the majority because otherwise the booth with people like Donald Trump and but as it does offer for everybody you specially for most vulnerable so what I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections\nAround ideals that are going to help us come together society and help us fight discrimination rather than ... and so the reason to care about the feelings of people is that in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a political\nAdvisor to let the facts we can't we can't and ... and the name all feel\nA little hard and Frank I'm Talking about in the country was the other thing is that I I Do find it\nQuite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think it's up to ...\n... did you find a counter that we have different kinds of hard to know what I Would say that well actually I don't know how to proceed I was in my mouth I mean I didn't finish are bringing about a Trump precisely shows what's the problem is with conception of politics but says we're going to fight for our group and for our side and\nWe don't care about anything else Priya\nSo we should have affirmative action because that upsets white beef also the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised groups fair access to write in order that the majority and not be hurt himself\nI but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including the vast majority of people of color in the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on ... I Want to move away from\nThat point and bring you in a tree and we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the establish policies\nActually has no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should you not like the\nI mean it's a big ah issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites do you stop as you mentioned the on representative that often very smoothly\nAnd yes often watch groups but then as I said ... groups which actually bend bring about the system is unjust almost a father why people and many more so it's not the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot ... wide working class populations in seven countries I've simply not being the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all the kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last forty years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that place um I find that the W. W. see either white working class is a very interesting construct\nOne can come off as as a whole have not done while I'm working to offer as as a whole on not white that they could white people but they're all working classes were being at the shop end of ... near liberalism of capitalism\nIf pressed their ... because they're working class not because they're white there was no evidence to tell us that the white looking to us it was out doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black working class which\nIs an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in the valley area what happened that as a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see if you which is dominated politics\nIn that part of Germany for decades found itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of it the biggest policy but a much smaller that policy than it had been\nHemorrhage face the greens on one side and the anti immigrant asked the on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which is enough to send to ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have clear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm a lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into\nWhat I think now because the mainstream parties offering something that's inclusive and off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply washing lots of other components of the of the Washington has suffered in often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much less the mass of all there's not a smoker and I said I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow\nWe can just say we're able to look at the most depressed people are the only ones that my son in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the wise approach an emotional rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe are people who are involved each we're people embedded in relationships institution the nuts and feeding do methane is angel longing and we're going to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage from that has been loaning so who onto wet and he's part of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland uh after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation and northern Irish politics\nBut this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tried then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully and advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable in some ways it was if you'll never end\nThe remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India\nIt winds bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity\nThe pasta older needs new classes or new groups come on the block and simply want to claim that hierarchy for themselves broadly what we should have is a ... actually works around you know roles\nTalents vacations and actually give everyone a sense of dignity which hasn't been and Priya would have recognition\nMarkings held their shares kind of a liberal fundamentalism that we always have higher all can what matters is what kind of hierarchy we have\nI you know I'm all for the human imagination and the human imagination has many times through history and in many places and they shouldn't ... without hierarchy what people are in fact able to be at once individual\nAnd part of the collective good so I actually don't buy a we we talked about you know the extreme left in the extreme\nRight we need to talk about the extreme sent to an extreme liberalism as well you know these are the banal ideas about hierarchy and tribalism and this is the way that human beings are and always will be I don't think that is the case I think human beings have both I\nThink the imagination involves second political imaginations change no\nReal idea what that meant but um no I Know a kitty I'm ... I Want to go back to what kind of society we should envisage and an imagine um and the question you asked about whether it'll ever be possible to get away from your identity entirely\nA I'm a liberal democracy which means but I'm for society where people have a great amount of freedom in fashioning on life and that means that some people will do you identify with groups of from and say\nI was born a religious Muslim and I want to be able to not just not be white but where for example the head scarf and be accepted as a full member of the society and treated a with equal dignity and respect\nBut very much live within my comment um sense of my life around ... percent of my life around those kinds of things at the same time oh it's a thing I Want to live in a society in which the same person can grow up\nAnd make the choice about where to come from the time to come from the skin color religion is not an old important to them and they don't want that to play a very large role in life at all and at the moment I think the vision that society which has his double freedom is ... it's ...\nFrom the radical right it's ... some people are like Donald Trump who want to discriminate you don't want to recognize people have different skin causing them to these as equal but it's also affecting from people who say\nEverything his identity everything's going to be your top national belonging and there's no getting away from that Asian is that how you use it a a a democracy that threaten from the radical right on the radical left\nAlmost certainly events also threatened by that kind of a high liberalism that says that we're just all ruthless isolates individuals with nothing in common with anyone else so we we want to I think generally eliminate all those extremes and get back to a conversation about belonging about the things that we haven't come and his workers\nAs men and women and people of other you know orientation\nAs people leaving the same places as citizens I think it's that conversation about blowing up masters rather than you know keep on emphasizing all the differences and saying that somehow\nWe can imagine some sort of utopia without no distinctions or or or you know differences in in in roles what's so I thought I'm according for liberal extremism whatsoever that itself is about an hour remark when I'm quoting poison society that recognizes people for the different roles and talents implications\nEnded affords public you know dignity to everyone and dignity means being respected for all sorts of roles you've played for the relationships you have not being forced into warm identity or into just being a inoculation vigil\n... very briefly ... is that the world you're championing a hyper liberal one where everybody that goes back into that separate guidance is\nHardly I don't think anything that sets today has um attended in that direction and in fact I've I've no idea who these mythical people are hoping claiming this I think what we need to be looking at quite simply it's who has wealth and power and who is in fact inflicting suffering and\nExploitation on other people and focus on that an Oscar ... real questions instead of having a false debate about how people who want to be able to use women's boxing is let's say are uh you know a responsible for the rights of racism I think it's just a\nReally kind of a surreal discussion that we have sometimes at the expense of looking at actuality it's not no Shriver\nWell as a novelist and a person um I get concerned that the identity politics in much like that just that last comment is now tracking us into a world where we think all that matters is human hierarchy that that's the only conversation we ever have\nIdentity politics as being very concerned of course with\nWho's privileged who's on top who's been more disadvantaged you know life and the world are bigger than that and I don't want to live in that in that space I Want to be able to talk about architecture\n[noise] I don't that sold that's it for this week on the real story Lionel Shriver\n...
