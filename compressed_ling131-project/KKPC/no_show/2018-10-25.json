congressional district and his strategy is one Democrats nationwide have embraced in fact more than half of pro democratic TV ads in the home stretch to election day have mentioned health care compared to around one third of Republican ads that's according to the Wesleyan Media project\nMargie Omero is a democratic pollster\nDemocrats have a very clear advantage on health care and not only that it's one of the top issues of voter saying not heard of that that they think is a big issue is facing them personally and facing the country\nThat is a big change from the twenty ten and twenty fourteen midterms when Republican slammed Obamacare Democrats barely touched the topic\nBut since twenty sixteen Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare\nAnd the law has gained popularity now Republicans have ramped up their own messaging among the new ads that popped up in recent weeks one from Republican John ... whom Delgado is trying to unseat the ad features fast those wife a cancer survivor\nJohn them firsthand how important health care's her family\nThe children to guarantee cameras for people with preexisting condition this is one of\nA recent crop of ads were GOP candidates promised to protect people with preexisting conditions President Trump has been saying the same thing but then the Republican Obamacare repeal bill would likely have made it harder for many sick people to get coverage that's according to the Kaiser Family foundation Larry Levitt\nInsurers would have still have the guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions but for people who are uninsured and had a pre existing condition that might have food prohibitively high premiums which would have put coverage of the way out of reach\nAccording to a September pull from Kaiser even a majority of Republicans supported keeping these protections however let it points out a flipside to the policy\nWhen you see a a guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions premiums to go up especially for people who are healthy\nAnd this has long been part of the Republican argument that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people and furthermore force people to get insurance they didn't want however there aren't dozens of Republican ads explaining for example the finer points of pre existing conditions and there's a good reason for that\nThere's a

kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been

statement one way or another we have in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nSeveral us auto companies including

went missing it's been five days since ... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince\nOr said whether he believes NBS as he's referred she played a role\nWhen Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi king in his policies and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator tot young he has called the crown prince impulsive and reckless and says the U.S should spend the Saudi leader a message senator young welcome\nThanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S incentives Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say uh over the last couple of years of the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi air a parent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust in Solomon's pledge to reform its country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from\nA but we do have leverage or as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians through airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years\nIn Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like Indiana State a graduate or ... in Washington Post journalist\nSo these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlights but we need to begin holding\nThe government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on honing Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress have been calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the conference to be replaced you agree that that would be a good step\nWill look we're still confirming certain details with respect to ah this most recent tragedy in the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals' we already know had been involved\nIn this ... situation I'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out uh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more\nAnd we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in this sort of atrocities I just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms ... arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\n[noise] look I think that the number of jobs are the ... be lead the loss from this ah or frankly fairly minor and I I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead as a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here\nThe country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action that\nCountry happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous al ... affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the presidents do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh jeez death\nWell I think uh the president's message as these gather more information or it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death as the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump has been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of the United states\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing\nThat the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners uh they provide as valuable intelligence but I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined is the Saudis\nAh Deceive Us and as they engage in a violation of our fundamental values as they strongly appear to have done a in this instance and that could show ...\nRepublican senator tied at young at Indiana thank you very much for joining us thanks so much also [noise]\n\nWas another tough day for the stock market all the

has access to information and data that I don't have we do large scale studies\nAnd our studies don't agree with all the things that Mr Troyer said uh I Know we've got a report coming out in a few weeks that's where we really have to sit down and say here's where his statistics come here's where our statistics come from the differences to scale there still black market problem and I think\nWhy get divided in and fight over who's the bigger larger let's all unite and go after it\nI'll just say that Troy yours on his way out the new U.S attorney Jason Dunn was confirmed by the Senate earlier this month is there a change she would make the Colorado hasn't made all ready to address the black market or do you think it's a matter of time with the current resource\nSo so we've increased enforcement resources significant\nLast couple of years are we lowered the plant counts the number of plots used to be able to grow Ninety nine planets well that was an invitation to a black market and that was something that\nUh what happened before my time but we probably should have gotten to it sooner 'cause this was a medical\nUse yeah but again that was became a a pipeline I think for a lot of the illegal activity we lower taxes on recreational marijuana for the specific reason to try and drive the black market make it less worth the risk\nTo get into the black market and and there's more we can do a big part of it's just putting more resources towards helping local law enforcement officials\nGo after this black market and some of the places it's interesting a number of bust where they had outdoor grows out of large scale hundreds thousands of marijuana plants\nI think we have the ability at very low cost to get digital satellite information a high accuracy a visual information where I Can't imagine if you got a couple of acres of marijuana plants\nThat's got to look different from the photograph the pine trees so let's take some of that information and go after it and find if there are these large grows which several people said well they're probably we've we busted three of them they are probably many of them let's go find them to\nClimate change now and a recent report by a highly respected international group that says the pace of change and the impacts are going to be even worse than scientists had previously predicted\nIn June you issued an executive order requiring Colorado to adopt what are called low emission vehicles standards really following the example of California which is already adopted those rules\nThe Trump Administration on the other hand has said it will roll back standards for more fuel efficient vehicles and apprehended California from setting its own stricter rules a wide bucked the federal government on\nThis [laughter] you know the federal government we worked so hard to get our methane regulations in Colorado where the only state this was in connection with oil and gas right is is reducing fugitive emissions from all the oil fields now cameras rolling those out and yes President Trump and his administration\nThose almost identical rules were being used for all the be all end land in the United states they're rolling back so that strike one then you go to strike too in terms of coal emissions and\nThe emissions from coal from burning coal or not just the CEO to and the other climate change gases salsa particularly if you've got a child or anybody who's deals with asthma\nThan fighting for more coal especially when it costs more to burn it now that strike too and then I look at the the low emissions vehicles I Know that's probably the largest scale\nThat strike three why wants to Detroit and I've talked to senior executives at several of the largest motor company's American motor American motives and wanted to import and said oh you guys pushing for this is this something you'll you negotiate so long you got all your manufacturing lines of production in place\nAnd they said we are not pushing for this this is\nComing out of Washington this is a politically driven initiative so that strike three my question is why what does the\nTrump Administration and the Republican Party have against clean air and looking at climate change is you're going to be some accountability for the people that are going out and spending millions and millions of dollars to deny the climate changes even happening if the scientists are right and\nThe study last that you're referring to like the C. C. D. I. D. C. C. they echoed untouched on again a lot of the permafrost and I was unaware of how much methane is locked up frozen permafrost\nAnd and now is that begins to thaw that methane causes more climate change sixty times more than CEO to\nWe're putting that into the air at a rate was on fond of even ten or Fifteen Years ago what happens when these feedback loops get to the point where suddenly the\nCost to cities along the oceans as the ocean becomes more certified which is happening we can measure that that's clearly a result of climate change what accountability is they're going to be if the people that are actually making a profit they're doing this for their own self interest and yet they're putting\nYou know the rest of America at risk\nI Want to wrap up on the election so your administrator since coming to an end and there's the race to replace the Democratic candidate is Jared polish and he has loaned his campaign more than twenty two million dollars of his personal money [noise] you've had this job for eight years is it worth twenty two million\nDollars [laughter] you know\nI'm an al say something about our policy is very interesting isn't necessarily good at the heart of my question yeah well well okay I I think that uh most people when they get to running for governor or us center a but they have an ambition that's kind of always been there as it's often ego driven\nAnd and I think I'm an exception to that rule in in in that sense I can see it in others\nOr at least I Believe I can and I look at ... he's not in at driven to be the macho big shot or the uh the center of attention\nHe has and and I've talked to two old friends of his from when he was a child that even when he was a little kid he was the one who always helped the other kid he was the other kids getting Bush he stood up for the other kid he's just since his earliest childhood he's been someone who wants to help others and do good and he has\nYou know he's put in a situation where he made a great deal of money while he was still in college but very very rare and he's decided to use that to try and make the world a better place at the\nPoint is that Walker Stapleton has his own ideals the Republican candidate for governor and his own reasons for running which may be beyond himself but he doesn't have twenty two million so your idea that's fair enough fair and I didn't ask your question is it worth it was what you first asked short ... two part question before we go is it worth at one end to is it fair that\nMen of ideals might be on such an even playing field\nSo it is a I think it is worth it if you're someone or like charcoal is really wants to do good and put service above getting other benefits of life I think he puts sort of it's very very hot now is it fair that he has more money this is America and and we have\nGone back and forth I mean at this point according to our Supreme Court\nCorporations are people but certainly individuals who have succeeded and accumulated great wealth\nAre protected and allowed free speech so he has that right now there is a a initiative on the ballot this year there was actually going to address the fairness of this and say I if somebody puts a million dollars into their own campaign\nLimits for the rest of the candidates would increase as a result I by John type five ... has actually said he's supportive of this

three decades it would reverse almost Thirty years of touch in education funding\nSince the recession state lawmakers have withheld seven point four billion dollars from Colorado schools to shore up other parts of the state budget the hemorrhage of cash has left many districts operating at two thousand eight funding levels Kennedy says amendments Seventy three would stop the bleeding\nHalf of the school districts in Colorado today have cut back to a four day school week that is unacceptable in a state with the top economy in the nation\nThe constitutional amendment would fund full day kindergarten for all children would target millions more to preschool education gifted students and students with disabilities local districts would decide where to spend the rest of the money Michael fields is with Colorado rising action a group that advocates conservative principles\nThis is a one point six billion dollar tax increase and really you have no guarantees about student outcome\nField

getting out of the education system and can be prioritize our budget\n\nMiddle school teacher Bridget Goodwin recently joined teachers to support amendments Seventy three\nI don't know financially and

more dollars a year\nBut if you make more than a million you'll pay an extra twenty four thousand in taxes Kerry Kennedy says it would rebalance the tax code that has middle income earners paying a higher percentage of their income on taxes so\nNinety two percent of the people here in Colorado would not pay a higher income tax under a man that Seventy three just the top eight percent\nFor Michael fields of Colorado rising action the income tax I think it would hurt the economy key and Luke rag one with the conservative education reform group ready Colorado I think it could hurt some small businesses that pull in more than five hundred thousand dollars in income when\nThose high net worth small businesses and individuals face those large taxes they go elsewhere there's some of the

are we going to do I was going to impact us I think those studies need to have them beforehand or supporters\nThe time is now to make the funding system bearer Kerry Kennedy says Colorado would remain competitive\nRight now we have the third lowest corporate income tax in the country and amendment Seventy three would bring us to the ninth lowest corporate income taxes in the country\nThere is another provision in the proposal that has to do with property taxes backers argue Seventy three ... property tax relief to farmers ranchers and homeowners by lowering and stabilizing the school portion of local property taxes\nOpponents worry that change may hurt cities counties and water and fire districts by putting downward pressure on the local taxes they rely on\nEducators say Colorado's schools are on the brink with rising inequality between school districts amendments Seventy three they say would level the playing field\nAnd journey ... joins us now Hogan journey hello Ryan your stories on school finance including a minute Seventy three prompted many questions from our audience and why don't we start with Barbara Brett\nShe heard your earlier interview with a recent high school grad who wanted to know if the teacher protests had any impact on increasing school funding and in that discussion you explained why Colorado schools keep asking for money so I think it's important to lay that out first before we go to Barbara specific question\nYeah insurance state lawmakers began withholding money from public schools during the recession to balance the budget school districts across the states they cut staff and programs and some of those haven't come back\nTo the cumulative debt or shortfall to Colorado schools is seven point four billion dollars this year alone it's an eight hundred and thirty million dollar shortfall that they get like an ... state ... schools money because the constitution requires a certain level of funding every year and last\nTook billions during the recession from schools to pay for other areas of the budget that we're strapped\nTo state lawmakers have not been able to pay that back\nI Know this winter they did make a hundred and fifty million dollar dent in the aisle you for the upcoming budget ear the schools have said we're at the breaking point we can't continue to operate like this we've got to go to voters and try to get back to the funding levels we had when the great recession started in two thousand eight\nSo in ... amendments Seventy three this attempt to raise one point six billion dollars in funds for schools and let's listen to what Barbara Brett ask you she said she can't understand what the relationship is between Seventy three in this I use the more than seven billion dollars taken out of schools\nIs just no money for the schools [noise] why don't we get the seven billion out of the states you know repay the system how to citizens now that it's going to go to public schools and not be used for roads and bridges like the apparently the seven billion with\nThe Barbara's question is an excellent one it made me do some research first it's more appropriate to talk about the yearly debts and not the whole seven billion but let's just take the eight hundred and thirty million dollar shortfall it's called the budget stabilization factor by the way it has been impossible to pay that back with existing state revenue\nWhat happened is when the economy is good revenue limits under Taber the taxpayer bill of rights kick in and taxpayers get a rebate instead of going to pay off the aisle you and basically the state does not have an extra eight hundred and thirty million to give schools\nOr some would argue that the political will to find a solution to this funding crisis it's not there\nOkay and back to amend at Seventy three make the connection to the debt [noise] yes\nAmendment backers would argue that the one point six billion dollars it would raise is is really a modest ask compared to the cumulative loss to schools over a decade\nAmendment Seventy three would eliminate the early debt owed to schools and they would begin to add revenue districts are also struggling because I I should say during this time lawmakers passed many requirements on schools for example\nA you've got to do these new strict teacher evaluations new academic standards but they gave virtually no extra funding to implement them\nSo districts would be paid back to some extent under amendment Seventy three\nYes supporters say the measure would give each and every district what is owed to them from that yearly I owe you\nPlus it makes some changes like making sure additional dollars go to districts that are serving students with high needs give us more specifics about what Seventy three would pay for yes or a few more details that weren't in the radio story that just ... the amendment specifies that the amount of per pupil funding would go up to Seventy three hundred dollars\nA certain groups of students would get funding booze special education gifted and talented students English language learners and some more money for pre school funding every kindergartner would get a have access to full day schooling and the rest will go to local districts many see their top priority is teacher salaries\nYou know instead of instead of trying to time I'm sort of in the point\nWhere you can meet a large amount of money based on your tuition would be better if you just look at your\nAt your long term target let's say that you know sixty percent of your total assets if

legacy will be the judges he appoints not just to the Supreme Court but to the lower courts as well\nLower court nominations don't get a lot of public attention they usually fly below the radar but they've long been governed by an elaborate series of Senate rules and traditions that are aimed at ensuring that presidents don't have carte blanche to pick nominees\nNow those traditions are being tossed aside at a rapid rate NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has this story\nPrior to the Trump Administration there was plenty of tit for tat in the escalating partisan war is over judicial nominations\nBut the tactics were aimed at blocking nominees since President Trump was sworn in however the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges in the process ignoring our tossing aside rules that have long existed to ensure that there is some consensus in picking judges\nGone for all practical purposes is the rules that prevented action on a judicial nominee who was not approved by his or her home state senator\nGone is the practice of not holding a confirmation hearing until the American bar association has completed its professional evaluation of the nominee\nGone is the general practice of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other Senate committee has been holding hearings during recess but for judicial nominees the Senate confirmation train keeps on running even though and likely because Senate Democrats are defending a near record number of seats in the election and have to be out on the house things\nIndeed just two Republican senators Orrin Hatch of Utah who's

political opponents of President Trump's now we should say the president's political careers in part defined by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with but Trump right now is calling for civility\nThat's right at a rally last night in Wisconsin Trump condemned this act and so far authorities haven't released any information about a possible suspect\nAre let's turn now to NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR's justice reporter Ryan Lucas to talk through all of this morning to you both learned more than I run I Want to start with you it seems like there were at least seven of these devices mailed out um who are these suspicious packages meant for\nWell the first was found Monday outside of New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered addressed to Hillary Clinton a former president ... bomber\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan now the package that was intended for Britain was actually sent it to see in an office in New York and discovered in the mail room there yesterday\nAnd then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five\nOf these two were addressed to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump so officials are\nAlready talking about these things as pipe bombs they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWell in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there's no word on a possible suspect uh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we know that they were sent in identical bubble raft manila envelopes\nOr they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz the Florida uh each package had six us a postal service stamps\nThe one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was ... return to sender the FBI says so in that case to the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages\nShe has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this\nAnd it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTen let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how is the president and reacting\nThe president has been reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has a condemned or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nI'm ... and in his rally speech last night\nAnd he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to\nTurn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he has done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so\nRally was at an airport ... aircraft hangar in ah in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and they had all the trappings of a usual Trump rally accept that then the president simply red from the teleprompter and ah he\nHe does this say what it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room of the White House um and he was um he was a self conscious about that I sort of calling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look I mean here's a clip\nBy the way\nYou see how nice of you know like I mean [noise] we're all very well [noise]\nI mean we can keep it that way right\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear are often he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump\nOr and and you just don't know when it's going to happen in the person doesn't say anything directly about the people who were targeted have any of them had anything yeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted\nOften they're features of his rally at a Hillary Clinton was speaking yesterday at\nAn event and she said that she is fine thanks to the secret service

refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood what reality was\nAnd another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public the allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interest political opportunism and the attorney general's

lot of public attention they usually fly below the radar but they've long been governed by an elaborate series of Senate rules and traditions that are aimed at ensuring that presidents don't have carte blanche to pick nominees now\nThose traditions are being tossed aside at a rapid rate NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story\nPrior to the Trump Administration there was plenty of tit for tat and the escalating partisan war is over judicial nominations\nBut the tactics were aimed at blocking nominees since President Trump was sworn in however the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges in the process ignoring our tossing aside rules that have long existed to ensure that there is some consensus in picking judges\nGone for all practical purposes is the rules that prevented action on a judicial nominee who was not approved by his or her home state senator\nGone as a practice of not holding a confirmation hearing until the American bar association has completed its professional evaluation of the nominee\nGone as the general practice of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other Senate committee has been holding hearings during the recess but for judicial nominees the Senate confirmation train keeps on running even though and likely because Senate Democrats are defending a near record number of seats in the election and have to be out on the house

Minutes and featured one controversial nominees talking for several minutes about his wife parents children even his cat\nI asked Senator Hatch who never agreed to such a recess hearing when he chaired the Judiciary Committee why Republicans went ahead this time\nWas I don't know a lot of conservatives that the you know we have to move move ahead and if they're not qualified and you just go ahead and move ahead and so far we haven't had a lot of cooperation\nGoing ahead has yielded important results for Republicans over the last year and a half\nThe GOP controlled Senate has confirmed twenty nine Trump nominees to federal appeals court\nCompared to confirmation of just two nominees in the last two years of the Obama presidency in all Trump has managed to win confirmation for an astonishing one sixth of the sitting active federal appeals court judges in the country\nThese courts decide cases involving a broad range of issues from Social Security or veterans' benefits claims to more high profile cases and they are from most people the court of last resort deciding some twenty seven thousand cases each year compared to fewer than a hundred decided by the Supreme

C. two new suspicious packages had been found this morning a law enforcement official says one was addressed to former vice president Joe Biden\nIt was found in Newcastle county Delaware and police in New York City are investigating a package that was addressed to the actor Robert De Niro who is a prominent critic of President Trump\nAnd this is all coming after seven apparent pipe bombs were sent to top Democrats all known political opponents of President Trump yesterday\nNPR's justice reporter and White House correspondent Tamara Keith are here with the latest when are you guys hello demoted are so right in the story is obviously still moving this morning what is the latest that we know about that packages that have come in today\nWell a a law enforcement official tells me that one was addressed to as you mentioned former vice president Joe Biden this was discovered in Newcastle county Delaware Biden of course is from Delaware I'm told that this package is similar to the others that have been found in recent days as being looked at in the light\nOf the second package was found this morning and New York's Tribeca neighborhood outside a business belonging to the uh actor Robert De Niro deniro of course has been a very publicly critical of President Trump\nOr the New York police department says this package contained a potential explosive devices similar to the one received yesterday on CNN's office in New York\nAh so these are in addition to the seven packages that we already know about that were sent to George Soros Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder or as former CIA director John Brennan and then the uh\nThe lawmaker Maxine Waters Democrats of California so that brings the total tell it to nine\nTo nine in about the past twenty four hours are law enforcement officials any closer to knowing who may have sent these packages\nOr not that we know of at this point there is no word of a possible suspect and there isn't a lot of details at this point on\nUh the devices themselves but there is a lot on the packages\nA that is that what we do know that these were were pipe bombs that's how officials have described in the packages\nOr that they were mailed in we're all identical bubble wrap mailed envelopes this is as far as the ones that were discovered yesterday uh the address is on the computer printed um the return address on each package was that of a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida\nOr some of these packages appear to have been some through the mail some may have been handled liberated uh the one that was mailed to attorney general former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed a back to Wasserman Schultz she of course did not Sundays\nUm she said that she's very troubled by the way that this is all played out that her name has been used in this her own office in fact was evacuated yesterday in Florida because of a suspicious package there\nTen let me turn this over to for a second this morning we have been hearing from the president on Twitter what's he been saying\nWell he uh send out a tweet saying and this is part of a quote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to\nAs fake news now this comes less than twelve hours after at a rally in Wisconsin and he he called for 'em all sides coming together in peace and harmony to cut out the attacks\nAnd and said that any threat any threats of political violence or an attack on our democracy itself\nYou know what I'm trying to say that very nicely [noise] see normally I screamed they want a socialist take over that was once a socialistic over [noise] I I'm trying to be nice\nI said that the president a sort of transparently saying what he was doing which is changing the tone\nIn in at this rally a in light of of the news that was around him\nYou have a ten sort of interesting that you pointed out that President Trump hasn't really said much directly about the people who have been targeted\nUm have any of them said anything right so at that rally last night he didn't mention\nMaxine Waters he didn't mention Hillary Clinton normally at his rallies even just on Monday at his rallies there were a chance of lock her up not at this rally um and uh yes there has been a response former CIA director and Trump critic John Brennan responded to the president's tweet this morning\nSaying stop blaming others look in the mirror your inflammatory rhetoric insults lies and encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful he adds\nYour critics will not be intimidated into silence well pretty harsh words\nI'm Ryan last question to you the FBI of course is investigating and what are the immediate next steps do you think\nWell I think first and foremost what this morning has made clear is that there may still be more packages out there um this is not something that has a done deal at this point\nI'm that's in fact something that the FBI warned about yesterday when it came out with the statement about what it knew at that point in time what the FBI is doing is they've collected all of the uh the materials that they have so far all of these suspicious packages\nUm the ones that they had yesterday had been taken to a lab at Quantico, Virginia for analysis to look at the types of material used for fingerprints\nOr other evidence but this is very much the early stages of this investigation NPR's Ryan Lucas ... thanks you guys You're welcome if you're among\nOr the energy giant Exxon Mobil is accused of misleading investors and shareholders an analyst about the cost of climate change to the company's bottom line New York's attorney general Barbara Underwood is suing the company for ... shareholders and NPR's Wade Goodwyn has the story\nThe lawsuit doesn't hold Exxon Mobil liable for helping to create climate change it accuses the energy giant of misleading the investing public about how global warming was affecting the value of the company's fossil fuel assets around the world\nWhat the attorney general is essentially saying as you kept two sets of books\nZillow is the director of finance for the\nInstitute for energy economics and financial analysis and former New York state comptroller ... says the allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that\nThey were um keeping so that they understood what reality was and another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public the allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interest political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing\nExxon Mobil is moved to for the investigation by attorneys general in three states alleging it's a conspiracy involving the Rockefeller Foundation tort lawyers advisor metal is a democratic gay jeeze\nMichael Berger is a professor at Columbia Law school who specializes a climate change law\nBurger doubts axons conspiracy theories are going to hold up in court\nThis is about climate change it's about the risks that regulation hoses to the fossil fuel industry over the next half century or more but this particular complaint is about corporate fraud\nAt the end of Wednesday's trading on Wall street shares of Exxon Mobil were down about three percent Wade Goodwyn NPR News Dallas [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News this CPR news on my lap and just ahead this morning or Colorado wonders projects takes him and another challenge\nAnd that is explaining one of the measures on this fall's ballot proposition one twelve would increase the distance between homes and new oil and gas wells and there's a lot more about that are coming up and just the next few minutes here this morning\nColorado wonders is where we get questions from listeners\nAnd try to find the answers sometimes uh you know those answers are hard to really pin down but it always makes for some interesting reporting and you can see more of that ad CPR dot org\nAs well as a lot more about what else is on Colorado's ballot that are in the voter's guide that can help you as you are filling out the ballot or this week or next week and selection day's coming up pretty quickly now [noise]\n\nMostly sunny around Denver this morning and the two anybody getting warmer toward the weekend high in the sixties this afternoon fifties in the mountains\nWay to look at this is to examine what percentage the industry is of Colorado's overall gross domestic product so I'm I looked at a couple of different eras\nIt's twenty fourteen was kind of the peak of the oil and gas boom in Colorado and the industry accounted for about seven percent of the state's GDP then seven percent at the height their last right\nTwenty sixteen was a low point for the industry was about three percent and twenty Eighteen you know you see about five percent so when you look at the average over ten years for oil and gas extraction\nUm you know it's really a doesn't really fit into the top ten industries for GDP which\nIs really led by things like real estate IT Services manufacturing healthcare\nOkay there comes a surprise to me what about jobs though does the raking change when you start to look at look at me ploy Mitt associated with oil and gas\nAlso not really not seeing stuff in the top ten so state wide more than twenty nine thousand people are directly employed by oil and gas companies that's about one percent of the state's overall workforce\nThe data though does not track support services connected to the industry so\nUm you know it's not capturing the number is maybe truck drivers who are driving water oil and gas drilling sites you know what one thing I Will point out here though is that the impact of proposition one twelve if it's passed would really be acutely felt in a place like weld county 'cause that's where a lot of oil and gas workers live right now because\nOf that impact might be uneven across the sailor concentrated in some communities are here's another listener question on the numbers\nHi this is any race from Louis so I Wonder how much or what percentage of the state's overall budget comes from taxes on oil and gas\nSo statewide taxes are those are something called a severance tax that the oil and gas industry pay it pays\nYou know look at between about twenty twelve twenty Seventeen the range was pretty wide between four million dollars and two hundred and sixty five million dollars\nUm that's less it sounds like a lot less than one percent of the state budget a and actually the the amount of severance tax that's paid is very small when you compare Colorado to say Alaska where severance taxes make up more than fifty percent of you know the coffers there\nI'm surprised by the range of severance tax is from year to year I guess that shows just how much the industry is prone to booms and busts\nAnd it's all based off of the price of oil as you may imagine you know one thing I really also want to point out is uh that oil and gas companies also pay property taxes local governments so weld county is bringing tens of millions of dollars in property taxes that are based off of wealth and that's been a significant support\nThey're speaking again to this idea that some places might be more disproportionally affected than others if prop one twelve war to pass Grace Hood when you've been talking with voters have you gotten any sense from them that they might vote for this proposition because of concerns about climate change\nGreat question so I was out in Loveland and was canvassing for several hours kinda shadowing the Colorado rising group was inspired mental group that in support of this you are following the canvasser I was following the canvassers and I have to say I mean I did not hear a single voter bring that up as a priority\nI understand that some environmental advocates are really bringing that up as a point but my sense is it's sort of more of an intellectual point for a groups than something that might be top of mind for the majority of\nVoters okay on a similar seem so advocates are touting cleaner air safer conditions in general what truth is there to those claims\nI think it's really important to point out just sort of laid the groundwork here um proposition one twelve does not impact the forty three thousand active wells in Colorado who was already there which I was already there what state you would only impact how future permits and new wells\nAre approved across the state and one thing we're that's worth pointing out so Colorado does have some of the strictest methane restrictions and monitoring requirements in the country\nBut there are other air pollutants let's say benzene that could escape from oil and gas equipment and I don't think that you know ... to have a dramatic effect in decreasing some of those other air pollutants because there's all these tens of thousands of wells that are already in operation\nSo you know one a area where I think potentially stronger argument could be made is that they're explosions that can happen around oil and gas wells so they are rare but a several of happened in recent years one last year resulted in worker death and Firestone we saw to residents who died after\nThis well late raw incentive natural gas in the soil so I think that placing future restrictions on wells twenty five hundred feet from homes that would presumably make things safer\nCPR energy and environment reporter Grace Hood answering Coloradans questions about prop one

the company from Dallas NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nThe legal action is the result of a four year investigation by attorneys general first in New York and that other states into whether Exxon Mobil engaged in a long running fraudulent ski what was the village scream\nEssentially the company claim but the cost of combating carbon emissions would be so high that no meaningful government restrictions could or would ever be implemented therefore investors didn't have anything to worry about and the company could pull as much oil out of the ground as it could procure\nSo yeah I think an abundance of caution given the fact that person or persons there's not been caught yet\nThese devices that thankfully and interestingly have have not detonated um which I assume leaves even more evidence in the hands of investigators does that give them an advantage that these these explosive devices are not exploding\nOil does because again it gets to the signature of the bomber or bombers

court nominations don't get a lot of public attention they usually fly below the radar but they've long been governed by an elaborate series of Senate rules and traditions that are aimed at ensuring that presidents don't have carte blanche to pick nominees now\nThose traditions are being tossed aside at a rapid rate NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story\nPrior to the Trump Administration there was plenty of tit for tat and the escalating partisan war is over judicial nominations\nBut the tactics were aimed at blocking nominees since President Trump was sworn in however the GOP sent leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges in the process ignoring our tossing aside rules that have long existed to ensure that there is some consensus in picking judges\nGone for all practical purposes is the rules that preventive action on a judicial nominee who was not approved by his or her home state senator\nGone is the practice of not holding a confirmation hearing until the American bar association has completed its professional evaluation of the nominee\nGone as the general practice of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other Senate committee has been holding hearings during the recess but for judicial nominees the Senate confirmation train keeps on running even though and likely because Senate Democrats are defending a near record number of seats in the election and have to be out on the house stinks\nIndeed just two Republican senators Orrin Hatch of Utah who's retiring and my ... of Idaho showed up at yesterday's hearing for two appeals court nominees\nA hearing that lasted just Nineteen Minutes and featured one controversial nominees talking for several minutes about his wife parents children even his cat\nI asked Senator Hatch who never agreed to such a recess hearing when he chaired the Judiciary Committee why Republicans went ahead this time\nWell I don't know why all I can say is that the you know we have to move move ahead and if they're not qualified and you just go ahead and move ahead and so far we haven't had a lot of cooperation\nGoing ahead has yielded important results for Republicans over the last year and a half\nThat you know be

Chu is the economics editor for the independent the British newspaper he is in Riyadh at this conference the Saudis are holding and I spoke with him earlier and asked what the atmosphere there's like\nWhat it was a day of high drama and onto the patient yesterday because these were the first comments by the crown prince since the murder of a hustle gee earlier this month\nAnd the whole here in Riyadh at the convention center was absolutely packed not a new report says but we've\nUm Saudi officials and business leaders who always seem to have ... the crown prince who's the de facto router of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to them a while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime he said that um that would be\nA old those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because I thought she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul\nAnd he struck a very defiant note saying that those who are trying to drive to sweat will not succeed not while I Am crown prince while my father is king\nWhile president of the gun is president of turkey and I think the context of the ... they're all those who feel the his position in Saudi Arabia is that they thought through is under threat I think this was a message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were a high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because these allegations is that absence being felt\nThe absence is being felt in terms of some of the media partnerships and some of the high profile speakers inside of the high profile pilots moderate says that said the oh western business executives had just not the ones at the top of the organizations who went on the original billing\nUm I'll have to say that keeping quite so low key profile here I think there's a sense of\nTrepidation a sense of they don't know why this is going to go I have to say also have spoken to some of them and they all sticking to the original vision they think that\nThis is a passing storm on a although you know it was a mistake and the uh the the most prestigious as the company said must be brought to justice they're not losing faith in the original vision he laid out two years ago is this event\nReally important to Saudi Arabia this investment conference\nIs hugely important it's central positive ... vision that he wants to get foreign investment into Saudi you'll see foreign expertise and to Saudi he's got a five hundred billion dollar project to build a high tech sits in the ... the needs foreign expertise on money to do that\nAre on this was one of his prime reforms full drumming up interest

allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interest political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three year investigation has uncovered no

Cleveland Cavaliers or they were down what three games\nTo not and then came back and won the NBA Finals last year\nYes but the fact that we can cite to the one or the issue of instances where this happened you know it was a the Yankees are had that three nothing lead against the red Sox in the playoffs famously but that's the only time\nIt has ever happened to a baseball history and I would say that if the Dodgers don't sweep don't literally when all their games in LA I Can't see much of a chance for them to come back\nTo the cold and for them and friendly confines of Fenway and when it in Boston can see that how\nWell let's talk about that because I I'm here are just a few blocks away from Fenway Park it has been cold it's been rainy there about Seventy degree Los Angeles does that make a big difference for the Dodgers are you\nOr your basking in the globe like that yeah that warms up there yeah and the reason that I say it does in home field per se doesn't have much of an effect in baseball as opposed to other sports\nBut the Dodgers themselves complained about it right Matt send the Dodgers pitcher said that the cold was are preventing him from getting a good grip on the ball and he used an adjective I hadn't heard in this context he said quote I didn't feel as gummy as usual when it's Seventy five\nEighty degrees yes the the cold of Boston getting in the way of ... right\nUh Mike while we have you I Want to ask you about another big story in sports right now it's in basketball I'm a top prospect named Gary is basically is skipping college for a one million dollar internship at new balance what's going on there\nTwo things one if he's getting a million dollars that's not an internship I just want to do with it\nBut she companies realize that these the very elite players not everyone but the very least players some of these guys have these high school kids have a million followers on Instagram they're they're very valuable as indoor surface\nSo the NCAA gets in the way of that and the NC double a says if you go to college you can't take any money from an advertiser but basically said well why am I spending my time in college why would a he had he had a committed or at least talked about going to Syracuse\nHe pulled out got the million dollars for just endorsing the shoe and his pro chances stay intact\nHe has to do with the reason he has a year to kill is because of NBA rules that say you can't come right out of high school\nSo I think if anything this is a good deal for the player himself and it's another indictment of the flaw the system that requires essentially indentured servitude uh at the NCAA is thinks they can continue to get something for nothing and I think those days are numbered\nWell I Will just say as the brother of a college athlete my brother was a tennis player in college\nAs sort of on the ... it was his internship worth remembering that he didn't get one but but he was sort of on the pro track and then you have to go pro\nAnd then his college education actually really came in handy and now he's gone into academia I mean there is a there is an advantage of some of these people are going to cause I guess maybe they decide there's absolutely no way I'm not going to make millions of dollars in the NBA\nRight if some if the eight hundred best player decided to do that based on a twenty five thousand dollar an internship\nWith I don't know case west are they still around I Would say it's a bad choice but if the number one or two prospect in the country who is guaranteed to make millions of dollars make that make that choice it's different and tennis is a good example because\nThere are top a tennis players who ... all the time decide not to go to college in fact going to college in a couple of sports\nTennis primary among them will probably hinder your development so you know if when your brother was a senior in high school he was good enough to which is to say Eighteen years old and some someone who should be ranked at that age you know when the top fifty and the world\nHe shouldn't have gone to college then but it's good that he got the college scholarship if he was a very good but not great or lead or possibly\nProfessional tennis player he still beat me like crazy even though he did this did not go pro or Mike Pesca here now sports analyst also editor of the book upon

are I'm Jeremy hops and investigators say suspicious packages sent to actor and Trump critic Robert De Niro and former vice president Joe Biden are similar to the crude pipe bombs that had been sent to former President Obama Hillary Clinton and other Trump critics\nJoining us now is Phil Ewing NPR national security correspondent Hi Phil Hi Jeremy and what more do we know at this point about these packages well the FBI says there were\nTwo of them address to the former vice president Joe Biden they were discovered at a male facility and Delaware which of course has his home state and then early this morning the New York police department was called about one delivered to a restaurant to kind of business address that deniro uses for his um operations in that part of Manhattan\nAnd that brings the total number of these are suspected devices to ten across a number of\nDemocratic or democratic link targets all of whom are political nemesis of President Trump one\nOf the things we do know is that there are no stamp cancellation marks on some of these packages which means these bombs may have been hand delivered a ... is that something investigators are are watching\nThey are they're looking at everything although it's not as clear cut as that might initially make it sound because some of these\nAre suspicious packages were discovered at a mail processing facility the ones that we know about that were address to the former vice president so some of them had been traveling through the mail\nUm others may have been hand delivered like the one that arrived at CNN office in New York City on Wednesday and so there may have been a mix of methods used to try and\nDeploy these things to these various address these but the postal inspection service the FBI the secret service they're looking into how these things\nGot where they were supposed to go in addition to whoever sent them and what they can taint are you hearing anything about why none of these have exploded so far\nNo except that we know one of them was protective lead detonated buying explosive ordnance disposal team\nIn New York who was addressed to the billionaire liberal financier George Soros and a bomb squad responded and protective Lee blew it up just to be confident\nWhat our correspondents understand from law enforcement sources today is that the materials from that that nation are being used in this investigation so whatever substances whatever chemistry and other evidence that investigators can take from that package that was blown up but again blown up by a bomb squad not because it went off on its own\nThat's going to go into the subsequent investigation here I should also mention\nThe bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives ATF is involved with this investigation as well of\nCourse this has gotten very political very quickly last night in a scripted remarks the president said let's get along\nBut this morning he once again blame the media tweeting the anger we

response\nDay in day out there is a negative Ninety percent of the media attention around this president negative despite his store in a job creation despite the fact that our economy is booming despite the fact\nThat what should we take from all this will what appears to be the case that the president the White House have internalized some of the criticisms that have come in the past twenty four thirty six hours\nAbout the political rhetoric in the United states its tone and its temper and the position they're taking is this isn't on us descended about me the president says this is about

you got healthy shrimp\nAnd so when you see this\nChallenge with oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with your other parts of your system\nYou make of the response from NBC\nUh I think what we saw sort of illustrated the tensions within the network over her show over the things she's been doing on the show I'm from the start of the morning show there was this tension because she was having trouble adapting to the morning format\nPeople may remember that there was a interview she did with Jane Fonda were Jane Fonda a took offense at a question that she asked about her plastic surgery I leave and\nYou know there were celebrities who were hesitant to appear on the show and and uh the cast of will and grace was made uncomfortable um in how she referred to the shows a groundbreaking legacy of\nPresenting gay characters on television and the impact on fans and\nAnd so there was this struggle you know she was struggling to adapt to the time slot\nAnd I think people were sort of resented that much money she was getting paid and you know there were flashes where her old Fox News persona would come through and it was sort of obliterate the at the at the feel good atmosphere\nOf a morning show and then on top of all of that the show was getting worse ratings than it was getting when a our ochre\nAnd a camera hall hosted a an additional today showing that time slot\nOr so there were I was there was a lot of tension and NBC about what she was doing and how she was performing and I feel like this black face incident and ... the way Craig Melvin and our ... our two African American anchors on the today show how they criticize through very pointedly NBC nightly news did a is a segment on the controversy\nBut just illustrated the tension that was going on around her\nShow and then she apologized or at the start of our show on Wednesday let's listen to that apology\nI was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great heights of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface when used an awful way by racist in this country it is not okay for that can be part of a costume Halloween or otherwise\nI have never been a kind of person but I Do understand the value in ... had said it to our history a ticket and the on race and ethnicity\nSo as we said Eric today NBC's airing a rerun of the program and there are sources saying that Megan Kelly may not return to the show at all do you think this is the end of Russia\n[noise] um I don't know that they there are indications that she's negotiating to adopt some sort of different role that would not involve hosting that time slot\nI I always thought it was going to be a tough turn for her because\nHosting a show where you're um a pundit and you're being very incisive and bold\nAnd aggressive about presenting opinions about the day's news is very different than hosting a segment at nine AM in the morning where you're expected to uh be much more friendly you're expected to be much more welcoming presence and you're also frankly expected\nTo appeal to a much more diverse audience than she was expected to appeal to\nThat Fox you know this is a broadcaster working daytime television where the viewership is even more diverse than it is for more conventional time slots\nAnd you know I I've always been surprised by the way that she could be so perceptive about how sexism works in society and be so tone deaf\nTo how race works interest in society and and and this is not the first time that she said something that's insulting about race either on Fox or um you know on our on our NBC show\nBut the same sort of dynamics when it comes to gender and sexism she seems to do very well with and\nAnd so that's a disconnect that is tough to understand sometimes with her how can you be so effective in rooting out or sexism and talking about that on the air there'd be so terrible and understanding the same sorts of oppression that people of color face every day in America\n...

Cavaliers or they were down what three games to none and then came back and won the NBA Finals last year\nYes but the fact that we can cite the one or two instances where this happened you know it was a the Yankees are had that three nothing lead against the red Sox in the playoffs famously but that's the only time\nIt has ever happened in baseball history and I would say that if the Dodgers don't sweep don't literally when all their games in LA I Can't see much of a chance for them to come back\nTo the cold and for them and friendly confines of Fenway and when it in Boston can see that ...\nWell let's talk about that because I I'm here are just a few blocks away from Fenway Park it has been cold it's been rainy there about Seventy degree Los Angeles does that make a big difference for the Dodgers are you\nOr your basking in the globe you know like that that warms up there yeah and the reason that I say it does in home field per se doesn't have much of an effect in baseball as opposed to other sports\nBut the Dodgers themselves complained about it where I met send the Dodgers pitcher said that the cold was are preventing him from getting a good grip on the ball and he used an adjective I hadn't heard in this context he said quote I didn't feel as gummy as usual when it's Seventy five\nEighty degrees yes the the cold of Boston getting in the way of ... right\nAh Mike while we have you I Want to ask you about another big story in sports right now is in basketball I'm a top prospect named dairy is basically is skipping college for a one million dollar internship at new balance what's going on there\nTwo things one if he's getting a million dollars that's not an internship I just wanted [laughter]\nWhich companies realize that these the very elite players not everyone but the very least players some of these guys have these high school kids have a million followers on Instagram they're they're very valuable as indoor surface\nSo the NCAA gets in the way of that and the NC double a says if you go to college you can't take any money from an advertiser but basically said well why am I spending my time in college why would a he had he had a committed or at least talked about going to Syracuse\nHe pulled out got the million dollars for just endorsing the shoe and his pro chances stay intact\nHe has to do with the reason he has a year to kill is because of NBA rules that say you can't come right out of high school\nSo I think if anything this is a good deal for the player himself and it's another indictment of the flaw the system that requires essentially indentured servitude uh NCA is thinks they can continue to get something for nothing and I think those days are numbered\nWill I Will just say as the brother of a college athlete my brother was a tennis player in college ...\nSort of on the market was his internship worth ... right now he didn't get one but but he was sort of on the pro track and then you didn't go pro\nAnd then his college education actually really came in handy and now he's gone into academia I mean there is a there is an advantage of some of these people are going to cause I guess maybe they decide there's absolutely no way I'm not going to make millions of dollars in the NBA\nRight if some if the eight hundred best player decided to do that based on a twenty five thousand dollar an internship\nWith I don't know case west are they still around I Would say it's a bad choice but if the number one or two prospect in the country who is guaranteed to make millions of dollars make that make that choice it's different and tennis is a good example because\nThere are top tennis players who are all the time decide not to go to college in fact going to college in a couple of sports tennis primary among them will probably hinder\nYour development so you know if when your brother was a senior in high school he was good enough to which is to say Eighteen years old and some someone who should be ranked at that age you know in the top fifty in the world\nOr he shouldn't have gone to college then but it's good that he got the college scholarship if he was a very good but not great or lead or

you know these are human action figures wearing your stuff\nFor tens of millions of Americans to watch and it makes the advertising a\nReally redundant at that point and it's much cheaper way to do it\nBig time college basketball programs obviously want the best players so there are scouting and competition in recruiting them and I think most of us would figure this would focus on high school players you know juniors and seniors who who proved that they have the chops and they visit their families they do what whatever to try and get them interested in their program\nI learn from your book this starch much much earlier how young are players when they started getting attention\nFifth or sixth grade players are as young as\nTen or eleven years old when the basketball ... scouts start looking at them and saying are you a future college prospect are you a future NBA prospect\nAnd there are several reasons for this one of them is the size of players who make it to a big time college basketball and the NBA\nYou know there's somewhere between six foot three\nAnd seven feet and up so that really narrows the population so if you're looking\nAt a young kid you're going to mostly look at a kid who's already begun already athletic\nAnd for that reason and some other reasons it has a relatively easier in basketball to look at a sixth or seventh grader and correctly say this kid's going to be at least the college player so it becomes worse it for the scouts to then prow the sidelines of\nFifth and sixth grade basketball tournaments\nOr their national publications or online sites that actually rate these players that\nHave a lot of readers\nYes there are publications\nAnd scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called hope scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis though I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know spends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from\nFive or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who reiterated the highest\nLot of them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so we certainly not write all the time but he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what Clark Francis does whether you take them seriously or not is he lays down a foundation\nFor people who then scout high school and middle school players and he sort of sets the sort of number of players who may be looked at and\nThe recruiting services are and other business another way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots\nBasketball network explain who runs that how it works\nMain recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIt's no longer high school basketball you know a high school game\nFeatures maybe one star\nThe kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid\nSo what's the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations that's where the college coaches go to scout\nAnd the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball it's sunny was\nHigh school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family they\nFly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere but\nThe assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nIt was clearly not the first time the Brian bones senior had taken money he testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money repeatedly um four in return for his son playing for particular used teams or\nParticular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins wanted the the runner these street agent said Brian bow and senior on cross examination so you've been pimping out your namesake since she was fourteen years old\nAnd Bryan Boone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old\nRight and is there any evidence that Brian bone and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nRyan Bowen junior\nHad told the FBI and he told me when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know the money was exchanged that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he didn't know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina took him in is an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said you can't\nPlay basketball last year and then rolled did he could not play college basketball this year and burned bone junior has gone off to play professionally in Australia a and is over there now in Sydney has become more of\nA thousand overseas players trying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino ... the the coach was on the cover of the book um\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption in recruitment Pitino is a fascinating character um you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius\nAnd to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanna Kentucky\nWon at Louisville you also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville he did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams\nMost national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know is head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the ball as it came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know ... ... for him to be caught up in this is a a predictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\nAnd she was sent off to prison or but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank at ... for the rest I was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was many ways more serious in Louisville it became known a stripper gate\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from ... office\nSponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the in in the NC double lays lexicon at strange lexicon this was road to be permissible benefits to amateur players\nAnd Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of in that was sort of strike one strike too and this recruiting scandal\nUm and Pitino was not charged um but it involved staff members and involved a recruit involve Louisville move it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\nAnd in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\n... and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem\nAnd Pitino does not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says\nAnd right now coach Pitino has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nMike ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball this is fresh air\nAnd it's still a little bite of news you get throughout your game all

book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news or people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked what the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was\nThat the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\nWhen you're done for Don ... know you make you tell me and they create\n\nAnd how can we do you understand\nYeah [noise]\nYeah they kind of you have to find the right place you have

now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over there they joined us from our studios in New York City hey there David Hey Audi so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person who was like on Halloween or black or white like that that was okay as long as you address the character\nAnd that of course that tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one of which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks\nI and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin depressed the newest co host of today's show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um

defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off

migrants making their way north as part of the caravan\nThere so far from the U.S border a thousand miles or so\nIn response to the United nations refugee agency un agency are his and dozens of staff to southern Mexico to help with asylum applications I reach UNH ER communications officer Maria ruby there she told me about Seventeen hundred people in the caravan have already applied for asylum in Mexico\nReact to that Mexicans are making processing these applications but also a provided legal advice ... people that are in the cab that if they ... to ...\nI mean it's still a person is that each comprised of people who are migrating and not have to find\nAnd at a time of life and people now that running away from conflict and ... in that context of Huntington\nSo you're saying that there is a mix of both economic migrants and people who are seeking asylum because they fear of persecution in their home countries or fear violence do you have people in the caravan who are making it clear to you that they wish to go to the United states\nOr not they may come as we have a Supreme venues that they are seeking flat out they can't live in that that's not necessary in the u._s. but within Mexico\nThere has been a lot of concern in the U.S about the numbers of people who might be trying to apply to asylum in the U.S has un agency are received any pressure from the Trump Administration to process people they're\nNot not that time that that are ... I think it's I think it can be very clear we have actually three offices in South and Mexico whining and I joined I ain't gonna see can I can say\nThat you have any ... like we are facing currently is that in the house in the Mexican government receive around almost six thousand\nPages for asylum\nThese theyll be that would take you need to go see their Asian they they had like ... we I think in Benghazi will receive the end of September ... drinking fountain obligations\nUNH ER is identified kidnapping and other security risks is that something you're talking about that's a risk within the caravan or from outside of it\nI think outside of the cat that we have nothing to Cyprus fat these things are just I Love the fact that the kind of I think you might not\nLike we are advising people they used to be careful to be fired for federal rules that they don't look I notice a my face I mean I Would have had it on the\nFats and they can be either ... or Richard that set this fake\nUm as we mentioned we're catching you as you're traveling along this group was there any a person or family that stood out to you or them or their story\nI mean and they can and you come back and not for feminism ... gel gyms and and that's not much ikea than I ... a song and a peep from that dream and when they decided to leave that country is because they don't have anything else\nThey gave me the ... between negative safer high\nThat they they've decided to leave and I think we had an artist to survive\nMaria Rubio is a communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us from ...\nWell President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nThis is actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places\nLittle search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want\nThings to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of violence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars and other places around the world to try to stabilize places\nTo make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars and\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported\nBack to Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aid the United states is a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but\nAlso in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and said those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them to do\nNow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments\nTo protect their people\n... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure

wouldn't end up the way came out one of the things that was so shocking about them was there sort of very free use of of curse words however that's not to say that massaging new and kind of awful ideas and stories weren't conveyed without using curse words because there were\nDefinitely a women counters that and by eighty eight we see a sophistication and relevance of women and hip hop that I

House\n... ...\n\nThe death of journalists ... has strained ties between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and it stirred up rivalries in the middle east between the Saudis the Iranians and the Turks\nTurkey has been strategic and dominating the narrative and earlier today NPR's Deb Amos told me that Turkey's president isn't just trying to gain an advantage over the Saudis\nHe also was playing his hand to improve relations with the U.S if it's they've been terrible over the past year on a variety of issues um but you know it's on Bo I agree is working with Washington on this particular event\nAnd the pressure comes at a time that the Saudis and the Turks are on different sides of this regional cleavage and it goes to this question about how majority Muslim countries are governed\nThey favor Islamist activists for example the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis the U H E the Egyptians they hate those people are they put them in jail\nAnd so for for turkey it it is good for them to see the Saudi leadership in some ways shaking their reputations question because it is good for turkey as a regional leader\nYou know in the U.S policymakers are so focused on the divide between Saudi Arabia and Iran um how has around played into this\nStory if at all oh they've been very quiet um and in the first two weeks said nothing I'm only in the past couple of days have we began to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThen on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how in the century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weak and they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and when I think about the Trump Administration\nUh and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the answer to their conflict with Iran and away right I mean the Saudis backed president when he pulled out of the Obama era nuclear agreement with Iran on what does it mean for Washington's or on policy\nThat question has reportedly been part of the White House calculation as the whole story unfolds here is why Saudi Arabia is critical to the Trump plan to squeeze Iranian oil imports\nIf you take a rainy an oil imports off the market and that is exactly what the Trump Administration wants to do you could drive up oil prices gas prices in the United states if you don't find a way to fill that gap\nThat's what Saudi will offer they are the only oil producer that has spare capacity and they have said that they will make up\nAny deficit in a rainy and crude and cheap oil prices steady now so far\nUh Saudis energy minister has said this is exactly what they're going to do they're going to open those caps this all begins on November fifth\nAnd November fifth what's the significance of that date November fifth is when the U.S sanctions go into effect that is when it will become very difficult for the Iranians to sell any of their oil on the global market That's NPR's Deb Amos thanks so much for explaining it thank you [noise]\n\nUm\nYou're listening to all things considered

are headed to the U.S Mexico border the ... sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with\nWisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and insurance partly because we really reward\nIllegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] but I don't know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and that was found units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when was there that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now through for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed to we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I\nA lot of folks in gangs water drug dealers carry guns are only about five percent of those folks repeatedly pulled the trigger\nChoice that's helping law enforcement be more precise means they are less destructive to a

ideas\nTimes are changing and life just change I'm CPR is getting larger and they need to because you need to cover so many things so if you're giving or re release think about giving a little bit more\nConsider making five figure gift like the apple dead at CPR dot org\nTo talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies welcome to the city among either we don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages of what's known so far but how they were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted at this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service\nOr the packages address for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service and two of the packages addressed that Joe Biden were also founding postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because it USGS has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like this\nWhen it comes to mail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening\nProcedures so it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance maybe most importantly is who that package is going to\nIf you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious looking items so these just suspicious items that we're talking about\nA period of a sense using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nOr at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with they can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a wind going through their own male\nAnd the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have caused can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they that the U.S postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective\nI specifically when it comes to investigations\nUm they open Nineteen investigations into a hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being um are trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hopes chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions or in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics\nOr is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nUh not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now I talk with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials and the media members in the case of CNN who seemed to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who were carrying packs point a to point B were also in danger in these situations\nUh if you remember back to two thousand one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers or who died back then\nUm so there's no indication that any policies are going to be changed but we're definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's Miles Parks thanks so much thank you to another\nThe story now about methamphetamine which is making a comeback addiction
