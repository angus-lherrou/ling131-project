I guess as\nFully engulfed can fire\nAnd I remember this guy on the\nYelling at me to get on the ground and roll and I did and ended up rolling down this hill next to the bike path there and this poor guy he's just out\nAnd joined the beautiful Sonoma County day riding his bike and next thing is he's witness to this horrific thing and he's sitting there scooping dirt off the side of the trail trying to get the fire out on me\nAnd it wasn't until the\nTrue brand name from the yard with a fire extinguisher\n... before they finally got the flames out\nReduce scooped me up on the back board and\nThey had to go a long ways to get into the ER and\nWhere they were working hard I was of those left Kerry [laughter] and uh\nRegard could yard I was calling out orders was when there was always very I've even when the nurses the patient yeah and I was telling them it's like\nThey're going to have to innovate me or took in a lot of smoke and fire\nAnd I don't know how long are we going to last you're going to appear to be in a baby right away and\nThey think we're just trying to reassure me I guess going in and\nGot in there and they were really having a hard time finding access for medication I make so so badly burned and\nWhen they finally did and that's\nTo remember lovers and then\n\nThe crash ultimately killed the pilot Patrick Haiti had injured Dave's fellow flight ... both the less severely as we came to learn video of the incident and that just blast from the fuel tank proved pivotal in the case against\nThe helicopters manufacturer Airbus and its operator error methods\nMeanwhile across town Amanda ruptures phone rang it was a colleague at the hospital Amanda is a nurse too and this co worker explains there'd been a crash Dave was alive but she should come to the hospital fast\nAnd it was July third in Suffolk County which is the first thing at the scenes with traffic and people and and a lot of people have asked me what I said or what I was thinking or what I did during that drive and I honestly don't remember\nIt was just no we needed to get to the hospital and when we did I jumped out and I ran into the ER and I got into Dave's room and I took one look at him\nAnd I knew he was so badly burned\nI just looked at him and I said\nYou know uh what's his core temperature how much fluid if you're given him and I just wanted to nurse mode and everybody was like Amanda we got we got it and uh I just stayed with him and\nEverybody was doing their job and it was an incredible feat for all those people in that year because it wasn't just day that was also Patrick and Matt and all three were critical\nAnd all these health care workers that they knew it was all family taking care of family in a time of incredible crisis and I've\nThought about that [noise] that\nThere's not too many times I think that you can\nLook at a situation like that for the medical team and they were all doing their job amazingly so when the helicopter came\nTo get days victim to Denver take 'em to Denver I knew\nI couldn't fly I mean I Know all about all of that but I asked anyways because I was honestly afraid he wasn't going to make it to Denver and I want it to be there with him and of course\nThat wasn't an option we loaded him into helicopter and the winds have started blowing in the rain was starting and Peter that she flight nurse was hanging on to me and I looked at him and I just said are we\nPutting are really putting them back in a helicopter right now he's going to be okay and he just said yeah\nThere'll be okay Amanda and\nI knew if he wasn't in a helicopter and he didn't get to the burn center as fast as he could he wasn't going to make it\nThey lifted off and I went into the ER and\nI said I needed to see Patrick and\nOur friend was outside the front door and he just looked at me and said the doors close these Amanda you didn't make it\nAn open the door and I walked in and Karen was there with Patrick and it was just the two of them\nAnd I hugged her and we were both crying\nAnd she said man I don't know how to\nUnless\nThe whole time I thought this was going to be me\nAnd I didn't know how I was going to happen [noise] if I walked out of the room and I collapsed and they\nPut me on the tree odds journey and\nAnd that's one wrong the nurse who had been taken care of days came up to me and I didn't know him\nAnd he said you don't know me but I was taking care of days and I need to tell you that the last thing you said\nWas Taliban dog lover\nSo you got that message I did\nAnd those words were very powerful\nI hung up to them for a long long time\nBecause it would be a while before he spoke to you again five and a half months\nWhen we come back Dave rupture arrives at University of Colorado

Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan ...\nIt's a survival story that makes you wonder could I have made it through what they did a flight nurse Dave rupture was burned over Ninety percent of his body after a flight for life helicopter crashed shortly after take off their shoes in Frisco in twenty Fifteen\nHis wife Amanda herself a nurse learns that doctors had given him a below zero chance of survival\nMore than three years later David still under close medical supervision and the couple keeps the apartment they rented in Aurora to be near his doctors see you\nHave seen forty three specialties I think if a spittle forty three I didn't even know there were them now I think forty two I I mean I\nI didn't realize that are that many either I Would joke with people in the hospitals to I Know there's one we're never going to hit and there'll be\nYeah [laughter]\nThe ruptures have kept their sense of humor their hope and they owe that partly to a burn psychologist who's worked with them as many specialist as David seen he's had even more procedures I asked him to name a few\nI don't know if would be easier but\nYou know you've had fifty two surgeries\nYou know fifty one yeah I think if the ones who has\nActual chips are and and so he's had multiple other\nProcedures at the bedside and hundreds hundreds of things like that\nThat includes a Coakley or implants Davis on such strong antibiotics they affected his hearing but he really only started to turn a corner to feel human again after a kidney transplant\nWhy did you need a new kidney\nSo part of the burns process obviously can damage your kidneys with all the\nMaterial gets released into your blood stream and basically called them up and then also the ten months of antibiotics shows\nSo we can we finally got out of the hospital and can look forward to coming home to the apartment I was doing diagnosis or a hospital still\nAnd we're getting trained to do on dialysis at home\nThis whole apartment it was that good feeling with boxes and we had the dialysis machine right next door you're sitting and\nThat was his dials yes I'm In the diet as a ... you know\nIt keeps you alive but you're certainly not living in August of last year I had my transplant my health is better dramatically better my\nStamina is better I can be on the heat I can sweat I can drink I can eat it was all these things was one of the biggest things that we could get\nDid meant returning to their active lifestyle even if it isn't quite like before\nSometimes it I Can't help but think when I go out and do some of these same hikes and stuff that I used to go run around and now it takes me two hours of huffing and puffing to get around you know it's just a\nThings like that I guess we've changed\nAmanda says Davis been hiking himself back to health but good health isn't the only thing they've worked for they also want justice the helicopter crash shouldn't have been as deadly and destructive as it was the fuel take the lead to David Byrnes was unnecessarily flimsy so it was a seat\nThe fuel system on board was not a crash resistant fuel system\nAnd the fuel tank ruptured\nJustice explaining that cold splash the day's remembers feeling\nYes and and then here she is like a\nBecause you're sitting right in front of its\nCars no figure then I think he was\nFrom some of this stuff was eleven millimeters thick\nAnd it's just plastic it's a role model plastic very brittle\nAnd you're sitting right in front of a\nRiver the seat was not rated to the latest standards for crash impact it was an after market seat and David Was actually adjusted with the seat still attached to him it came off of the helicopter and he was injected head first into the fuel spill\nIs basically built off of standards from Nineteen sixty five\nAnd that's all they had to\nDid you give it some thought\nThat your your life was changed by eleven millimeters of plastic\nDo whatever you use his disappointment\nYou know the people buying in developing those helicopters is just disappointing that they they knew it was out there ours was the first crash\nThe FAA is known about this since the seventies sixties Vietnam War when all this technology was being developed\nIn the military was the first one to adapt mostly standards they realize\nThat people were unnecessarily dying in post crash fires when they were not injured\nAnd they fix the problem in other words the crashes into problem necessarily if the aftermath much cash pricing realization of course\nI mean at some point physics takes over if you have a crash hard enough\nPut all you want is a fighting chance\nWhat are you most hope for in the future or biggest hope\nOne person and that's it\nIn the future can walk away from something like this\nWe hope it'd be more than that\nA lot of people need to take a little more responsibility for this\nIndustry needs to change their behavior the regulators need to change their behavior\nThere needs to be greater awareness amongst the the people getting into these helicopters and\nYou know it's not just their medical there's companies in the Grand Canyon that are flying six hundred thousand people a a newly\nWith these same kinds of old helicopters sightseeing news Hawaii the ... yeah there's helicopter's us utilize is the most helicopters in the world and people have no idea what they're ...\n[noise] both\nAs for what caused the crash federal investigators said it was likely are preventable hydraulic issue the rapture sued the manufacturer Airbus and the operator error methods\nAnd eventually settled for a hundred million dollars in the ... will use some of the money for a new foundation partly to help other burn survivors but the settlement will also pay for Dave's lifelong medical\nCare who wouldn't wish this upon anyone but\nSeeing how people can come together when they really want to it's been\nBeen really special it's straight strangers\nWe're through window July

Ibrahim is facing the first test\n... times political life ... and it was called into any of this year after being jailed for alleged soul to me and try to Fifteen is running in a parliamentary election today is expected to win boost his chances of succeeding laziest prime minister ... Mohammed\nVenezuelan government says just released a political prisoners being held for four years mostly in the country's intelligence services building in Caracas Condes appear reports\nOf Venezuelan government TV channel ... official statement saying that Lawrence Sunday was a student leader had been freed and was being flown to Spain and his and his family's request it said he was being accompanied by Venezuelan officials was being released because of consent she might take his own life\nFor trying to preserve safe human existence on the planet we're trying to preserve the lives in chances of among the most vulnerable people as well because the most vulnerable populations those who are already poor\nOr or elderly or have more difficult circumstances will be the most affected the first affected so I think that that has to be your absolute priority and from that perspective economic cost is necessary it's not that it's it's just in an absolutely necessary investment\nNow of course they're all going to have to be very very big changes and we're hopefully going to talk about this quite a bit\nUm including the fact that we're talking about energy rejections so not just energy efficiency that reduction in total levels of energy demand\nEspecially in the interim because we've really lost his problem to too late we've really been delayed by all kinds of problems um such as a climate denial is and influences of big fossil lobbies so\nBut we usually about reduction of ... of of energy use you're talking about people getting out of that cause and walking all cycling or using public transport for an\nAbsolutely absolutely and so especially in the interim we are talking about reducing our energy use considerably um however uh the research shows in my research and particularly I'm as well as others that energy consumption does not necessarily mean living standards so it is possible to have a perfectly good quality of life\nAnd have lower energy use but the infrastructure has to be there at the infrastructure has to be in place such as public transit ... cities that are safe to cycle and walk in that era\nLordy as an adult do you think that people living in cities as they do now especially in the developed world are going to see it quite positively is a\nWell in fact what we know that people in cities have generally lower carbon footprint when compared to people who don't even see the if I think just in my experience coming from Cambridge this morning I was biking behind Abbas and there was black smoke coming out of the bus I think that in you know it's easy to see particularly on these area called benefits\nFrom changing most of transportation what some of the state today benefits are from review saying things like oil consumption\nBut in terms of the ordinary people and you if you say to them if someone who drive to work every day holiday going to feel about getting out of that call and try to use public transport it's a tough off\nCertainly I think ah even though we have a short period of time um\nI Would argue that we need a combination of\nTop down leadership in terms of what leaders that they see the level that the regional level and at that national level do and we also need lots of my campaign send movements that try to convey some of these benefits of\nChanging the way in which we work but I think you're right that the notion that from one day to the other we're going to get people in London to completely change the way they go to work for example or in other places\nAnd enough instance London's about example because actually they release in ... public transport infrastructure in place there are many other cities where it simply doesn't exist\nIndeed so we have these long timescales that are required to putting the infrastructure as Yuri and ah and Julia mentioned um but we need to get started today so I think the fact that this is hard ah precisely me is that we need to get started today with these both top down and bought them up\n... says so far we've had from people who are thinking about this in an academic way if you like you've got to try and sell this to the public isn't it like ... to the Christmas\nBut I truly don't agree I mean I think of getting people to get us Cohen still sitting in a traffic jam is that she couldn't appealing us going if lots of people go to the cause and we're on the bus it wouldn't be the traffic down so everybody get to it folks to suit you know the private ... not the answer to freedom all happiness and if you sit on the bus then you've got lots of people to ... way struggled\nBut that's one of those are the reason that there are plenty of people who do see that individual is being in the car or something they value very ...\nI think a lot of people actually enjoy public transport when it was well if we think about young people now a lot of them uh choosing not to drive particularly if they live in cities where the public school it's good so is it I think is the others have said it's more important that you have good public Jones bull\nSo you give people the real choice to make I didn't think anybody really enjoys the moon and commute switching for two hours in a lot of traffic and he said the same about having to commute to work you know why do people\nLive so far from where they what we can change systems have mobile home working people working full day week so they have moved on relationships the kinds of things that make them happy because the way the economy's working at the moment is actually creating a mental health crisis as well as an energy crisis so you know we can rethink those systems and people will be actually much happier\nFootball this is a very particular view of of the world and how we might want to live in it but let's take another example think about aviation people love flying the gig on holidays that are traveling for all kinds of reasons howling us would something like aviation fish in to a much greener well\nWell the um new climate economy which is a reporter was published in September ... lays out a way of a restructuring the global economy in the way that allows us great for freedom and greater opportunity for a a more sustainable growth model\nBut we have at the moment now there are going to be in many of these places like the power system we know more or less how to do it there are going to be some different more difficult problems\nSo cool part to it by sectors including things like shipping aviation some forms of money\nTo steal but there's great technological development going on\nAnd there's usually crossing I think isn't isn't isn't\nKnown other people are working on this all across the world a new development going on there's a report you out of the end of November Bobby energy transition commission which will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development of battery technology is not happening so quickly\nThere is a prospect of short flights being possible using ... technology supports same wave law a long distance trucking you\nWon't be easy now it's like they I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to buy specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels that are currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every mega Jewell is among those is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nYou know everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that\nThey're actually putting things and you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging TV isn't can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that people especially at the same fall we just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important that people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better call legalized say don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is by lowering their missions and one in which people's living standards are high or\nLow it is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten thousand people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause death and equate long term creeping coffee I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra seat if prices seem that you cannot another country and in other countries have\nHeard the most are low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no Lewis says what do we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think\nThere's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get the short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nEverybody will have to move their money out of folks who feels and tools a sustainable future instead so there's a lot of power we have politically over the economy and we need to use that to shift probably just investment\nGiven given the kind of levels of of votes that policies like you'll get do you think there is public awareness public support for those kind of policies\nWill in terms of sustainable finance I went to another report here in the parliament and it was suppose you'd really gross you know really took us to the right wing\nOf the people who were elected but I didn't think this is an issue that's not exclusively to the ownership of one party will politicians all focused on this and that's how I managed to build a strong ... really to support an important and powerful position on sustainable finance\nLet's try and understand the practicalities for a moment before we returned to the politics when we look at renewables are we working towards having enough renewables to power our ... our needs by themselves billboard\nWell in the u._k. for instance we've been making a very big switch\nTo a low carbon forms of power generation particularly drive in coal off the system so what's happened since Ninety nine to use the u._k. has managed to reduce its\nAnnual emissions of greenhouse gases by more than forty percent of its economy is growing by more than Seventy percent third has demonstrated that tackling climate change does not mean you have to sacrifice economic growth\nIt hires with a relatively modest\nCarbon price and wise investments in the development of renewables managed to drive coal almost completely out of its power generation system is set itself I conservatives talk you know I think of getting cold down to zero by twenty twenty five\nOr does mean investments out front but in many places the price of renewables per unit was just being coming down far quicker even but most economists have anticipated and then in many parts of the world it is now cheaper\nTo gain electricity off from renewables even in places like Texas they have discovered the wind and solar is far cheaper than relying on coal or gas or the other forms of\nJulius on big lots of good news that say renewables are going up but all day reliable enough and is there a place the nuclear power and all of this\nBefore we talk about nuclear I think that we need to touch we need to talk about two different things one issue is that renewables happened growing and the cost has been coming down and this is good news however they've not been driving fossil fuel is off the grid\nAnd in the case of the u._k. maybe we're not using coal as much but just this week the government has given the go ahead to ... for fracking at the press to new roads site which is very close to Manchester why live the local community has been up in arms against it\nAnd the local authority trying to not allow the planting site and the central government forced them to except for fracking on their location so very anti democratic decision\nAnd three protesters were recently sentenced to jail time we do have a mixed picture and I think that we know we we need to focus our efforts not just\nOn developing renewables and driving their prices down and incentivizing renewable production but we actually do need to shut down fossil fuel extraction and development\nAnd the other two separate efforts why I don't think that we can count on sheep renewables it's too much to ask of sheep renewables to drive false will seals off the grid that's something that's a political decision that has to be taking the little lord another at another level as already\nHas on it and we were in Norway last week where they openly admitted that they may have a great sort of hydro electricity system themselves one of the reasons they were able to do all this was off the back of the sales of ah oil and increasing the gas well\nI think as Julie saying we need action across all areas and they see the one point five report talked about energy talks about land use talks about CDs and talks about industry\nAnd it's true that renewables themselves kinda do everything it's of course easier to make these investments if there's a lot of surplus however I must say that Norway actually ... some some um an outlier in the sense that it has been wise enough to sink\nIn a long term way about all these revenues not all countries\nThat have um I'm a raw materials and other resources I'm happy doing it [noise] um I think um\nWe need to you know you you mentioned um retail at the beginning um that the summary or if our previous conversation was that this one point five it's perfectly do uh well I Would like to kind of real\nDo just that there's an optimism that they ...\nThey should not be mailed them but I think is really important to note that he's extremely hard that we need all options that we need action from all sectors we need to find those community we need to police the community at all levels\nA ... and we need um they they National Community so we really need everything and I think\nThat is an enormous challenges in it and I were going to talk about politics in the moment but if you talk about the north south divide within the world if you talk about the divisions between America and China I mean there were so many stumbling blocks to achieve what you're describing\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that it's a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or four different policies\nMostly I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear what's your view to nuclear power not ready to clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five dollars and make it ... and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrifying of energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo when some evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make Monday's IPC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's been him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck with us effective leadership isn't this last last\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide your date and of course that's true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from power as there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't know the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives you a reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning United States is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other forces such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts all becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh it's with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nSome of these challenges with us and I think ah well this is because democracies are very good benefits today costs in the future and in fact here we have a lot of class today and kind of more feature benefits but I think we can highlight in particular policy actions that the local level that the Reagan level at the national level\nFrom the perspective of these benefits that we will have today or in the short term and we talked about some of these health benefits\nThere is some of the call benefits that we can talk about some of them might be health ... jobs\nAnd let me bring joy that back in the streets are we talking about benefits in the future\nIn developed countries people didn't like having stuff taken away from them they don't want to know that they don't want to hear that they called by more clothes or and you call in a country like India where people are aspiring to those things are aspiring to the refrigerator then moved to bike and perhaps the call how honesty persuade them to say you know will you didn't want this stuff\nBasically people want to have a good life\nBut they don't necessarily want to have throwaways things that you throw away every day so if you just take the case of plastics\nThem onto plastics me throw we consume huge amounts of fossil fuels as well as energy so the question is how do we use\nThe existing culture in different countries in the world to try to focus more on quality rather than quantity so it's not as if you want to really say that you should buy less\nBut why can't you buy better quality was very poor person in the air is that even really an option no but to put up a lot less than he has the right of course to improve his life all her life\nAnd I think the question is much more about the rich the question of inequality was brought up we know that you know one percent of the world's population seems to have as much as the remaining Ninety nine percent and that's also true for India do you need much more equality within the Indian society as well and more sharing of the wealth\nI went to a feature view a final question all begin with you you're in ten years time if we're going to follow those recommendations and the reports the findings the report we would need to be well on our way to reduce ... emissions so do you believe given what we know now about a\n... on the United states global attitudes that globally we will have achieved that that we will be on our way\nThrough this report says read it off for by the governments and mobile feeding to political procedure is at the end of year and over the coming two years governments who have all these scientific evidence and sit around a table so\nI really do hope that governments take into account the scientific evidence and put the rope on the tractor worth reducing global emissions Laura\nIn ten years time I think if we have countries that put in place you know the politically viable taken back policies to create coalitions of winners that reduce the costs to search that invest in innovation at that emphasized fickle benefits maybe [laughter]\nWell Bush\nI don't think we have any choice but to believe we time because the alternative is we just give up and then it's all do so on\nOne doesn't want to be overly optimistic about it more people have to engage with politicians and say to them we want to choose the future we have because there is in the future not just for the people here and now\nIt's the kind of well we want to leave to our children and grandchildren I think most people won't the well to be a better place for their children grandchildren than they currently have\nJoined the group the court cases in India and in the U.S by young children are asking that governments there doing enough\nSo I think that when you see a whole sees all four cases where people who've tried to put pressure on that governments need much more leadership policy entrepreneurs in social movements to get this going actually desperately need the help of the gym and his Judith ... I Would agree\nTo that and I think we can't wait for ten years I think that every decision we make and every anybody who's listening to this trying to think about how you can form a neighborhood group to talk to your friends your neighbors making meeting with your local and he\nWe need to get moving every single decision we make every single hour we spend every single piece of information we can bring into schools and bring up for debate this is something that's going to take all of us and it's going to take all the effort we have\nTo keep the number of to be honest dead people as low as possible\nAnd ... well I think\nI Am bringing good news really from Brussels because we need to do more we've made very strong progress in terms of industry and an energy systems when I was working on a sustainable finance or gender the stove or the unsustainable sectors and especially for for ... over\nThe finance that they need and I think the ... that we haven't talked about very much which is absolutely crucial is changing the ...\nEat so that ... meat and we'll protein coats and changing the way they said that we use the land and natural cup and sing and will say something will treason and have aquifers the system so it's still under way I think there is a lot of ...\nGreats will not nationally still Kay says joy to go to your ear a gal new ideas on it on board ingenious Steinbeck yeah thank you all that sit for this week on the real story\nIf you'd like to listen to the program again or any other from the ... you can this back on line by such info BBC the real story and if you like this week is probably going to make sure you never miss another edition and subscribe to our podcast\nYou can find is simply by such that the real story in your pocket cost ... and we love to hear your thoughts ... that's the real story at BBC don't Kindle e K\nFor me with the lead shot on the team this is the real story for this week thanks listening\nYou're listening to end up news from Colorado Public radio on Ninety point one F.

that if I can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of this like coming from their healthcare neurons\nBut it's also about what they're
