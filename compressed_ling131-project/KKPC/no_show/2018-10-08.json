know that the earth has warmed by about one degree Celsius since the Eighteen hundreds what has that meant for the earth\nIt has meant for human health for our well being for the ways we make our living for the kinds of hobbies we enjoy outside\nThat there's already been changes in a number of ways that are harmful to us and to the ecosystems to the nature that we enjoy our enjoy\nYour report this un report explores the consequences of further warming a warming of one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to one degree to which we have now that is not a big jump in temperature but the report says there will be big consequences\n[noise] it does indeed the report is based on a large body of scientific evidence that indicates that with each additional unit of warming the adverse consequences from that warming grow quite a bit\nDining with the adverse consequences actually looked like\nThere are places where it will become more difficult to grow our crops it'll become too hot and too dry there's places in the world that are already water stressed and that water stress will increase quite a bit with additional warming\nHeat waves we've seen quite a few heat waves in the U.S and around the world this year people die and heat waves as the temperatures go up those heat waves become more extreme and more frequent and unless we take action than the projections suggest more people die and heat wave\nSeveral governments speaking of action several governments asked the United nations to put this report together what will you tell them they need to do\nThe report lays out very clearly where we stand with respect to the risks of a changing climate what those risk how those risks will change as temperatures go up\nAnd the various options to those adapt to what's going on and to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions so that we could in fact reduce the negative consequences that are projected so that we don't have to see all that's projected if actions taken urgently\nAre
