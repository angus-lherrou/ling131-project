emergency management agency says it intends to conduct the first nationwide test wireless phone emergency alert potentially reaching upwards of two hundred and twenty five million mobile devices being as Wade Widmer says it's hoped the alert could reach a wider group and through broadcast media alone\nThere's a lot of discussion and concern about the ability to warn or Americans or people in the United states of emergency is the only the radio and TV\nI think it's it's up for grabs I really do much polish and Mr Stapleton need to spend some time down here they better pay attention to us\nSo have pulled us in Stapleton been campaigning in southern Colorado\nYeah they had the mean at ... attended or health forty events according to his spokesperson and Stapleton has been down there it quote unquote dozens of times but they cannot has yours is Colorado treasure\nBut also I should note that the the day I called about this the hour I called about this Stapleton was delivering a speech in ... and then moving on to the San Luis valley\nSo according to the campaigns the candidates are there but so far it doesn't sound like their message that's connected with the voters in southern Colorado in a way where they feel like they're listens tell\nBut let's look at this from campaigns perspective because I did some math and eighty percent of active voter\nIn Colorado live along the northern front range so in places like Denver Fort Collins Colorado Springs the suburbs around all those places right why should people in these places be concerned that\nVoters in more rural parts of Colorado like southern Colorado you don't feel listen to you don't feel like their priorities are being represented [noise]\nSimilar tastes just like other person's happy to\nThat's not going to make the point I'm trying to make is that that in a democracy you know you want the majority of people to have a say and if the majority of people have in the urban voters\nThen I'm not sure we should be protecting the voices of rural voters at the cost of bourbon and sort of [noise]\nThe first thing that comes to mind is like it's okay to one good things for other people's\nMy second argument would be a you know people moved to Denver and to Fort Collins or in Boulder\nAnd the other places right like Colorado's a beautiful state and we don't live in a city just in cities live here because of its proximity to everything else the veil to crested Butte and southern Colorado like there's some really cool things down there\nSo I don't know ... do you live in the same neighborhood as Walker staple ten or ...\nNo I'm not going to say where I live for the purpose of this but I guess but I don't think I live near you\nOkay so I think when someone who lives in Boulder lives in some Denver suburb cares about Pueblo or cares about Grand Junction um or cares about northern Colorado it sends a message to the rest of the state that they care about them too\nAnd the other thing I Would say is I'm a justice reporter and I cover a lot of rural jails and I've been in a lot of ... and I will say that the opioid crisis in San Luis valley and the overcrowding you know if one part of the state it's economically suffering we all pay for that\nSo now if you know freshmen philosophy here that's okay that's allowed for the show okay great so so earnest but uh let's think about utilitarian if I'm right and that this was the idea\nIn philosophy that a moral decision is one that does the greatest good for the greatest number of people right right so if your governor that means your decisions would be for those people along the front range where most people are there is another part of utilitarian is which is\nThese decisions or or or moral and good if they if they lost to the long run I Would argue that over the long term\nColorado it'd be better off if if it's candidates for governor really did eventually everyone everyone\nThey knew Alison thanks for coming it was awesome Sam welcome\nTo this episode of purple Bush connects with a newsroom wide project from CPR called road trip\nTo November Allison innate and many other reporters here have traveled the state to learn what people are concerned about the head of the midterms\nLeading up to election day they're going to go to share what they heard today I'm joined by Allison as well as John de Leon Andrea Dukakis to talk about the governor's race in particular\nAnd a welcome to all of you nice to see when it's too soon to enter you were in another part of southern Colorado driving highway fifty from the San Luis valley to Durango\nRough gig ... drive you're generally what did you hear about the governor's race\nWell I asked a lot of people I met about the upcoming elections and they didn't seem at all focused on the governor's race\nThis was a few weeks ago so things may have changed but no one brought up the race unless I asked them what they did bring up over and over again we're concerned about drought water and lack of water many of the people I talked to live off the land are farmers and ranchers\nI went on a ride with Alan most that county commissioner dairy is Alan and it was also a rancher he wears a big cowboy hat and boots and he took me to see land that he says it's usually super green\nBut not so much this year and like others he told me he's not happy that both candidates for governor or from the front range and thinks they don't understand the lives of people I Can't\nI've talked to divert oil that come out here in a totally OK I'm all for you to treat her today to two hundred and fifty girls a tone in our poll calf yesterday for the Lakers backwards I don't know what that's all we have those real groups like when you're\nI mean this is also a part of the state where there's a lot of poverty and it's been hard hit by the opioid crisis over Ninety percent of folks admitted into the Alamo Allen most of the county jail excuse me test positive for heroin so I guess people feel like there are a lot more pressing issues I\nOnly heard about water to um I was down in ... county which is east of where Andrea was on and I talked to in ... county commissioner who is also a cattle rancher and he was saying that they a lot of people on where he lives cut down on their cattle operations during the severe drought at twenty twelve they got rid of cats\nAnd they've actually built them back up since then\nAnd now because of the severe drought particularly in the southern part of the state they're really struggling because they're just because of what Andrea said about the grasslands the other thing I Want to say is that everybody in rural areas talks about health care costs are real concern from among Democrats and Republicans\nThere was a woman I talked to was running fruit stand in rocky Ford and she pays\nSome more than three thousand dollars a month for her and her husband for health care and she's a Republican and she elected Republicans to fix this and because the last two years have gone by and there's a Republican Congress and Republican president\nAnd there's been no fix she's very disappointed\nThese are issues that the candidates have weighed in on particularly health care policy or did the people you talked with connect those concerns to the candidates' positions\nEnsure they hear the candidates talking about these issues on the news and in campaign ads but they say they want the candidates to visit the area more often and see for themselves how things like the drought in heroin effect\nSouthern Colorado Jason Anderson county commissioner and to watch\nA lot of people I think would say look if you take the time to come that's half the battle right there\nAnd you know I mentioned this on purpose to but the candidates actually are visiting there according to both campaigns have been down there you know a few dozen times\nI think just their messages aren't resonating they don't have that populist feel that at that that's making people feel like they're being listened to and are addressing that anxiety\nI can tell you there's a lot of Democrats are excited about having German POWs from the lieutenant governor from the same region in Colorado we were hoping for lieutenant governor from Pablo or from the rural areas\nThat was that Gilbert ... or ... he's the clicking recorder and public county\nOkay John daily you traveled a different route I Seventy ... east of Denver through to a Grand Junction very major artery obviously and I imagine people on that road may have a very different sense of the race for governor\nYou know it was interesting I got the sense that this race resembles the broader national political landscape most of the folks I spoke to were either strongly backing Walker Stapleton or German polish or hadn't thought about it much or didn't want to say and I talked to a few Coloradans who are totally overwhelmed by the flood of campaign ads\nAnd seem more interested frankly and talking about the Rockies Rocco did you get a sense of national politics are having an effect on the governor's race I really did you know in in Jefferson County I met an educator a Hillary Clinton voter who strongly supports Jared polish\nJulie ... has been fired up by national politics and President Trump who she considers immoral she thinks Colorado needs polish and Democrats in charge here as a counterbalance to Republican control in Washington\nWe need to pull everybody we can a different direction because I mean I think the ... the the way Colorado is going right now under Hickenlooper has been fine but I think with national politics the way they are we need to do what we can locally to combat those movements\nYeah I got a sense from the Democrats I talked to that national politics overshadows everything right now that state politics is just knocked their priority made sure they want a democratic governor but they're more concerned about making sure Democrats win more seats in Congress to counterbalance Trump\nAnd that's interesting 'cause I got a totally different than down especially in ... I didn't feel really any to that at all about the top of the ticket in this case the governor's race and that might be because I was talking more to Republicans\nAnd blue dog Democrat to you know didn't seem to be as excited about Jared poll is what I did hear about all these local races under like Fifteen people I think actually more than Fifteen people running for mayor and ... there's also this open county commissioner racer signs all over town and there's debates and\nSo that's really what started me down this path that sort of thinking All right well maybe there's more to the sun I originally thought and a vote the credits last name um he was so I had asthma I asked my dad and my dad said I'm not entirely sure so I'll ask your grandfather and my grandfather said oh yeah\nThat's my cousin he used to come to the family picnics and measure people's heads with caliber\nAnd always practicing so I always practicing science and would just\nTo this eccentric guy and I thought All right well and he's a relative to so now I really have to do this\nAh what evidence did he find that convinced him of the creatures existence or or convinced him at least enough to try to find out\nThere's a system yeah so he saw the casting of a set of footprints of ... poor plaster into a footprint on the ground you can preserve all of the detail and and that's it's called the cast\nAnd he saw a set of friends that had been made up in Washington state and one of them was crippled and he said the end of the er an anatomical detail on them was so good that there is no way they could have been staked and that's what convinced him this would have been back in the seventies at some point\nI understand that his widow actually lives in Colorado and Parker I think yes are you also interviewed her does she believe in big food\nShe does and actually that you could say that big but played matchmaker here because she had read an article in the paper talking about how this scientist in Washington state believed in Bigfoot and he's this academic and she said well I've never\nHeard of anyone who had these kinds of credentials saying that big foot was real and all she started writing to him and then he came to Denver for a lecture and then they met and it was romance\nYou're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and Denver journalists Laura ... is my guest she used to be with NPR she has a new podcast the first episode dropped today it's called wild thing and it is a serious investigation of\nThe existence of big foot of sasquatch and it is also an exploration of the popular culture surrounding this beast which I Want to get into but if\nHe believed this anthropologist and your relative that big foot was real\nDid he have some theory about what space occupied in and a male yeah or in ... evolution or what\nYeah so Grover thought that big but it was a descendant of this giant this now extinct giant Asian ape called gigantic ... is\nThat existed you know a million years ago and his ... was it was it a descendent of that come over the bearing land straits as apparently we do yes oh well maybe we might have come and vote for that is true yes I don't know if it took about\nUm but yeah the idea was its descended from this particular species so it's a in the order primate fasten it there's a hope the second episode is all about evolution\nOkay how ingrained is sasquatch in in our popular culture which would say\nSo it's hard to really quantify it but I Will say that when I started thinking about big foot and this is probably going to happen to you now to if you're in the grocery store if you are at a bike store if you are anywhere you go you will see references to big foot and sasquatch their socks there's chocolate there's bikes there snowboards\nThere is erotica as we all know there is um there's all kinds of movies there's a publishing company and it's kind of everywhere you look so there's a lot of appeal out\nThere as we all know there's erotica okay I didn't actually know that but I'm learning things from Laura ... in their series you will visit Bailey, Colorado the home of the sasquatch out post\nSo this little section here's on footprints including these tracks [noise]\nThis is our map of Colorado sasquatch sightings Arctic foot he recalled boomer\nAnd you'd be shocked at how many people never see this they come in the museum they walk around the leave and never even see this big fur and hair and this was a centerpiece of all museum\nTell us about the origins of this sasquatch out post in Colorado\nSo Bailey is a tiny little sort of to horse town and this used to be the old grocery store that was there so back in the Eighteen hundreds and its shuttered many many years ago and this couple Jim and Daphne Myers bought the the grocery and turned it into sort of a grocery store slash\nBigfoot thing 'cause Jim is uh he he is a very serious about Bigfoot\nUm but he also recognizes that a lot of people are fascinated by it and so it was still part grocery store and then part Bigfoot outlet kind of thing\nAnd then they realized that they could just make all of their money doing the big foot ... ... actually they totally ditched the degree does and they just had the sasquatch outposts where you could go and get hiking and camping gear and all kinds of sasquatch paraphernalia and then they opened a museum\nOr sasquatch discovery museum which you just heard the the sounds from that a little who ding owls and stuff and they have a map in there and have some discussion of the different evidence and there's a giant big foot sort of tucked in behind a tree that if you weren't looking you might miss him which goes to show you if you were out in the woods and you weren't looking you might miss him was\nSpeaking of that when I think a big foot I think that I conduct photo of him\nOr her a look\nFacing the camera a stride did you learn anything about that image oh my God I learned so much about that image dry\nSo that is from the Nineteen sixty seven film called the Patterson gambling found so it was shot just over fifty years ago and I actually went to the fiftieth anniversary celebration last year which is just about a year ago\nAnd it it is a lady Bigfoot striding away through the forest and you know there's all kinds of theories about whether this is a legitimate this is actually Bigfoot or if this is a man and a monkey suit\nOr you know a hoax of some sort and this film which is only a minute long and it's very shaky footage\nUm it's been just analyzed to death it's been stabilized and slow down and re mastered and people have spent hours and hours and hours I said I heard one guy told me that it's been watched second only to the Kennedy assassination\nRouter fan yeah podcast of course her sound driven which got me thinking about watch sasquatch might sound like you delve into this uh I think digging up some tape from big foot research Web sites\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nLearn anything from sounds [noise]\nUm [noise] well not from hearing those particular sounds necessarily you know people will make recordings of stuff that they hear in the woods but the problem with that is unless you see what's making the sound it's often hard to know what's actually doing it\nAnd I heard several stories where people had thought they'd heard of big foot they'd recorded it they brought it into some big but to oppose them and they played it for the whole audience because they were so excited\nAnd someone's like yeah that's an elk or that's an adult so that the sounds are a little bit tough but you know they if you're out in the woods and you hear something like that and you're alone and you're camping that's going to make the hair on the back of your next end up\nHow do people answer the fundamental question that a big foot existed we would have seen it by now we just be more acquainted with is especially with you know satellite imagery and as much development as there is in forest land and the growth of the population in the west\nMhm I think that is probably one of the hardest questions to answer um some people just say that it's very good at staying hidden and staying out of sight you know other people will say hey we are seeing it there are eyewitness accounts it's just people don't believe\nThem where do you want to end on this more crime oh I don't know if I Want to give that away oh say that I definitely want to believe you want to believe yeah are you glad you took it on me as someone who's taking on what what some might consider more serious topics\nYeah I think this has been it's been a lot of fun I met a lot of interesting people and I mean I learned some cool science along the way\nDenver
