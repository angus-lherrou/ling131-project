a in a way politically homeless Mm [noise]\nYeah she's deeply frustrated by both parties and I'm sure she'll vote this election and I'm sure that she'll vote 'em for a Democrat but she'll do so with strong reservations\nLet's talk more about immigration I think that's a an issue that that is certainly top of mind right now\nWith ah the focus on the so called caravan uh and uh now the question of whether you should be a citizen if you are born in the United states on on this land\nHow did you sense out people's deep\nFeelings about an issue like immigration by asking them about their parenting style for instance ... help us understand how you've tried to get a fuller picture of the electorate and if these as you call them hidden ...\nWell first we got a lot of brat so we ask questions about sanctuary cities we ask questions about a border wall we ask questions about the contributions that immigrants make to society so we asked all the questions you would ask in an ordinary question if you're trying to understand people's\nPerception of immigrants in fact one of the things we learned from that especially in the in depth interviews is that people always started by drawing the distinction between people who've come here legally is intending to become an American citizen and people who come here with undocumented status [noise]\nThen after all that Brett we analyze it along what we can refer to adapt which as understanding people's moral values their parenting styles their identity\nOne of the things that was really telling from doing that is that especially as you move move to the right on the spectrum people really identify with Being American it's a source of enormous pride to them\nThey might say that they're an American before they said that they are Christian that's how they wake up in the morning they feel like there's a culture and a history there that they really embody and care about is you moved to the left people have increasingly said that they feel a bit of shame about America and its past and they don't identify with Being American as a central part of who they are\nNot to mention is really important facet of the conversation about immigration because the the categories that were afraid to citizen and non citizen have a lot more relevance to some people than others\nAnd that touches on patriotism for sure and and even the use of that word in our youth patriotic and you'll find that to be very strong among traditional conservatives and devoted to conservatives less strong among progressive activists in traditional liberals\nIt's interesting how that ensure plays with President Trump's message of make America great again and\nI mean in a way it seems contradictory if you've got the conservatives who vote for him saying America's great now I'm I'm proud of American now\nMhm [noise] yeah I think there is a sense um among especially the devoted conservative these are the most\nFiercely loyal to Trump that today being an American citizen and your rights are less valued than those of an immigrant they really believe that strongly it's one of the things that distinguishes and the most from your kind of traditional conservative\nAnd so they have a sense that society has kind of come to seek revenge against the traditional white conservative I'm American um and that they are now turning the tables against them and you're listening to\nColorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're talking about a new study of the hidden tribes of America it is an effort from a group called more in common to bring more nuance\nTo polarization in this country my guest is Steven Hawkins who is research director for more in common this group that works to reduce polarization in democracies and we've talked some about how core beliefs shape our political identities\nA ... that shouldn't facts play a role too I mean we're in an era where basic facts are in question the the greenhouse gas effect or whether a rash of non citizens voted in the last election\nUh I I ran across it twenty sixteen buzzfeed survey of social media\nAnd it found that right wing Facebook pages published false are misleading information\nThirty eight percent of the time left wing pages did so nearly twenty percent or than there was a report from Harvard in twenty Seventeen\nOr and it concludes that well any group can become a to believe false information misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right an extreme voices from the writer been continuously attacking the mainstream media\nCan can fax cut through tribalism mhm [noise]\nRight well absolutely facts have to continue to dominate they have to win out truth has to win out\nI think what we found is that especially on the right there's this sense that the appropriate subjects of conversation have gotten narrow where the discourse cannot go in every direction and especially in talking about crime and talking about gender and talking about sexuality\nThere has been a fencing off of certain ideas which means that there's a suspicion that not all of the facts are on the table because on certain subjects there's already a right position a correct position that one has to hold morally\nAnd as a result they feel as if there could be some chance that this story that's not getting a lot of play is actually true but the media or polite who are aligned more with the left are less likely to talk about it\nI think what you're hinting at various political correctness or and and this is I I think in part with the study finds that liberals bears some responsibility here for the nature of the national conversation\nRight political correctness has a really challenging concept to nail down because we found that um what some people refer to as censorship\nAnd a and a kind of policing of speech other people say this is just the norm of polite society we're trying to avoid offending people and that's a good instinct not one that we should try to\nReduce or roll back\nBut we did find a surprising majority of Americans expressing that they felt as if there was pressure to think a certain way on specific issues related to race and racism especially related to Islam and Muslims\nI'm related to gender and sexuality and we found that four out of five Americans at least to some degree I think the political correctness is a problem in America today\nSo what that indicates to us as we need to reduce the kind of control over the subject matter of conversation a little bit allow the conversation to be a little bit more free flowing why\nDon't we wrap up with a question of how to get beyond that tribalism are you ready to get in this study about these hidden tribes and what do you suggest as a way for folks across this spectrum these\nTribes to see each other less has caricatures I think that's how you put it in this study are more as whole people are and perhaps to get the kind of discussion started that you\nHave alluded to there the first I Would just say is humility personally I Am somebody who has moved a lot around as in terms of my political identity I started off on the right of shifted to the left\nI've moved back and forth and in fact you see these trucks reflected in your own family even in my own family indeed from the left to the right and met a lot of really decent people across the spectrum and in this study again I met so many very good intention people across the country who just have sharply different\nOrientation towards the world starting with a place of humility says what if I'm wrong or at least what if I'm not fully understanding that this person is I think that's the great a great starting point\nIs that message being sent from the top of government though\nNot from the White House I Would say that we do not have we have 'em too much bombastic and self aggrandizing speech from the White House not setting the right tone thanks for being with us we it's the tip of the iceberg fascinating stuff Steven thank you so much for having me\nSteven Hawkins of Denver is research director for more in common which fights polarization and he is lead author of hidden tribes a

progressive people with us and I think when we have what I'm Sorry to refer to his boots on the ground you know we'll have more people I'm from the front range visiting because we're you know more of like uh\nHead for a lot of the cycling industry now they're\nA beach I'd say more about that well we'll have a building up um you know we have a lot of contacts in the front range we had a really good reputation in the front range so when people come through Grand Junction hopefully they'll come come to Grand Junction set of through Grand Junction um they'll ... they'll basically have a place to go now\nYou used the word progressive that's kind of a loaded term these days and they're obviously big political differences as well between Boulder and Grand Junction or think of that is a much more conservative part of the state\nIt taught me about how that played into your decision and what the perception is in Boulder if you're moving your company Rocky Mountain west\nOkay so I'm In graduate there's definitely a little more red in Boulder I'm being sarcastic and saying that but I realize the loom or being as the ... the uh you know it's a big oil and gas out there but the good thing about Grand Junction is you know Seventy five percent of its ... there's a lot of room to spread out\nSo some of the problems we have in I'm In the front range like you just spoke about the fracking problem comes from too many people in ... she too concentrated area out there there's a lot of room to spread out um I I understand what the oil and gas guys do I do drive a car to get on airplanes I Do need fuel so I can respect what they do and I understand it and I think they have a good balance of it out there\nWhat was the reaction in Boulder to moving Rocky Mountains to Grand Junction\nOut what the hell's wrong with you it was one of them um everyone was shocked um I was really surprised you know we had a lot of press on it and I know a lot of people in the community so I'd run into people and they're like I Can't believe you're leaving 'em because I've done a lot of work in that community I'm pretty well known 'em and it was a it was a shock to a lot of people that we were just pick up and leave what do you think\nPrompted them to say that but well hind that are you crazy sort of idea\nI think people are just so used to seeing us seeing our car racks I'm seeing my my activity in the cycling me there I'm I'm a fixture in that community and just to sort of rip off and remove that to these ... to that community is a big deal we\nSpent ah just under a week in Grand junction a earlier this summer reporting on the fact that a lot of people are moving there from the front range who are tired of the crowds here and the traffic\nAnd the cost of living for that matter a I remember meeting a teardrop trailer manufacturer who relocated his business from the front range\nTo Grand Junction very similar I think to your story talk about maybe some of the economic pressures on the front range that informed this decision to move to the western slope\nSo we could have pulled something off in Boulder it would not have been would not have been pretty and it'll be financial leverage the rest of my life\nI did have a a deal on the table I tried to get going an eerie I'm didn't pan out\nA city or he didn't want me and then I had the on the table or in city Lewis fill in an office park and uh the process to get through um the building putting the building up with the St Louis felt in Boulder County is very difficult and very expensive with sewer taffy water tapped fees impact sees the schedule fees was a full page long [noise]\nUm so I called city Grand Junction because we need to be on a transfer transportation network and I love the riding out there\nAre obviously on I Seventy yeah so we have a ... year we got the highway there Salt Lake so it's a great transportation network which we need 'em and uh when I went out to a Grand Junction um\nThe people in the front range all the communities and all the cities were basically telling me to get in line to get your checkbook out and get mine\n... Grand Junction wanted us and they're building a really great public park right in the Colorado River with a commercial lots and we were I'm fortunate enough to get one of those so we locate in our business to 'em\nApart right in the Colorado River which is to give away from Grand Junction no not at all um what they're doing is they want to diversify their economy out there because it was based on heavily on oil and gas or they want to attract outdoor rock\nIt has been very susceptible to booms and busts yes it has so they do need to diversify their economy so they're they put this park up um and it's it's great the way they did it there's a [noise]\nIt's about forty acres and most of the land is right on the reverse for the public and then serves heading north I'm away from the river there's a commercial lots are using for outdoor Iraq so the first two companies to going where bombs I designed was the first one who's a visionary the park in the Rocky Mountains was the second bonsai\nDies zip lines and sort of outdoor playgrounds or speaking again to this idea that the diversification of the economy in Grand junction is very much to do with the outdoors industry\nYes exactly I'm In the city Ron Johnson's realized that end up I mean it was it was of we're so fortunate flying into this with the city I'm the mayor even said after they voted on our proposal um Rocky Mountain exactly the kind of company we won Grand Junction near listening to Colorado\nMatters I'm Ryan Warner and we are speaking with Bobby noise who's the founder and owner of Rocky Mountains a Boulder bike rack and lock company he's picking up and moving to Grand Junction a that is part of a trend\nOr as Grand Junction looks to diversify its economy and frankly lord businesses they're even from within Colorado so I think you have twelve employees yes now and are are most of them moving with you\nWill probably get about half about half\nHow was that conversation with the employees it's interesting um a lot of people I'm excited about the move some people have children and they can't pick up and move and I respect that and understand that so I've been open and transparent with everyone\nThe interesting thing is um we knew some hiring lately and we're only gonna hire people that will move the Grand Junction with us so I had a couple of ads out on indeed in Craig's list and one of the requirements was you have to move the Grand Junction with us\nAnd I was amazed I got fifty resumes for one position and uh everyone told me the same story of these guys I was interviewing excuse me men and women I was interviewing they said I moved to Colorado for the cycling\nThe fly fishing um skiing and they said all I Do is sit in traffic all day and this is not why I moved to Colorado so this is a great opportunity for me it sounds to\nMe like this this is about growth for you in other words the growth was just not as possible along the front range as it is on the western slope\nYeah well we've always been hamstrung by real estate costs in Boulder um if we want to you need more warehouse space is really expensive the we'd guys really drove the price of warehousing in Boulder so we never had excess capacity sorghum and tore now in Grand junction there's a lot more real estate available to us it's ... so we can actually grow the business now\nWould you say this is an awfully big question here or what would you say is the state of cycling right now in Colorado what space does it occupy I don't know like recreationally but also as a means of getting around not just for fun um\nIt is for the recreational aspect it's doing well the roads are getting crowded and you see a lot of people getting off road bikes Roebuck sales are down there riding gravel bikes mountain bikes more\nUm some of the recreational side them out like stuff is growing which is great on gravel growing in the road seems to be declining a little bit interesting um and then from the commuting aspect um I see some of those problems there's more people here I think people are riding bikes more you know the state's been great about putting a bike protected bike lanes\nI'm so to cycling commuting is growing the struggles I see is that there's more traffic on the road and a lot of people are scared ride their bikes\nThanks for being with us ... perspective like humor document much Bobby nice if the founder and owner of Rocky Mount ...
