Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Andrea Dukakis and I'm Ryan Warner an explosion in Iraq changed Steve baskets his life in two thousand eight he was in the army guarding a general\nI thought there was merit and a meeting and protecting someone or protecting life\nThat's the kind of guy Steve is he was in a convoy in Baghdad when a roadside bomb went off\nIt killed a good friend of mine and he was like a father to me my team came to my rescue pulled me from the vehicle really the important thing is they saved my life and and and I'm here today because of that\nAfter the explosion Vasquez was in and out of consciousness and remembers waking up with patches on his eyes\nLaying in the hospital bed and touching my eyes and trying to imagine what happened in in where was\nHe was halfway around the world in Washington DC at Walter Reed Army Medical center and he was now blind for\nMe I share and darkness into a still world and that can be very suffocating and I'm just left with thinking 'cause visually I'm not distracted Sean stuck in my mind constantly\nWhat gets them out of his head is movements and he often finds that movement on Colorado's rivers\nAnd I like to say that moving this living and so when I get out on water is very dynamic is very flowing it's alive underneath you and to be able to come and kayak through whitewater a with a guide and navigate through six features which I think this white water park cash you don't feel as disabled\nThe baskets and I are sitting on a park\nBench next to the ... river in ... from the western slope\nBaskets first came to town as a visit to kayak with the veterans for now he's moving here which is exactly what folks in town was\nIn the last six years Montrose has tried to reshape itself as a destination for vets place that will ease the transition to civilian life\nThis effort is called the welcome home alliance for veterans and at\nThe heart of it not far from the river is the warrior resource center\nWe have a display cases of different memorabilia that a lot of our veterans have brought in that is meaningful for them\nExecutive director Mike tricky and I take a look around one of the main gathering spaces and there's a big round table in the middle I'm seeing how that were part of military uniforms\nThere's a scale model of that is the US's Montrose the U.S has ... well that's a nice name we like it we all like it I can say oh I see a lot of uh flags in the triangle cases I remember receiving one of those when my grandfather in the air force passed away\nAnd those are of flags representing some of our veterans that are have passed away since we've\nBeen here and what is this place what is it what does it do it heals\nIt affords veterans opportunity to just be themselves\nTo engage in conversations with each other to share their stories\nWar stories war stories stories of of how they struggled to get back into society other successes but it's an opportunity to do that in such a way that they feel safe they feel comfortable there not judged are you a veteran is\nSpent four years and ring for\nSixty eight Seventy two and a [noise]\nYou're tearing up I Wonder why [noise]\nI feel very fortunate to be in this position right now or I can listen to and relate a lot of the experiences\nThat veterans have when I see men and women here in the center talking about\nTheir experiences and and seeing that camaraderie that is created you just can't help\nBut to be moved by that\nIt seems that fundamental to this is the idea of veterans being with other veterans so helpful to have someone who gets it exactly\nEspecially the combat veterans um\nThey have a very unique way of communicating with each other when you mean it's almost surreal show I'm trying to see\nGrown men\nGet emotional and the similarities of their experiences\nAnd that may be across generations it's my understanding so it might be someone who is in Operation Iraqi freedom relating to a Vietnam veteran\nAnd a Korean Veterans relating to the Gulf War\nWondered haven't VFW use an American legion been doing this work for a long time\nYes tricky tells me but this is a community wide effort the alliance lobbied the VA to get more housing for veterans in ... it became a clearinghouse for services and open this safe place for veterans to gather it also got local businesses to offer veterans discounts shopkeepers put a little sticker in their window\nThousands of vets live in this county and if they need anything chances are they'll find it at the warrior resource center because people constantly donate things good electric\nWheelchairs list or those chairs carriers feels chairs\nCanes walkers transfer boards a back races\nThis is John Davis he served in Vietnam and volunteers at the center unlike Steve baskets the blind veteran we met earlier Davis has been in Montrose a long time and he says he noticed a shift when Montrose decided to lay out the welcome\nA man and his wife and two girls came over and they said a thank you for your service and that was the first time anybody they're said to me that was a little over three years ago as probably happened meet at least two dozen times since you're more\nI don't know you can't keep track you know but you came from a war that a lot of people were hesitant to say that about two veterans veterans came back from Vietnam and they were treated like like dirt in many cases it's right\nDavis's own story of service is unforgettable his job in Vietnam was to sweep for land mines with a bulldozer with a big old blade\nReinforced belly pans cover and what we did is we started at daylight and more than ... rolls over thirty two and we'd clear Fifteen sixteen hundred acres of daily level\nI Can't imagine what that job must have been day in and day out in other words you were hyper vigilant you were on edge I'm assuming I don't want to put words in your nose but if I were in that job every second of every day I Would have been thinking is this my last second is that an accurate description\nAnd it gets to pull that we don't care\nYou got a job to do\nKeep your guys\nHow does that affect you in the in the decades afterwards that for a year of your life you were in that sort of had space\n... that I'm\n... now\nYou know and I'm back there today\nIn your head and uh\nWhen you come in here and made her new vet\nAnd matter of where he's been\nYou know and you say certain words in that discussion\nThen you're in it\nTerrible vocabulary of war yeah it's a good description Davis says the highlight of his week is a Thursday morning meeting of vets which he jokes is a dangerous place to be the submarines run it and the army's accepted but you wouldn't\nBelieve what happens here on this table on
