marks on the child um he was coming to school in December without shoes on\nAnd he was removed from uh Denver public school and a few months later I'm starve to death basically\nIn both those cases the home schooling or sort of excuse was used\nAnd you know and there was no evidence that any home schooling took place new found that\nOnly two states require background checks on adults who provide home education Colorado's not one of them a bit on the other hand privacy is a big part of this debate I mean if you spoke with James Mason an attorney for the home school legal defense association\nThat organization represents eighty thousand member families across the U.S including some two thousand here in Colorado and he told you quote\nHorrific cases create horrific law and says it's it's not fair to scrutinize family's home school because of isolated cases of abuse right what what do you say to that and I wonder what kind of reaction you've gotten to the reporting\nUh-huh well a lot of angry home schooling families ah who's but again this is not intended as as you know an attack on those who legitimately are home schooling their their children\nOr you know his reaction and I and I think his reaction is indicative of this other than that uh home schooling advocates have taken any time there has been\nAny attempt to strengthen the laws are the safety net is that it's an intrusion it's an invasion of privacy and that it is not fair because the vast majority of them are doing it the best they can to to educate their children and have no intention of abusing their children\nAnd they should not be required to exchange their privacy for the safety of a very few\n[noise] it seems to the law might be narrowly tailored to those parents who withdraw their children from particular district and who have had cases are reports of alleged abuse\nWell a number of the child advocates I talked to seem to think that that would be a good idea that has certainly in the case of a child who has been\nUm the subject of an investigation regarding abuse that there should be some kind of automatic follow up with windows child children are removed from school California tempted something like this but I think was not successful California tempted uh after that trip in case they did um introduced legislation that would have required\nAn annual visit among other things in any will visit by some one outside the family someone who would be a mandatory reporter like a teacher or a a health care professional\nWith a child at least once a year and that met with fierce up

making sure everyone who can vote gets the chance to that includes people behind bars and on parole\nThis time on ... CPR is political podcast what's behind this effort and what impact that could have beyond the election purplish host San brushes joined this time by CPR is criminal justice reporter Alison Sherry [noise]\nI'm just we're going to a secured area so I Need to make sure you go ahead and weapons or anything on your ... can be used against you or or stuff\nLast week I went to Denver's downtown detention center it's one of the biggest jails in the state it's a big grape ... building unless called facts\nWants to go up on the floor I mean are we going to have some kind of emergency up there and if we do just formerly altered everything you'd agree to do their own Carolyn ... [noise]\nAlso Jerry is Colorado Public Radio's justice reporter she visited this jail to see something pretty remarkable a voter registration drive [noise]\nSo I spend a lot of time in jail [noise]\nEspecially ...\nFor your be ready to retire in your shoes and these\nYes yes exactly because it might be not because I've been sentenced anything and Denver's disability isn't nearly as run down as most places it's actually pretty new it was built in twenty ten derby claim flood walls and the cafeteria there's lots of natural light at his basketball courts attached to every pot the bathrooms let's nice and new and\nClean and this Bush to register inmates I mean how does something like that even work in jail\nRight gentlemen morning\nIt was actually pretty cool you know that said joint effort by local criminal justice reform advocates and the Denver clerk and a quarter and it's pretty straightforward you know they stand in front of the inmates\nYour civil rights your constitutional right to register to vote and vote\nAnd ask if anyone registered to vote and they had pieces of paper and clip boards and that's it\nAgain here's why isn't for two thousand Eighteen in a midterm election marks a very important election year for you guys right Colorado you get to decide who the next governor will be and\nThat's just in Cooper he's the deputy director of the car do criminal justice reform\nClash and our team is here to get you registered to ensure that you receive your ballot the vote in this year's election\nSo he was standing in this thing called a pot and it's just open area that split into two ... basically where all of that people in jail spend their days on exercising and and hanging out\nThe guys he was talking to our knowing him they're reading books are sleeping but most of them were standing above kind of on the balcony like staying on the second\nFloor or on the first floor and listening to hand if you gave this kind of rousing stump speech even though you can find behind these walls your voice is not combined and these people in the Denver jail or they actually eligible to vote yeah you know most of them are this is a jail not\nPresenting the prisons run by the state added partners corrections and presidents are mostly where convicted felons or serving out they're setting says a longer sentences you know years and\nJails are run by county sheriff's and people who are in jail or either for a child I haven't been convicted of anything they're just sitting there and they can't posted bond\nOr they're serving shorter sentences for misdemeanors both of those categories of people if you're serving time for a misdemeanor or your pre trial hasn't been convicted of anything you can definitely about in Colorado\nAnd did most of the people in this jail realize that did they know that they would have the opportunity to vote this year\nNo and that was the big point of this effort you know it seemed like a lot of the people in jail were surprised that they had the right to that\nNo no no I didn't I didn't know 'cause I have two prior felony convictions or I mean during the times before\nAnd how did they ever be able to register to vote unless someone brought their voter registration chew down I mean\nThere ... remember did you see\nPeople will actually registered to vote yeah they were all gathering around these cables selling outlet or registration and there was this one guy I talked to the needs are met Hugo\nI'm a veteran [noise] um I also am a member of the OJ thing she committee is well hum and although my vote in everyone's vote means so much right now and he\nReally feels like he has a lot at stake personally in this election\nIs currently under consideration here and dealing with um he and other other issues and the way that again different parties for a view that I'm really impressed by by greatly right no I Do think um and so\nIt's not just a chance it's absolutely time just to do it or not vote on my my vote is\n[noise] is everything right now for me [noise]\n\nAnd this effort it's much bigger than just that one voter drives I attended and the Denver town\nThis is Colorado matters from CPR News I'm Ryan ... it's a priority for this state making sure everyone who can vote knows that's actually the case including people in jail but should the right to vote include felons we continue now with ... the political podcast from CPR\nHosts San brash looks at what it could be next in Colorado When it comes\nThe inmates and elections the bill we're talking about this episode the one that gets parolees in Colorado the chance to pre registered to vote\nIt has a redemption story of its own it died and was resurrected and that's not something that happens very often at the Capitol let me explain Senate bill one fifty ran into trouble and it's very first committee hearing it had Republican and democratic sponsors but Republicans on the panel they weren't so sure about it\nYes someone is off Pearl\nReally wants to know it should be their responsibility\nAt first the bill died on a party line vote with Republicans and opposition\nAnd send it on the ski fails\nThen a day later one of those Republicans decided to revive and\nAs\nThings that I'm sure I Know he has some good discussion yesterday and I haven't voted on the prevailing side of set up about one fifty I Move for immediate and a reconsideration\nThe change of heart came from state senator oh inhale a Republican from Colorado Springs\nSometimes you have to have the humility to admit that you don't make the right vote and marry that humility with the courage to change your vote I guess we won't parolees to become productive members of our society\nAnd we would be foolish to diet and the chance to prepare for the responsibility the constitution very clearly give them [noise]\nIn other states like Florida and Virginia the voting rights of ex felons has become a brutally part is an issue\nBut in Colorado it has its share of Republican champions not just hill secretary of state Wayne Williams is also a Republican and he lobbied for this bill his office has also moved to make it easier for jail inmates to but\nI certainly believe in\nThe opportunity to to serve your time and then go forward or to repent and change a and you know I think that's what most of us hope uh we do a as we make mistakes as what we should hope for others [noise]\nFor Williams some of this has to do with his Mormon faith certainly that shapes my values and um you know as we work to garner support for it from folks that might\nNot normally be opposed we didn't talk about the ability of that redemption that ability to come back to the phones [noise]\n\nRedemption was also an important idea for state senator Kevin ... Republican from Loveland he co sponsored the bill that passed the state legislature earlier this year it was actually one of his last accomplishments as a lawmaker he's term limited and won't be back at the start of the next session\nBut so can I say center ... that I can still say that\nRight up until the next uh uh the the the next assembly is actually seated\nYummy I connected with one bird from his home studio in and out to all Colorado lawmakers if you want some good will with radio reporters have a home studio\nI Believe that to anybody who goes to the prison system has a lot of strikes against them coming out of the system and I mean we loaded up with with so many barriers to bringing people back into being functioning\nCitizens licenses that you cannot obtain if you have a\nFelony on your record for example or hiring obstacles as well yes I Believe in personal responsibility but I don't believe the government should be putting on a national obstacles for that individual to get\nBack into society\nThis is not a big element of that but it is a component to put people back on their feet [noise]\nWhat do you hope that this says to someone and they're getting out of prison when they meet with their parole officer and they her about\nPre registration say and regaining the right to vote what do you hope that says to someone who would soon be completing a criminal sentence\nOr two things come to my mind one I use the term redemption which I think it helps them recognized that they have paid their debt\nSecondly however you should give them that sense of responsibility which is essential for us to you know do the right thing when we are living in this uh this this land a freedom\n... what do you mean that it gives the former prisoner that sense of response\nYeah it's it's one of those components a of a living a good life if you will to to understand that you have a responsibility to look after the interests of everyone through your voting privileges or or a rights\nAnd it's it's not everything but it is one component\nFor giving people the proper motivation to do the right thing in their lives I you know again I don't think it's the it's the cure all but I Believe it's a it's the right\nStatement that we make to that person coming out of the prison system okay you're done you're now citizen again and we're going to help you get back on your feet by helping you I'm a registered to vote\nHow have you talked about this bill with other members of your party I mean have you said the same things we've been talking about about redemption and and making sure that people understand rights that currently exist what have you said to get them on your side well\nTo me an important component is\nThat to this is not a first step towards giving a convicted felon in prison voting\nRights because in Colorado if you're convicted of a felony while you're serving your sentence and that means either imprisoned or on parole\nYou do not have the voting rights of a citizen that is a part of your penalty for having committed a felony or the state of Colorado I Believe that that's an appropriate points\nThat should be kept in place and if if we wanted to change that I think we need to put it within the whole context of okay we are now reducing the penalty for every crime in the state of Colorado is that really what were intending to do here\nThere are again only two states that never remove someone\nVoting rights after a criminal conviction in Maine and Vermont people in prison on a felony charge in vote Justin Cooper the activists from the top of this episode wants to see Colorado move in that direction\nColorado has an opportunity to lean towards that full reign franchise men I'm a restoration of all rights right as it relates to voting\nSee we'll ... we'll hope to get there I think it's an opportunity for Colorado I'm to be a leader in that in that sense disliked Vermont writer Maine\nWhich means that truth this moment of bipartisan ... around felon voting rights to be a fleeting thing in Colorado so far it's focused on helping people understand when they regained their voting rights a future fight could be about something much bigger\nWhether they should ever lose that right in the first place\nCPR Sam brash on the effort to make sure everyone who can vote gets the chance to next time Sam explores voted in voting security to make sure ballots get counted and that hackers\nAre kept at ... you can subscribe to ... wherever you get your podcasts and you can hear it Mondays through

been another nice day around Denver but some changes are in the forecast tomorrow good evening you're listening to Colorado Public radio news I'm ...\nOvernight lows around forty for Denver tonight

counselor\nColorado Public radio is an important part of our lives every day CPR services represent a valuable source of news cultural information in the classical music services are also very important to us\nTo make similar issue\nBecause it's just a few hundred and just last month the lawyer sponsored her brother because of what's going on trying to find ... orders I Want to bring them up to your politically ... union guy but\nWhat I don't know right I think we can do to to make it gel people still want to come you don't wanna work that's what I'm not say\nMoscow might thank you very much for for calling into America on the line I mean the frustration that you hear in my voice is frustration that I Am sure is shared\nBy ... by millions of Americans who are frustrated by the immigration system that Congress in a bipartisan manner was working very hard to get a comprehensive immigration bill to the president's desk after he said in the Roosevelt Room that he wanted a\nQuote bill of love and then turned around and kill kill kill the bill Doug how can Congress and how can an immigration reform bill\nEver come out of Congress and certainly with this president in the White House\nWill ensure Jonathan I don't think you can um I spent two and a half years working as you know I'm for house would you then house majority leader Eric Cantor where immigration was a big part of them worked on and um he talked a lot about starting with the kids folks who were brought here young people were brought here through no fault of their own\nUm and how do we make sure that they're taking care of and and treated with dignity and respect\nUm he lost his primary in part because of that more there's more to it than that but I remember being at the Republican a house conference meeting in January twenty fourteen where the house leadership with Ken or banner Katherine marsh Rogers and Kevin McCarthy ... laid out what we wanted our immigration principles to be and as soon as that meeting was over\nThe conversation on immigration moving in the house was over so I I'm very much of a pass a pessimist on this unless Donald Trump waves and cuts the deal and I think on a lot of issues Donald Trump because of in fact\nUm some of the caustic rhetoric that he's made is in a unique position to cut the deal that uh maybe a President Bush for president Rubio meeting president Jeb Bush where president Rubio were Scott Walker wouldn't have been allowed to do by the Republican base I think that's true and guns as well\nBecause I I think the fundamental differences Donald Trump and Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon has a very specific white national vision for this country and so when they think about immigration people from Trinidad are not welcome here under Donald Trump's America\nYou know I think he's been very clear that the types of countries that he wants to see immigrants come from and they are not countries from the Caribbean or Africa or South America or Asia He wants to Europe and he wants his quote unquote good genes from Germany and so if ...\nYou know that's over the line I'm Still on the line or not your average ... not to ride the law and said that if I got to go down how was that over the line if I'm going to the President Jonathan\nThis is what we have to deal with us conservatives when we hear so much about civility but\nWe hear ... from job to do it easily ... she'll join us ... and just way find participate in the dead and think about what your party is doing to families from Latin America every single day so you can sit here and talk about the valley but I'm quoting your president who talks about his good genes okay Chrissie\n... Cristina dug one of the things when we went through the whole as whole country's\nControversy was that part of the reporting that came out of a ... out of that meeting was that he said why are we getting people from say Norway so it is it is part of the conversation Doug it's not it's not as Jonathan to hear\nHow it is and I say this was somebody has been pretty posed a lot of what Donald Trump ... uh come onto a program like this and I just have to hear the ... the United states would disagree with a lot\n... a little bit bigger than a racist over and over and over again that's not going to progress any conversation in this country forward if that's if that's the rhetoric that is going to be and then again it's my side that's not civil as my senators are being thrown out of restaurants and things like that how's the country are going to move forward it's not serious and I'm not going to participate in\nThe country might move forward if we actually try and be a little more inclusive to everyone who isn't yeah I I wouldn't want it on that I Would agree on that and then I Would say that starts with you as well yeah well you know we're all trying but I think the real problem is that this particular president has a very specific vision and what he wanted to get in there in Asian\nChristina and Doug you guys are are done in the thirty seconds that we have let Maria do you have anything to add in twenties I\nYeah I think ... you know what happened here I think just demonstrates how divisive or our country has become and you know I Do agree with Christine that President Trump has been at the helm and he has actually been to one\nTo really injected a lot of this divisiveness and has a weaponized it and use that as a political up fear mongering talk and I and with ...\nWe're going to have to leave it there duck Hi thank you very much Christina Greer thank you very much rarer donor thank you and thanks to all of you for listening joined us again tomorrow night for America on the line\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support is provided by the end he Casey foundation and New York public radio trustee Dr Mary White\n\nYou're listening to Casey afar FM Denver Casey of the a and Boulder an HD and maybe point one FM Casey of sees also heard on trends that are ... tonight to GW in Boulder at one of six twenty three\nThis is Colorado Public radio news [noise]\n[noise]\nColorado Public radio news helps deep and your understanding of issues important to everyone in our state CPR news dot org CPR news producer stories on topics such as healthcare energy state government and more and to help make sense of these issues you'll find interactive\nDigital feature graphics and photos [noise] see how CPR news reporting goes deeper with digital content that's CPR news dot org [noise]\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross Smith fresh air today Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me as a biographer turn literary forge or\nWe'll talk about growing up on a farm her early comedy at her breakout role and bridesmaids and playing Trump's former press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live she was initially skeptical she could look like him\nTo really lovely um special effects guy there just said oh yeah I think it'd be hard at all that will take like a half an hour which I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man that really was it\nAlso John Powers reviews the BBC series bodyguard which premiered in the u._k. in August and became one of the biggest hits of the decade it drops on Netflix Wednesday that's on fresh air [noise]\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington ...

I it's strange to hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was kind of true to form so rattling I always wanted to\nKnow whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you it's that decided to life folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nNo might know I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that than a million years um my friend Ken sublet that's I'm\nOne of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh he called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do impersonation is I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheel house\nAnd he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know just come in and can I can I send you to read [noise]\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely a special effects guy there just said oh yeah those are going to be hard at all that will take like a half an hour which I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a\nMan that really was it and they got it down to like\nYou know at one point we were doing it in my view Fifteen minutes but it was just thought to I think I got to feel it I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold\nHold the mirror up and to see if anyone realizes how kind of ridiculous there'd be\nSo one of the things that that you became famous for within that catches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal shooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe kind of fell into the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of segue podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rigs so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nAnd it was weird there were just you know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you could I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of ... against the glass and I thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\nMm\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] um\nNo\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter]\nWhen the ride on the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um\nYou know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink and your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross and I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene\nBecause part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross that comedy\nJust as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay ... none of us felt\nThat way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristle about it and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny [noise]\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny in kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen they said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my gosh look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] within ... okay some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes your sons really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[noise] most of my coffee at what point did you start thinking about either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy by coming in and stand up\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue I hadn't living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I'd moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh\nHad a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nThat night he found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day because\nNot necessarily talked about stand up but I think\nI kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found it fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I figure you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but it was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise]\nAnd then I did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm going to go this direction\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\nI Do strange I'm sure it was terrible uh I was at standup New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and you know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nMetallic kind of trench coat dress and and I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so you get hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they went harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself and my complimenting myself and then when they started to laugh I just thought oh it's really fun\nThis is really strange and fun and\nSuch a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it was in\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged\nAnd he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how did you joke so I just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on this myth why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous and more bold and brazen and I would not go in just plop down on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that\nToo we do always dress the way you describe a\nI was always completely completely ... in a different I was always in a huge way to some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and\nGo do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're Glenn may swing taper some kind of scuba ... thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous in and fun and I just thought well why not\nAnd if you get to wear like a scuba address out let's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called can you ever forgive me we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\n\n\n\n\n\n... comes from this station and from Iraq more than five\nHundred tire models from twenty to manufacturers and an online tool for finding tires based on vehicle meet budget and

banking retirement\nLearn more T. I. A.\nDot or this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise]\nYou know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer than probably better than I did I didn't um [noise] when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there was this element there was always one\nWho is one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nTop off [laughter] and you're just like what like what\nDoes that ever worked for you has any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stop talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more at work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about\nAre you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road of like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she is a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to have core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's\nThe first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching ... times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men\nOne of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was huge distinguishing between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind us what the differences in your mind\nBlack people okay [laughter] [laughter] and black people\nUm I think it's also the difference between a him and a negro spiritual progress you know you get to saying the same song but even if if you are doing a no like oh and then you have some other ...\nThose\nOther notes that are being sung or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from\nSo that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say a sustained on it but it's a step on it you know you're putting that heart and it is coming from some place deep in your soul that you are getting out and and\nJust wanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's a nigger oh spiritual [noise] well speaking of\nOf pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the self ah for this book and then one of the stops you made was a mother Emanuel one of\nThe oldest black congregation from itself it was the churches hundred Ninety next birthday but this was also as so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on worshipers just over three years ago and and just an immense tragedy for for our whole country what what was that experience like\nWe had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um we decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina and they were having a celebration\nAnd it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way [laughter]\nWay because you're like a ... of the famous celebrity chef that right now I see I didn't care but the matrix that kids so it was like I'm trying to get this really pass food\nDone and you all are in the way um but they had all of these pots going in and then just this huge\nKitchen and there's a hierarchy that happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting this food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a task\nTo other people and it is serious\nIt was really beautiful it was it was about the congregation coming together and there was a tragedy but there was also you knew that they had each other and that anybody who came into that church that day was part of that family and it was just a beautiful thing [noise]\nWell one more recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about some hot water corn bread so this is not your average corn bread Carla this is something different right\nIt is not your average corn bread if you're not from the south okay [laughter]\nPeople themselves you know exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly have much of corn bread and loved it but hot water or having a sort of what what ... what what would I be doing with it if I tried to make this\nHot water cornbread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder\nAnd the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember my grandmother's fingers being in those patio so she would make a little over one's my mother and makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it in that\nBut I mean seriously it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot of the the larger things that you were learning about yourself through this project\nI must say that this was a personal journey with this book\nI set out to tell this story so that African Americans could appreciate the food more and people outside of the community can understand what it is and\nAnd sort of maybe be inspired to not only cook this food but also to look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines\nMore I realized I was carrying a a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and what it is but I had a chip on my shoulder into it come out sideways and it and you know\nUh and now it is just a love for this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines ... love talking to your thank you for for coming back on best of luck with the book thank you so much as it's been such a pleasure [noise]\nThe book\nIs called Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep\n\n...

national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty\nThe Nineteen eighty seven I N ... treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the\nBut you mentioned it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John wolf style is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around to is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are not only or the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on a national security council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority\nOr goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump and President Obama\nAs President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple ... and the government is very happy to go along and pursue that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think John ... is going to say today\n[noise] I think John ... going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand and two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interests because you cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever missiles we want you guys will just have to play catch up\nUm and I think as we've seen a lot of reporting is more than capable not only playing catch up a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nIt there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place between the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states\nAnd it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons I'm from the ministry says ... office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me\nBut if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows or even more than it has a and we will be likely having to increase our own spending a and our own nuclear deployments\nJohn ... of the nuclear crisis strip

helped put to rest attacks Republican mattered about his leadership during hurricane her mean two years ago\nIn his campaign speeches Gillum outlines a series of mainstream democratic and progressive proposals he wants to expand Medicaid under the Affordable CARE Act he wants to increase the starting salary for teachers to fifty thousand dollars and he wants to almost double the minimum wage in Florida to Fifteen dollars an hour\nEvery body I don't want to earn enough where they can take care of themselves and their family and maybe take a vacation when we get out of a year and that shouldn't be too much to ask and the fate of lord\nIf Gillum when he'd be Florida's first black governor and published act says she likes scones progressive ideas his humility and his charisma his

deal\nRace has been part of the campaign however talking about the state economy in August Republican Congressman Ron dissenters said voters shouldn't monkey this up by electing Gillum a comment many

all the difference the president's endorsement and his appearance at a rally with descent as in Tampa help boost the former congressman to an easy win in the primary\nSince then decided says concentrated much of his campaign on attacking Gillum in his speeches dissenters calls Gillum a socialist an unfounded label Gillum rejects another line of attack by descent this has more substance\nAnd I'm the only one of the two of us who can credibly say he's not under FBI investigation for corruption or the FBI\nIs investigating city contracts with developers in Tallahassee

missile a weapon that can fly faster and farther than almost\nAnything in existence NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the latest these weapons are called hyper sonic weapons and they are fast really fast by definition they travel at least five times the speed of sound thousands of miles per hour\nThe air force is currently developing hyper sonic weapons including at a place called wind tunnel number not just outside of Washington DC well they did what in\nThe morning I showed up dam Mariner who's in charge that the test they were running that they were classified I wasn't going to get inside no not at this point but I was allowed in the lobby of the wind tunnel building [noise]\nTheir marriage showed me unclassified version of\nThe things they work on so if you look on this table here we have several of the shapes that we've tested in the wind among the models as a sleek silver wed with the spine down to center is called a wave rider and so it's a fancy way to say rides on its own shock wave\nHere's how the wave rider works the wedge shaped warhead would be put on top of a rocket and fired at enormous speeds to the very edge of space than it would detach from the rocket and glad to its target\nNope big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes\nBut those missiles just going to straight line\nFrom launched to target this vehicle would not only be able to come from space but people to turn and bank and and the fly almost like a real airplane and\nThat's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China and Russia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down their ballistic missiles with missile defense hyper sonic weapon can swerve or take a roundabout route to the target will still going incredibly fast it's essentially unstoppable [noise]\nBack in August China tested a high percentage prototype the flu for more than five minutes it reached beads above four thousand miles per hour according\nTo state media Russia to has been testing and the missile defense roundtable last month the Pentagon's head of

stepping up to ... percent of extra search now there are still some big technical challenges to building these weapons pushing through the air it five or six times the speed of sound generates a lot of friction and friction means heat it hyper sonic speed steel turns sauce like butter\nIn fact the Airforce tried to build high percentage airplanes into the Nineteen sixties but they kept melting\nForm of protection committing torture like hyper some years suddenly Parsons eventual too\nThat's an archival Airforce video showing how one experimental aircraft the ex Fifteen almost burned

states and China will conduct I just want to test many of those tests certainly not all of them being successful\nActing also says that ... percent of weapons pose a real threat to the U.S military but he says the solution isn't necessarily to develop our own hyper sonic weapons in response\nI don't think we should develop pipe is only just because somebody else is doing that ... I think we should do the type of sonics iffy so specific millet treat problems or feel specific military needs\nFor now the U.S is stepping up testing and back when title nine they're ready\nTo start game on a great game uh as I said I Can't see anything but Mirren has come up with a solution I can stand out back behind the tunnel and record the rush of errors it moves through the system mock ten

what they call the people's vote on Brexit here's a London Mayor Sadiq Khan but at the Associated Press\nOr saying is that some of the problems is she is about the ... the nobody was talking about vice president Joe nobody was talking about no deal whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete breakfast is in some political danger members of Theresa May's own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some of the opposition Labour Party to defend her here's ... who's the shadow breakfast administer\nSome of the corps of comments about farmers to this weekend attributed to conservative than the former ministers are nothing short of discourse [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank I'm ordering hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave you\nKnow it's interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says nine to five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge it's we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Arlen matches up you know part of the EU and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news is it's very hard language isn't really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom\nUm but the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a and other election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain Lauren independence from that you you're but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned who went out and protest it for A People's vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWhat they were talking about there is here with here that they basically says they say you know two thousand sixteen when this ... was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations or what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan that's heading for the United states\nThere are dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras\nAnd these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR but he's not as big an event as news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry\nBut remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of this symbolic use being made these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelm the states he kept the caravan and the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\nWater bottle of Honduras El Salvador that made a lot of money every year we give a far as they did not say for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid and some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know by your faith rather than through here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nWhat makes the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to ah to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states in the first by\nAnd the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided about eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to rich Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief\nHistory the economic and it's already dark avoiding interconnected starts very much and the answer to the United states you see the devaluing happened\nHere that violence here because it's\nPushing people in the Georgian irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly bind if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody has to obey whoa how about the president obeying the empowerment Control Act which prohibits the president from with story or pounding buddy appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this says James Robertson former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nThird dozens of programs in the three countries and they they could have been reviewed not all of them are effective manner you're too small or to make a long term difference it's often difficult to measure them\nWhile Robert would liked a thorough review he points out that it takes time and needs to be coordinated with Congress he also argues that it is in us interest to help these countries boost security and economic opportunities for people in the region to keep them home\nIt cannot begin to solve all the problems of the country so they have to be from private sector investment it is a very small piece of the puzzle\nThe state department won't say whether it has received orders from the White House to cut aid officials ad that they believe Central American governments are discouraging their citizens from taking the dangerous journey north Michele ...

that people feel to the polar bear\nI also think the polar bear\nThis time of climate change\nOf who and what is affected you think people have made enough as a connection\nBecause there doesn't seem to be much of beating of climate change these days I don't know that\nThey've made enough of the connection but I think that it's a great example of a creature out there that really stands for climate change and that there's things that you can do anybody can do in order to affect helping them in the wild\nAll right she would get behind the scenes and see we go early and then I'd love to know what

the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so much time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that

treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens

us now from New York a morning on the\nMorning Noel so why did the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower order for the commerce secretary to testify for these lawsuits well\nThis is a request from the Trump Administration which has been arguing that these lawsuits should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already released by these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question how secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient\nThat there have been inconsistencies in a rough his testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question and the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the

[noise]\nHundreds of thousands of protesters in London last week demanded what they call the people's vote on Brexit here's a London Mayor Sadiq Khan for the Associated Press\nFor saying is that some of the problems you might see as go the ... the nobody was talking about ... fresher do nobody was talking about no deal whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete breakfast is in some political danger members of Theresa May's own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some of the opposition Labour Party to defend her here's ... who's the shadow breakfast administer\nSome of the corps of comments about farmers to this weekend attributed to conserve the son of former ministers are nothing short of discourse [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank I'm learning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave you\nKnow it's interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says nine to five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge it's we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches of you know part of the EU and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for a centrally not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was a talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language isn't really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom\nUm but the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a ... and other election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum may sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain more independence from that you you're but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned went out and protest and free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that\nBe well what they were talking about there is here with here that they basically says they say you know two thousand sixteen when this vote was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations are what British call a shambles and pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back because what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan that's heading for the United states\nThere are dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR but he's not as big an event as news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S\nIf they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of the symbolic use being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed by the states he kept the caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\nWater bottle on shelves south Georgia made a lot of money every year we have a far as I did not say for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid there was some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know you're safe for them to hear\nThat Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nBut just make the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to ah to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states is the first by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided about eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to ... Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nThey history the economic and it's already dark completely interconnected starts very much in the interest of the United states to see that developed an ... year that violence you reduce here because it's pushing people in situations of irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly bind if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody has to obey the law out about the president ... Control Act which prohibits the president from with jewelry or pounding muddy appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this says James Roberts of former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nWhere thousands of programs and the three countries and they they could've been reviewed not all of them are effective manner you're too small or to make a long term difference it's often difficult to measure them\nWhile Roberts would liked a thorough review he points out that it takes time and needs to be coordinated with Congress he also argues that it is in U.S interests to help these countries blue security and economic opportunities for people in the region to keep them home\nAnd cannot begin to solve all the problems of countries where there has to be from private sector caused embarrassment it is a very small piece of the puzzle\nThe state department won't say whether it has received orders from the White House to cut aid officials ad that they believe Central American governments are discouraging their citizens from taking the dangerous journey north Michele ...
