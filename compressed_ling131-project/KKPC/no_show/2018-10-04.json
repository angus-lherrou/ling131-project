of judge Brett Kavanaugh who wrote a letter in support of the Supreme Court nominee in August\nAnd now says he has changed his mind mark ... within the law school class of Nineteen Ninety along with Kavanaugh and he joins us now welcome to the program they keep her having me when you think back to the late eighties when you have an hour in law school together what stands out to you\nWell it was an intense experience such a small class of about a hundred and sixty people at that time at Yale Law we knew each other pretty well and uh the classroom experience and the social experience were both among the most intense of my life\nWhat was Kevin all like back in law school when you were students together\nWhen we were in law school a rat was like most people he was young energetic smart somebody that was interesting to talk to and hang around with a I never and this is important to say I never saw any of the behavior or anything like what's been alleged and I never heard stories about that\nYou're a Democrat what factored into your decision to sign a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee along with twenty two other classmates endorsing Kevin ... over the summer\nI Am a Democrat however my side lost an election you know I'm certainly aware that Brett Kavanaugh does not agree with me on a number of legal and political issues but having lost an election the other side was not going to nominate somebody that I Would have chosen in that way\nAnd so you have to look at qualifications you have to look at experience and so I knew from my own experience with Brett that he was somebody that I liked but I called some people practice in front of the court that a court of appeals for the district of Columbia\nAnd they explained that he was a fair judge somebody who hire good clerks and real good opinions\nAnd so in part based on that I signed the letter\nAnd then what was it about last Thursday's hearing that prompted you to send a second letter just yesterday to the Senate Judiciary committee withdrawing or support\nI think it really has to do not so much with the allegations of Dr for given that we're still waiting for the FBI to report on that it has to do with the exchange he had with the senators which is a co equal branch of government\nAnd having civil discourse with the quote unquote branches of government is something that we have to expect from the Supreme Court\nIn particular it was the exchange with my own senator Amy club which are wrecked Kevin uh started by recognizing his ah that he liked her that he had my work but then when she asked hard question he responded by throwing the question back at her\nThis was a question about his drinking\nThat's correct and he done that before with Senator Whitehouse or perhaps one other senator in ... there was something about that that was like a gut punch you know it was it was it was really disappointing no he did come back and apologize for that at least to center cobra char but that's something that is very hard to get over\nWhy do you consider that disqualifying\nLike I said because there are a expectations of the Supreme Court that they have to treat with respect to co equal branch of government they can't as we often hear irrigate the power to themselves and if he's going in with that kind of contempt ... equal branch it's deeply troubling\nI Know that you've been in touch with other classmates do you feel that your representative or more of an outlier\nI'm an outlier in two ways I mean I was outlier for signing the letter in the first place it was only twenty three out of the\nHundred and sixty some members of the class who signed it and the first place so that may be an outlier in certainly an outlier on with my Proctor and withdrawing from the letter [noise] um so it's it's only the two of us are among settled group who who did both things\nDo you still consider him a friend [noise] yes I I I Hope that we can have a friendship I'm I suspect he might be screened in my calls right now but uh I Hope not\nMark all sorts of Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor author now teaches law at the University of St Thomas in Saint Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so I'm prepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children nor did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also said yeah we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures didn't Nielsen\nIt is important is Jeanette that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da jazz held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assistant after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nIs no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds\nYou'd find any child in our care for any parent HGH asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the H. S. said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does it is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nVHS does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Joe you're walking [noise]\nAn even go to the point was one of the officials at the embassy\nSuggested that if this debate ones that had the u._k. might get less favorable traits

important reasons why China wants to frame it's global image measures that China scholar at Oxford University one\nOf the context for the obsessive way in which Chinese officials can sometimes think about the way that China is portrayed overseas is the fact that for the best part of a hundred and fifty years China was of course not in control of its own destiny\nIt was a period when foreign powers carved up China which the government calls the century of humiliation the government's reason economic boom changed all that\nThese days ... much better position to actually spread that narrative talk about itself in those terms\nWith we might say much louder make offended and that is creating some cognitive dissonance I thing for some parts of the American establishment which maybe for a long time so that democracy was not the only way that China could go but the only way that any country could possibly go\nNow Chinese President Xi Jinping has gone further than past leaders

happens when planets collide she uses to actual cannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\n\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's clash of MacArthur fellows many let's call it the genius grant for years experts have thought the earth's moon formed after a large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming up through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates are amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed [noise]\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became in the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always

right in part because\nThe global economy is built on sort of global outsourcing trade model\nAnd again especially when it comes to technology China is a huge player in that\nAnd the implications of this are companies now have to think well do I have to worry about what's being put in the technology that's being manufactured how do I try and counter that is it should I go someplace else and make things I mean it's a it's a really big hard issue to solve\nA for a lot of companies a lot of companies the reason they operate and as cheaply and can sell products is the place they can is because

viewing one copy of the FBI's report on sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe reporters confidential and reactions have been divided Democrats called incomplete Republicans say it was Thoreau a final vote on Kavanaugh could take place within forty eight hours and there are just a few undecided senators for more on that we are joined by NPR's\nKelsey Snell like health care as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be comforting for a lot of Republicans and Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for half an hour after hour briefing this morning he talked with some of us during the day after you're heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabinet and he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who was a huge Kavanaugh supporter before he says if anything this report made him feel stronger about that to park here's what he had\nAnd I think after all this is a stronger in terms of understanding the facts are looking for and I am ready to vote\nBut what about those three undecided senators we've been talking about all week what have you heard from them\nYeah we're focused still on Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona those three Republicans are really critical here because he has mostly been ducking reporter and she's gone in and out reading that report for much of the day\nOr there's like Susan Collins of Maine and flake they say you know they haven't said exactly how they're not but they both say they found this report helpful Collins called a thorough and flake who is one of the people who actually\nOld for this investigation he told reporters he thought it was Thoreau as well and he says he hasn't seen any new corroborating evidence which is the thing that he said before he Libya yes if that was the case if there wasn't that corroborating evidence that would be found\nThere were still kind of reading the tea leaves on how they're going to vote what about the contents of this report how much we learned about what's in it\nHonestly virtually nothing because they can't tell us anything it is confidential it has left behind those closed doors in sub basement as the capital\nAnd we what we do know is that it's about forty five pages and they spoke to about nine people and NPR's confirm the names of six of them and most of those people are friends of cabin on forward from high school they also spoke with Deborah Ramirez who was a classmate at Yale\nAnd she's the one who she is having a drunken Lee exposing himself to her in the early to mid eighties\nSo like I said there's that one copy and the senators are just circulating through and telling us that and you know that these are mostly interviews and I'm a transcription and some of the conversations that they had we also know that Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed so they are not a part of this and denser pretty upset about that\nSo senators now have to report the Senate majority leader has said he wants to vote in the next forty eight hours what happens in that time\nUh sometime likely tomorrow morning there will be a procedural vote\nThat is necessary for them to move on they need fifty one votes to pass that and that makes this a really key tests because fifty one of those does all it takes to prove his confirmation when that coming up so if they can get to the fifty one votes now it's very likely they'll be able to get to it and wants to find a book comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their mind after procedurals like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final though comes about thirty hours later ... sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed the Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats in great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this and energize them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a lot harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that you need to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota All right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if God had an gets confirmed some will we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much shame\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey note there the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat when Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants to sell Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath\nI asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone the did then told me what exactly to do first and then tailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former regard as had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the character spaces of bailout\nSo you filled out the form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called buck a way to buy my food by my computer are hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all the other one should learn from the view so usually committee or what is taking the oath and what is also trying out in this case it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being on aware of the phrases black you know I think Britain moved confused that was passing out but the black Neal cruise means doing things that you don't know if you've done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the student who talked occasionally frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered to this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I speak to what I Know about race nudey three really forty five year old college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think that deliver a thorough job in that sense at all", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "04"}
