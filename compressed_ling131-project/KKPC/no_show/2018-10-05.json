matters from CPR news\nUm so we can estimate how many building foundations or on it so it's an incredibly large site but we don't know whether it was all occupied at one time\nIt's going to take decades of research\nTo to unravel that so what you know one of the things that I've been saying is that\nWhen I moved goes occupied it had about as many building foundations as there are on the island and Manhattan but of course on Manhattan loose building foundations are skyscrapers and ... and we'll go through the houses of ordinary people you know they might be a couple of ...\nBy a couple of meters on shot so you know and and of course that the maximum population of either move into if everything was occupied at one time which it probably wasn't about two hundred thousand people on the island of Manhattan you have upwards of you know at one point five one point six million people\nSo you know when I when I make that comparison and and that can in person came out in an article that was in the guardian and it got picked up in the media and in Latin America\nYou know the idea is to just get people thinking about urbanism what that actually means and what you know prehistoric urbanism means versus modern urbanism and um you know what what an amazing process it actually is\n... and ... was not well known until just recently right\nYeah so you know doing performing traditional archaeological survey which was basically technology that goes back to World War one you have a you know it's up there with\n... you know new GPS units and stuff but it's basically the same technology we have a a group of trained a researchers walk across the landscape and a line in a transect record everything that they find over the course of doing that in two thousand nine we discovered on the winter\nWhich is the city that is on a geologically speaking very recent lava flow it's on top of lava flow\nAnd you know we we started serving this place walking across a group of graduate students and one day they were like Chris we need we got to find an edge you know we need to know what we're dealing with so I grabbed a couple of those fires in a bottle of water and I walked across this land for him and I walked for about two kilometers\nI got to the other side and it was like oh they're buildings all the way across oh this is a city and then I was like oh no it's a city [laughter]\nAnd here's the rest of my life's work we we have just about a minute left sure as\nChris Fisher um you've mentioned lidar earlier this technology that really allows you to get a

hundreds of other scientists are earth is changing dramatically\nAnd we have a very limited window in in in which to record the earth as it is now for future generations so that they can understand it scientifically so here at CDC we're promoting the acquisition of massive lidar records for threatened starting first and threatened areas\nTo permanently recorded the earth as it exists now so that people you know centuries from now and go back look through these records with tools that are much more sophisticated and we have now\nAnd you know help them understand how the earth is changing in in

[laughter] I Love I Love actually why ... why do I have a okay I hear a law yeah oh okay well\nSo are you are running for for office in Hawaii or on the Democratic ticket what about being a teacher in your state has made you run for office\nYou know I think that what I'd like to add to that conversation is I think that all of our experiences as teachers\nCome not just from the classroom but I'm not just from these immediate struggles that were engaged in over funding\nOf our public schools but I'm also I Would say two decades of politicization of teachers around the education\nThe formula looking at rates so I'm standardization over emphasis on test scores um then moved to ... charter as a public school system I think all of these have had an impact on our public schools in some states more than others say the overall effect\nHas done to politicize teacher then I think that what you're saying nationally is\nA reflection of that so now teachers are willing to enter electoral politics because um it it does seem that our legislators don't clearly understand the challenges that [noise] that um we're facing that is in the classroom but system wide\nPublic school or a Amy we're running out of time but I Want to ask you one more question how will you deal with not being in class teaching students if you win\nWell I I if I win a ... um and then go back to teaching but um I I think that I Do plan to be I'm deeply engaged in civic education in the state so I Want to continue that engagement with\nYoung people around the the these questions that politics and power and public education\nAmy ... calling in from Hawaii thank you very much for for calling into America on the line thank you\nSo given a we we've heard from Amy Joe Becky Michael only Becky was well I should say back he was the only Republican I'm ... that we had um\nGotten colon who called in or the local GOP organizers I'm taking candidates like Becky a seriously in this new teacher movement that's happening around the country\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think so I think to a certain extent that varies from state to state uh and to a certain extent the partisanship of these movements has varied from state to state I Would say in Arizona into a certain extent in Kansas and Oklahoma it's probably a little bit more tied in with the Democratic party\nUm in places like Kentucky and West Virginia it hasn't been as much um there's definitely been also some inter Republican clashes over this Kansas was really where this movement first started um in sort of\nA revolt to the cuts imposed after\nA San Brownback former governor of that state passed these sweeping tax cuts that ended up really just guarding the state's budget and um there were some intro Republican fight between moderates and conservatives over the support of the tax cuts there were a few primaries were bought or tried to us conservatives or vice versa\nSome of the people involved in that were teacher candidates and so I think Republicans realized that teachers even though teachers' unions are typically associated with Democrats\nUm teachers have a background that appeals to everyone including Republican primary\nVoters and I should point out that the four super colors that we had called in running for office the teachers they're all running a four state Senate\nOr in their in their states\nWill just wondering and the little time that we have left we talked to two candidates for state Senate but is this teacher movement I'm going on the national level do we have teachers running for Congress\nSo you haven't seen as much of that\nYou have seen this teacher movement impact a number of state wide races\nOr for example the teacher movement has really a good chunk of the reason the Oklahoma gubernatorial races actually competitive um there's an attorney general they're a former attorney general Democrat named drew Edmondson who's making a real run up that race despite being a Democrat\nHe's doing well enough of the Republican Governors Association is going up as a tack ads against him you've also seen a West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin use his support for the teacher walkouts they're as sort of a talking point I'm for his own reelection he released an ad talking about why he supported the walk out in his opponent\nDid not well Kevin rubber learned from ... post

...\nSay they've already plans in anticipation of the jury verdict Cheryl Corley NPR News Chicago\nIt was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they've done was they'd allowed an academic research or to use some of the data\nOn the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold that data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door\nOr has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company today\nAnd you're right that the executive within Facebook Sandy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games what did he find\nWhat he found unnerved him a Sandy Park illicit joined Facebook in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused and anyway we're\nYou know where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that\nData that they didn't really want to discover the full reach a and and Sandy Park hill is left\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be prophetic because exactly the kind of undisciplined user data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally\nOr turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing it response of\nYes exactly as he said that you know I needed people I needed engineers to help me try to police where this data was going with all of the resources we're going to grow he said at some point\nAnd he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their ears they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was say\nWhat are some of the other things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they began to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like a auto play video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that at and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it\nAnd they did other things they for instance you know you remember in the very beginning Facebook used to have pages single pages you'd have to click onto the next page they got rid of that so it's just a continuous scroll\nAnd all of these little tiny details um\nWe're in a way making Facebook into a new generation of behavioral experts they figured out how to you tweak people's vanities and their passions and their susceptibility and their desires in order to keep them on the site the most important thing Facebook could do\nAnd this is how they measured it was made sure that people were\n... were signing on and staying on whenever you joined the company in your orientation you were taught about something very important metric known as el six or seven\nWhich means the number of people who've logged in six of the last seven days and whatever you could do to try to raise that el six or seven that was the priority [noise]\nUm but as you know somebody put it to me\nThe problem with that is that eventually you exhaust the positive ways of boosting that engagement\nAnd eventually you start to look at what this person described as the dark patterns the ways that you can use anxiety or vanity or to try to get people to sign on one of the things they discovered for instance was if you send somebody an email that says\nThat Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important to the growth and Facebook\nHave an ... is a staff writer for the New Yorker we'll talk some more after a short break this is fresh air\n\nI'm\n\n[noise] you\n\n\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Evan ... he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about Martin Zucker burg and Facebook and its current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook has done a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors they'll give us an example\n[noise] this is a big change for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who was Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he'd become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong with our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call external and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decreased sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they're trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is unemployed shovel and the company has been done to acknowledge it you heard for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling would glazed dies hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you\nAnd so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that any more\nYou talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that is he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he hasn't in some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world\nI'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize them at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nOvernight it takes a process you have to build out these systems in order to allow artificial intelligence to detect hate speech and then hire the kinds of people who can\nWho can solve the problem he ... he said that they are going to have over a hundred people a Burmese speakers who are going to be policing um the ah Facebook in Myanmar but I think it speaks to a broader\nA broader dynamic at work here with which is that for a long time as one of marks afterwards friends said to me when there were complaints about the company\nHe either thought that these were just LED lights these were people who are slow to embrace technology or in other cases they were exaggerating are overstating the role that Facebook was playing he looked at a place like me and mine said well they were probably going to be fighting anyway I'm I'm putting words in his mouth or does or not words he said to me\nBut I think over time he has come to this realization and by his own description of belated realization that Facebook is not just a tool on the table is not just an of a new implement it is in fact a fundamental and very ... you know by its nature it has\nTo be responsible for the forces that he'd on leashes\nUm but then building the systems to try to get control of this is is hard and they have moved much more slowly than they should have a in some cases by their own admission\nLet's talk about the twenty sixteen elections did Facebook was when the election was approaching see this as a big revenue opportunity\nThey did they saw this as a an important moment they Sheryl Sandberg and call with investors and analysts\nCompared it to the world cup or the super bowl with a cave operating officer of you know she is yeah she's sort of arguably the second most powerful person at Facebook and\nAnd and what she said was this was going to be a major opportunity for them to sell ads a political ads the projections at the time were that\nAs candidates and political organizations became more aware of the importance of the Internet that they were going to shift a lot of their spending from television into the Internet and that that you were going to see a a nine or ten fold increase in how much spending was going to be available and Facebook want it to be a big recipient of that\nRight and and it hadn't gotten the special exemption 'em to print ads which didn't disclose who paid for them right so so that was kind of a wide open opportunity\nYeah Facebook had used its lobbying power it had\nUm it had argued to the federal election commission that it should be exempted from rules that require television advertising to be identified by the source of the funding you know that point at the end where they say who who paid for the they said we shouldn't have to follow those rules because we're in New technology and in their filings they said you don't want to stifle the growth of new\nInnovation but as a result that meant that he was in a sense a very dark terrain that things that were being posted on Facebook that were ads are around politics where in many cases of mysterious orange and it was very hard to know who was posting them and why\nAnd Facebook offered to embed a Facebook employee with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to help a campaign to use the platform effectively how did they respond\n[noise] for the Clinton campaign or rejected the offer 'em\nThey thought they had more or less enough of their own technical capability to do it but the Trump campaign embraced it eagerly they were a much smaller almost sort of shoestring operation they had very little uh of the season political expertise that was rallying around other presidential candidates\nAnd so Facebook moved employees into the Trump campaign headquarters and they helped them craft their messages they help them figure out how to reach the largest possible audience how to\nTest different messages many many messages a day um to figure out just what small differences changing the background color or changing the tax or the font\nHow that would impact the number of people that would click on it and ultimately might give money and support the candidate so later in the end when after Donald Trump won the election the senior campaign strategist were very clear as one of them Teresa hung said\nTo an interviewer without Facebook we would not have won they played an absolutely essential role in the process\nHow did the Trump campaign itself you use the platform to affect things like turn up\nBut one of the things they did was the Trump campaign bought an ad campaign on Facebook that was designed to suppress

incredibly powerful tools or persuasion that Facebook has which are really we have been engineered to to optimize to to get people to respond I'm\nIn the view of the Trump campaign that was an important piece of their success and they've talked about it ever since\nThey have an ... is a staff writer for the New Yorker we'll talk some more after a short break\nThis is fresh air\n\n\n\nUh

Yorker his piece about Martin Zucker Bergen Facebook ghost in the machine was in a recent issue of the magazine\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread of false information on Facebook or some of it by by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency and Russia um how did sucker bird respond to this [noise]\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might've affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how\nEfficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin had fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project\nAnd yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that uh from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's right um so the company was in big trouble ... Berg\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nWell there is a lot riding on that appearance ah you know in many ways that kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and there was growing calls for regulation and\nHe in some ways to vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point or an hacked senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave

investment and sophistication of these companies\nWere losing revenue another day just because of inflation without new federal money the cap of what we can do is there we are right now simply maintaining what we have\nSo Kevin below the national conference of state legislatures says while Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nAnd the last five years we've seen many states more than half of them actually enact legislation to increase funding for transportation\nSince two thousand and ten thirty three states have raised their own motor fuel taxes Missouri could join them next month the voters approve a ten cents a gallon gas tax hike and Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding\nIn many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise\nSome states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also we're down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with that Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time of ways to hike federal funding for transportation but there's almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation that same rhetoric named ... thinks the infrastructure we need to look at the answer is just a matter of paying for it but there's no substantive plant\nSo when it comes to congressional inaction on transportation funding and the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say it's deja vu all over again David Schaper NPR\nNews Chicago earlier this year Apple's chief financial officer said the company would buy back shares of stock one hundred billion dollars worth wow\nWhen you have a trillion dollar company you can do that this is part of a bigger trend of American companies engaging in stock buybacks to explain what exactly they are and why they're sometimes controversial returned or rain or counted Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money team\nBefore we get into the whole debate over buybacks we should explain what they are probably okay it's when a\nCompany decides it's going to buy its own stock and it finds that stocks from the people who own the stock from\nIts shareholders engender the company will pay its shareholders little premium for those shares so why do companies do this we put this question to John Cochran\nI'm a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford\nAnd I also have a blog grumpy economists\nAnd here's what grumpy John says about buybacks\nA company makes a lot of profits either 'cause they're you know apple and Facebook and money is pouring in the front door or the corporate tax cut increased above so so they got money sitting around\nYou're seeing a sign of our company will manage that they're not going to take this dream of profits and make crazy investments they don't automatic they're going to give it back to the owners\nSo they can give cash back to the owners AKA the company's shareholders which seems right I mean it's better than wasting the money nor talent you know is an economist at the Roosevelt Institute she says that when companies are giving all their extra cash to shareholders it means they're not investing more money in workers' she\nLooked specifically at Wal Mart could have done with the money it's planning to spend on buybacks and twenty Eighteen\nShe calculated it could've increased to pay as one million full time workers by about ten thousand dollars per year so when Wal Mart says they really can't afford to pay their workers so that families can live above the poverty line we have to look at what they're using their money for and say that that's simply not true\nBut John ... says companies are supposed to answer to their shareholders it's actually their duty is not their duty he says to benefit the wider economy\nThe point of the company has to make money on behalf of its shareholders\nThis does benefit workers because when a company is run efficiently it has to hire people and it has to make those people productive\nAnd in the end high productivity is higher wages are are beat up but I think it's a misunderstanding to think that the company makes money and then decides who to give presents to and maybe give presents to workers or maybe it gets presence to owners or maybe decides to give a bonus to the electric company just to be nice to them [noise] ah it's just not how it works\nSo well this debate has been happening by docs have grown by a lot\nBack in the early eighties ran rules around buybacks were relaxed by the Reagan Administration\nCompanies in essence ... five hundred we're spending about four percent of their profits on buybacks in the past few years Lenore says that's jumped to more than fifty percent it will be probably one trillion dollars spent on stock buybacks this year that's more than President Obama spent on the wrist\nThe very act and that's just in twenty Eighteen alone stock buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny from leaders on Wall street and even from lawmakers in fact a few months ago legislation was introduced Senate that would restrict stopped by back and take us right back to the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nRain echoing disadvantage Smith Planet Money\nSupport from

Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses\nThere is evidence that should have been pursued lead that should have been followed answers that should've been sawed and it has all the appearance of a white water\nHad let let me just ask you about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who writes ... who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR pursue leave after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly ascribe as to who they could interview and how long they add and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Kevin\nThat's incorrect so is that contention that there is no end of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in the interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific I witnessed than other\nLead that should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way a Connecticut constituent who had information that judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just contradicted and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there is some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there's solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here are two important points first of all this report should be made public\nSo you and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention now making can eat the border by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was disqualifying their self dating arrogant acrimonious\nThreatening demeanor that he brought to the court in many ways on math the judge and showed us the real man\nWill have to stop the conversation there is so much to say on some of

minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that\nThe final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow senators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers Congress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nThere are four key boats here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nOr let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're gonna try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear ah in their entirety over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from\nIs the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader of the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's\nFirst nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it as Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg has where this year and they know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their sides\nBut don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA marriage that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budget they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer [noise]\nAnd the Supreme Court justice\nHe has repeatedly misled the Senate about his involvement in some of the most serious controversies of the Bush administration\nIncluding warrantless wiretapping of American citizens our policy against torture the theft of electronic records from Democratic senators and his involvement in the nomination a very controversial judges faced with credible allegations of various types of misconduct\nJudge Kavanaugh's credibility was again tested and he continued to dissemble and even ... barricade about easily refuted facts\nBeyond the issue of credibility judge Kavanaugh presented to the Senate the bitter is the parties in testimony I have ever heard coming from a candidate seeking the Senate's approval whether they be for the bench or the executive branch\nNow there are many who thinks that what happened\nWhen judge Kavanaugh was Seventeen years old should not be this positive\nEven if you believe that\nHis actions at age fifty three in terms of demeanor\nPartisanship and above all credibility should be just positive judges at every level of the federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and morals character judges at every level should be judicious incredible and independent\nBut especially especially on the Supreme Court I Do not see how it's possible for my colleagues to say was perfect confidence that judge Kavanaugh has the temperament independence\nAnd credibility to serve on the United States Supreme court so I asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why judge Kavanaugh there is no dictate that you have to march blindly forward with a nominee\nWhen there are other is available to you\nThere are many judges\nWho I Am sure conservatives would be happy to have on the court I'd remind my colleagues the seat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to fill was held by a justice who assumed the bench after one nominee was voted down by the Senate and the second nominee withdrew his nomination\nBut the Republican majority has press forward blindly on judge Kavanaugh\nEven when brave women came forward to speak truth to power\nFor what cause for the sake of winning that's not reason enough my colleagues on the other side\nIf you have doubts about judge Kavanaugh's credibility about the ability to tell the truth about his ability to be impartial and nonpartisan\nNo matter what you think of his jurisprudence\nOr what he may or may not have done in high school and college you should not vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court so my friend Democrat and Republican for all the controversy all the heavy hand in the process\nAll the hyperbole and vilification above side there's always hope\nThat the Senate and save itself\nWe can salvage some decency here at the end\nIf judge Kavanaugh has rejected President Trump will select another nominee likely right of center probably not to my liking but without the cloud\nThat hangs over this nominee and we can proceed to consider that nominee and much less\nBitter much better less partisan way a bipartisan majority of senators considering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh's testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament considering fully\nTestimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford can vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination and asked the president\nTo send the Senate another name for the sake of the center of the Supreme\nCourt ended up America I Hope I pray\nMy colleagues will do so [noise]\nThat's Charles Schumer the Senate minority leader and we're waiting on Mitch McConnell the majority leader next Charles Schumer\nMaking the point argument arguing the Democrats have not delayed this nomination divisions among Republicans have done so those listening to this speech and others include David Axelrod former adviser to President Obama he's now on the line Mr actual rocket mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a ... on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote on [noise]\nTo be the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice cabin up by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination every one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes you ever cash\nIn the Senate now the stakes are always have far Supreme Court nomination but college the extraordinary events original which have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning we will not only did aside and\nWhether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge show our highest court\nNot any more about after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say within the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent\nUntil proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying\nAnd mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate the mob can attack and the Senate caves\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\n\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy on Americans live\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so\nLow\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this\nExcellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long or on full display\nSo let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been traded to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announces the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way to turn it his audience crowds of\nFar left protestors still filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against a\nMore recently we've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nI'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen\nOf a golden opportunity we have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly well qualified and well respected jurors to oppose\nThat demands such action ones we have the opportunity to put judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court or has the saying goes service will make us and our nation proud\nFor years to call but we have the opportunity to do even more today we can send a message to the American people\nThat some core principles remain unfettered by the partisan\nPassions of this moment facts matter fairness matter the presumption of innocence is sacrificing the senator started\nBack on these things before madam president but never for law\nAnd never without deep regret this after Tucson does outlook back proudly on the era of Joseph McCarthy nor on any of the other times on the politics of personal destruction poison\nIs Joshua no no the Senate looks back on those things was shy and when the conviction that we cut out go down that road again\nWhen all the senators better than this\nWhen all of the nation deserve better than this\nBack and farm and judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this brilliant jurist will be charged with upholding the rule of law and honoring American Justice we must hold ourselves to that very same standard\nWe might say is a golden opportunity before us today from a Supreme Court justice who will make us proud\nAnd Korea from our own commitment to the justice that every single American\nDeserves\nThat's Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader the Republican leader wearing a red tie with spectacles reading from his speech\nAdjust now calling him the vote there were about to hear about today one of the most consequential votes you've ever had that is what he described let's listen to the er the action on the floor now\nTo be an associate justice of the Supreme Court or the United states simply Seventeen senators\nGeneticists consent amount of ...\nIs there an objection\nAny action by unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense of the Senate debate on the nomination Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the roll history Alexander\nMs bold one\nOkay recalling the role this is not formally when the votes will be registered that will take a little while uh but we will learn over the next number of minutes how this vote has turned out\nWe should mention the speeches we've just heard are effectively speeches in one sense for an audience of four because they're only about four lawmakers maybe another that we don't quite know about\nWho are in any way undecided here or Murkowski of Alaska flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Manchin of West Virginia NPR's Scott Detrow has been following their progress there's some news about Susan Collins\nYeah we've been saying all morning that this is a key test vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but it is not necessarily the final tally Susan Collins confirmed that saying she is going to vote yes this morning on Kavanaugh but that she will announce her final decision on this weekend's final vote later today\nPeople just joining us may ask wait a minute what final decision if she's voting yes isn't that a guess\nThat is usually the case but there are lots of its moments where where senators will vote to advance the nomination to a final vote and then change their mind that the last moment most high profile example of that John McCain last year health\nCare because we just heard the question on the floor is is it the sense of the Senate that were done with debate in effect to paraphrase what the resolution is that they're voting on you can vote to end debate and still vote against the nominee if you should want to do that there is one ah let's give a listen actually to some of what Susan Collins has been saying today she spoke briefly to reporters off the Senate floor\nI Will be voting yes on the head that sign up for may ... vote and ... may influence and signed out to vote late every kid that pay us\nAnd uh you hear every one trying to get one more question there Susan Collins leaving us in suspense for a few more hours another person on that list of for Joe Manchin the only Democrat from West Virginia a Scott has he been paying attention to those speeches this morning\nHe's been paying very close attention we know that Joe Manchin spent more than an hour and that secure room in the Senate today rereading that report he went to the Senate floor not necessarily giving away his hands on how will vote though we are seeing that just now one of those undecided senators Jeff Flake did appear to vote I on cloture\nAgain that may not necessarily be his final though we know that flake was initially inclined to to support judge Kavanaugh before he changed his mind last\nI'm just mentioned either way mentioned by the way we went to the hearings and sat there sure hours of testimony is Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mentioned votes for cloture then yes this advances to said okay\nSo we're still one vote short they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat is right in this bill may drag out that this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely have to leave the United\nSo let's give a listen to some of that let's bring that up and give a listen ... and\nMs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that key voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that there is very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people that are close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cash that fanatic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killing\nMr Toomey Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live a vote is ... is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sense now the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet to Delaware I went to ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for a cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the rooms that are that in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nVery hard and we know ah in fact we don't know that he'll get fifty one absolutely because senators can vote differently on the final measure in a moment I'm hoping to go outside of the United states Capitol and hear what the response has been to protesters of this news as I'm sure that news is spreading very rapidly outside the United states Capitol\nAh I'd like to ask Ron Elving about having having studied the history of all this as you have what your senses of this moment\nOne moment at this one thought at this particular moment is that those ten senators we were just mentioning where Democrats running in states yeah Donald Trump one and twenty sixty nine of the ten have voted against cloture Joe mansion was the lone\nA Democrat to vote for cloture and he is one of those ten even though it is also necessary to say that he seems not to be in this much trouble as some of the others he seems to be on his way to re election but he did not want to be apparently the Democrat who made it a tie vote\nI to be the corresponding a vote that would have forced Mike Pence to break that particular time but in historical terms uh this is quite unusual because until last year if you had\nFifty one or forty nine votes in this case\nAgainst culture you did not get culture that's right you seem to be had had a sixty votes and and when we talk about Mitch McConnell and his ... significant maneuverings over the years\nNone is more important than his decision to change the filibuster rules so that it would apply that that the filibuster would not apply or not be usable when we came to the Supreme Court nominees he changed that last year for Neil Gorsuch and now of course it's still in place\nI Want to take notice something that you just said there Ron Elving because you said that there are ten Democrats who are seen as vulnerable who are in states that voted for Donald Trump who might see some advantage and voting for the Supreme Court nominee and nine of them chose to vote no and the one who did choose to vote yes seemed to have an option he could have voted no but he decided that he wanted to vote\nYes we presume that so many of these lawmakers so much of the time or making shameless short term political calculations uh [laughter] the evidence is overwhelming that that is very often drew and yet it is not necessarily always true and we heard just yesterday Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nWho is extremely vulnerable uh who seems possibly on her way to a defeat who chose to vote no announced or no vote and the immediate political analysis was well there goes her Senate reelection\nWith China and she said which he said was this isn't a political vote I just couldn't face myself when I got up in the morning if I voted that way they just I've known to many other women like this\nAnd and she is behind in North Dakota by his mouth out as much as you mentioned is ahead in West Virginia so these are different calculations look at somebody like Claire McCaskill in Missouri whose races absolutely neck and neck she also chose to vote no\nAnd a number of these Democrats did vote for Neil Gorsuch he got three democratic votes isn't that right and you know I think that's I think he got three democratic votes\nAnd um and it was assumed that those people would be under tremendous pressure to vote yes again on another Trump nominee even if he were conservative as Brett Kavanaugh is until we got to the allegations of sexual assault and that raised a whole new set of questions\nAnd and so did the cabin up performance at the hearing it wasn't just Christine Blasey Ford who was I think by what the Republicans on Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they believed her they just didn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president of the United states admitted that she was a credible with yeah Philly decided\nBy something red Kavanaugh's performance which he\nSort of kinda apologized for in the wall Street Journal editorial that performance was unlike anything anybody had ever seen by a nominee I think that's one thing that a Chuck Schumer said that is absolutely on debatable um there were things that both\nSchumer and McConnell set in their closing arguments that I thought were poignantly true\nFor the country for the Senate for the shambles that this was I don't think this was a one way street by any means nobody comes away from this either side with completely clean hands but\nIt it devolved at the end into the worst spectacle imaginable for the Supreme Court of the United states\nUh and its standing which is really only a almost an emotional standing that it has that people follow what it says because they believe in it and for the Senate if the United\nStates well let's review some of the remarks that were made in those speeches before the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kavanaugh's nomination Chuck Schumer of New York described Kavanaugh's testimony as the bitter wrist\nPartisan testimony in memory he said that this was a nominee who had hard right conservative George jurisprudence\nAnd then the dam broke there were questions about him according to Schumer and the dam broke with credible allegations of sexual assault decades ago while he was in high school a completely opposite picture painted by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying that\nHidden sinister meetings had been found an innocent statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered great indignity that there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this was one of the most consequential votes you've ever had\nAnd it's a vote that went for Kavanaugh\nThis is special coverage from NPR and\nTo

Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and a West Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that type fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat\nWho voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving has covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic\nConsequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill to court that was sort of like a balanced bored sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on legal questions that have only been sort of under a wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe don't even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nA you know attribute that to the cabinet confirmation and especially among Republican men I think that the issue here is going to be whether or not that's of temporary spike\nAnd you know if Kavanaugh gets through ... does not dissipate to do people move on from that and do they see that there's these elections with less urgency or do they hold on to that\nIt's probably something in between which is usually what happens and also after Labor Day you tend to see a lot more of these groups that seemed sidelined become more energized a and Republican groups generally are the types of groups that become more energized ... are more likely to vote in these elections\n... is it fair to observe normally we would say we're just a month away from the election but given the speed of the news cycle and the amount of news and maybe there were three or four years away from the election at this point\nYou are that's why there's like Seventeen lifetimes between now and election day [noise]\nUh and if there's one thing twenty sixteen uh taught us it is that what seems a certainty at any given moment or is it a a certainty and so there's plenty of time for both sides to make their case on this uh and who who knows what else was going to come up there\nI Would not be surprised if there's an entirely new issue that's not on anyone's radar screen that becomes more determinative collection\nMore lazy democratic strategist he's at Georgetown thanks so much really appreciate it thank you one of the voices we've heard is the vote was prepared for him than cast today fifty one forty nine votes to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the final vote which we'd expect tomorrow one of the voices we've heard\nWas Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer who delivered a speech on the Senate floor of this morning\nA bipartisan majority of senators\nConsidering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh's testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully heartbreaking testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford and vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd asked the president just in the Senate another name for the sake of the center of the Supreme\nCourt end of America I Hope I pray\nMy colleagues will do so\nHis colleagues did not that's Chuck Schumer speaking just before a vote that came down to fifty one forty nine in favor of Brett Kavanaugh moving to that final round that final vote which is expected tomorrow\nLet's bring on someone who Douglas feels differently about that vote than Senator Schumer did Gail Trotter has a spokeswoman for the Judicial Crisis network a conservative group\nThat has campaigned against abortion and on other issues can mourning mourning so you are just the way you said good morning you sound happy\nYes it's been a long process and I just want to take this opportunity to thank senator Collins Senator Flake and than senator Manchin could vote and is this a con for very long and excruciating confirmation process to a final vote\nNow with that said let me ask you about the point that Charles Schumer just raised he essentially argued that whatever you think of bread Kevin uh we have damaged the institution of the Senate were damaged the institutional Supreme Court by moving forward with someone who does not\nEnjoy a broad consensus of opinion even though you agree with judge Kavanaugh even though you favor judge Kavanaugh\nUsed there some damage to moving somebody without a consensus like this\nThere's been a lot of damage to the Supreme Court through this process and through the reputation of the Senate or do we saw that before any of these allegations were ever raised his thought in the two hundred people who are arrested during the hearings the original thirty one hours that judge Kavanaugh testified\nWe thought through the constant and interruptions by senator Kamala Harris and senator Booker we thought through the questioning a judge Kavanaugh and the delay tactics used by the Senate Democrats so I Would agree with Senator Schumer that there hasn't been a lot of\nCollateral damage through this process but I think that that was part of the intention that Senator Schumer said the former President Trump even at ... released the name that judge Kavanaugh as his Supreme Court nominee and Senator Schumer said that they were going to oppose\nPresident Trump's eventual nominee by any means necessary\nCourse he knew that the nominee would be from a list that was approved by a conservative activist group would be a nominee nominated by president who said he expected his nominees to automatically overturn roe versus Wade\nIn the thirty or so seconds we have before this break I just like to know cabinet and say I'm going to overturn roe versus Wade but do you anticipate that he would have an opportunity to do that or something close to it\nNever been about one issue and I but let's ask about that one issue here\nNo one can say that about issued out it was used against Sandra Day O'Connor who upheld rosy way that was used against senator Anthony Kennedy who judge Kavanaugh is going to replacing be another great justice and it's a at a scare tactic used against justices you don't put politics first but instead are faithful\nTo the constitution the independent it didn't work with judge Justice O'Connor it didn't work with Justice Kennedy it shouldn't work with ... ... what we think will be just as a Kevin\n... thanks for taking the time I really appreciate it\nGreat to be like she's with the Judicial Crisis network this is special coverage from NPR News ...\nNah\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] if you don't want to deal with selling or

dot org\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening\nIn the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate the vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage then they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine\nHas specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance denomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual votes would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way\nA vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nThat the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is devoted let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you here to medical well\nI think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate to beat the odds of doing that anywhere or nearly impossible now allow much Alaska well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything\nSo when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought\nCould be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe Manchin when we say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody up as high as state well last time that I'm not a fix which suggests that not as a Democrat ... pro democratic thing I mean that\nSomebody who would ... going on in their voting rights go against their base so when you think about\nPresidents okay so it might be difficult to do that we'll have to see Carrie cubic is on the line she has a White House spokesperson and of course has been following the story closely mourning mourning so uh I'm presuming you're happy with the result that it was a yes rather than to know what do you think about the fact that it was so close fifty one forty nine\nWell you know we're ... we're happy the vote is it an sang unlucky senator obviously I make that decision they think fast but the White House obviously believe that we couldn't ... or qualified person to sit on our us up in\nCourt could you take a moment to answer people who are on the opposite side of the aisle here perhaps even some of the protesters who are outside of the Capitol today who find this\nAs a blow to women as a rebuke to women or do you do you acknowledge that there is some merit and their argument someone made credible allegations against this nomination is advancing anyway\nAnd certainly important to listen to everyone and debate at I probably had a public hearing and that's why the White House\nA combination of class you give us supplemental update here have enough background check and I think we've been pretty different than an hour we have been listening to everyone and that's a conversation\nThat we have to go back to the facts here and that that that accusation that it that leveled against judge Kavanaugh are are uncorroborated in fact I think Senator Grassley pattern statement saying\nThat after reviewing the FBI report that is not even a hint of misconduct and that's all that\nWell let's stay with me for a moment I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is from one of the four speeches that were given on the Senate floor before the fifty one forty nine votes this morning Dianne Feinstein as a Democrat from California is she is the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and here's part of what she had to say\nHe even went so far as to say that Dr forwards allegations were nothing more than quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit healed\nWith pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote quote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and close\nHow putting this behavior revealed hostility and belligerent that is becoming a someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court Dianne\nFeinstein of course there is talking about Brett Kavanaugh talking about his testimony in which he refuted the allegations against him it was said a first that this was exactly the tone that President Trump wanted that he wanted a defiant tone out of his comedy is that true\nBut I think that gets cat and I was certainly justified and then go splat and frustration displaying emotion I got second hearing after an hour that's the first that hearing that was judge Kavanaugh's interview for a job ...\nThis second hearing was judge Kavanaugh defending agitation defending his family and defending against false allegations that I think I agree to gain weight so it means like judge Kavanaugh is pushing back in the way that he did\nYou know I just you know when they go shopping you there I\nI just got to stop you there for one second the gang rape allegation isn't quite true there was a woman who said that he was president in some way for a gang rape and she was someone who was never a particularly her cause was never particularly embraced by any of the Senate Democrats\nOr the ... you've taken a an allegation that is pretty extreme made it a little more so um and it wasn't really embraced by Democrats is that really want Kevin I'll faced\nA well actually I Want to make an allegation and change the story a number of times there you go and say including but gang rape was always a common denominator within her occupation\nThat being that that was part of the whole package that allegations leveled against that's kinda I also after we also have to acknowledge the fact that women have come out defending judge Kavanaugh's treatment of women at you know their personal experiences within ranging from past high school girlfriend\nThe past and present colleagues in South these are women who have praised judge Kavanaugh's respectful treatment high treatment at one end and it and you know these are these are also the voices and said well\nCarrie ... is a White House spokesperson and has been with us twice throughout our coverage here this morning really appreciate your coming to the line twice thanks thanks and good to talk with you and again the headline news here has a fifty one forty nine votes fifty one to forty nine of the United States Senate\nIn favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's Supreme Court nominee this is not the final vote as we've set a few times but it's good to emphasize\nThe final vote is likely to come tomorrow this was a vote to end debate and debate is now ended at least on the floor of the United States Senate but surely not in the country at large and in a few seconds to medical ... is it fair to anticipate that this vote is going to be much discussed is ...\nMore candidates make their final pitches over the next few weeks\nAbsolutely this is going to be a big part of the final push in these final in the final months before election day and it is just setting up what essentially looks like going to be something of a cultural train crash at the voting booths this fall\nAnd will continue covering that train crash whenever and wherever it might happen you are listening to special coverage of the Kevin vote from NPR News\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nI listen to all of Colorado Public Radio's in Colorado Public radio I listen to Colorado Public radio all the time\nWe wanted to know why people keep coming to CPR so we asked a CPR news listener told us it's important to have access to fair\nAnd while research reporting the CPR classical as nurses because it's important for their happiness a fan of CPR is open air that they love making new discoveries news and music that matter this is members' support at Colorado Public radio\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United States Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes run certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nRepublican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kevin all or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh on on the debate Jeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but you give a final\nAnswer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins or what what evidence do we have to go on to the way she's leading well\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently\nFor cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins is she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot pensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about how ... how much you would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a Collins and for or against 'em to last and wound up forcing\nA Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney has it come down and break a tire on a package of tax\nJust a reminder that the vote today as a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance\nAnd you may choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... is executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy or was one of the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this vote\nWhile I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's\nBipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct\nAnd I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nImperfect noises going on in the background or maybe a tiny little off here and there but\nThe song losing travels and you feel you you know in motive Lee\n\nIs a song that you co wrote with your brother your lawn [noise]\nInteresting you wrote this track on your birthday that I

moved in the height of apartheid so it was like wow like this is an incredible place you know\nIf you would have been such a stark contrast\nVery yeah in a lot of my family lives there yeah my friends that moved from India at the same age and other places you know\nBut now I mean there's a lot of crazy happening\nI and I mean I we've been torn the whole world and I've seen this in a lot of different countries and it's not just here but the amount of racism and sexism and\nWe're not as as as forward is we\nOut maybe saw\nAnd you feel that globally I feel like\nI'm

I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about the\n... that he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before\nA Supreme Court nominee using part isn't language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition purely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact\nCause retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nA he said that he'd light cabinet as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision to Kevin wrote but Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that a parent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the record who it is not in a healthy to get a new justice who's going to do for a part time job\nNow I don't really think the cabinet as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones\nIt appears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens than others so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect chief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nYou know Republican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent how is that Brett Kavanaugh will work less than the ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be I mean for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just all you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes where the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that and then any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated I Would expect him to be seated probably Tuesday Morning [noise] wow NPR's Nina Totenberg thanks as always thank you [noise]\n\nYou're

Brett Kavanaugh has secured enough votes to be confirmed the Supreme Court and the final Senate vote is expected tomorrow\nThat's despite Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against the nominee she says Kavanaugh pinned her down and covered her mouth when she tried to scream while they were both at a gathering in high school he has strenuously denied those claims\nAre calling Michel Martin spoke earlier today with one of Ford's lawyer Lisa Banks and Michelle started by asking how professor Ford is doing\nI think she's doing as well as can be expected and I think she's keeping an eye on things and and following what's happening but mostly she's trying to work on getting back to a life as she knew it before does she think she's going to be able to do that\nWell I think she hopes to do that she's not living in our house yet she continues to receive threats but she also continues to receive a thousands and thousands of messages of support\nMany Republican senators even the president initially talked about how credible they found her to be so what does she now make of the fact and what do you now make of the fact that so many of the same senator say that they are nevertheless planning to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh what do you think that means\nI think that means we're in a very political environment and she certainly was credible I think everybody recognizes that she was telling the truth\nThe committee members had to take that information the senators have to take that information and make the best vote they can or to cast the best that they can and I think it's not surprising in this day and age that in large respect this is coming down to a party line vote\nDoes professor Ford wish you could come forward sooner I mean knowing that Republicans have now describe this as a last minute ambush down from her perspective obviously it wasn't I mean she did try to\nReach out to her representative is some months ago but given that this is how it has now been characterized how does she feel about her decision to come forward into she wishes come forward sooner\nWell she came forward when she learned that he was on the shortlist of nominees she came forward to her representative so this was not politically motivated at all he hadn't yet been nominated and at that point she had to make\nThe a difficult calculation of the desire to come forward and perform her civic duty with\nWhat she knew would be the tremendous personal cost to her and her family uh and so she had to weigh that and ultimately she did come forward and that was partly because ah her name was leaked she had initially wanted her name to be confidential\nHow does she feel about coming forward as she glad that she did the sheet regret that she did\nI think she has always felt that it was the right thing to do to provide this information to the Judiciary Committee\nSo they could make the best decision possible and so she does not regret the fact that she did it\nSo if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court [noise] what do you think that meat\nI I don't know that I can say what that means other than we are going to have a debate I think in this country about what it means when women come forward a and how our institutions handle that information and and respond to it but\nI Do have to press the question though if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed even after this messy process will doctor for us feel that she failed\nNo doctor Ford's goal here was never to impact the process to derail the nomination what she was trying to do was what she thought was the right thing to do as a citizen which is to provide the information\nTo the U.S Senate so they could make the most informed decision possible her goal wasn't to derail the nomination it was to inform the nomination and she's done that so there is no way anybody could look at what has happened here and determined that she has failed\nThat's Lisa Banks attorney for
