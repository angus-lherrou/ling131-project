program will need federal funding to maintain Burbank Congressman Adam Schiff a Democrat says he expects bipartisan support\nOther countries of the medical system like this we're actually lagging behind a and as soon as we are to earthquakes a that's a very dangerous position to be\nOne of the one hand there are a lot of products on the market a credit products that has a PR below thirty six percent but as I said the typical payday loan customer or applicant\nHas a credit score a that's five Seventeen it's in the low five hundreds or they're not getting credit cards they're not getting installment loans they're not getting those the sub thirty six percent NPR loans and they're not going to get them a after this ballot initiative if it passes\nA now are these predatory loans I I think that um that's an interesting thing to talk about what does predatory mean usually in the payday loan market and there are a thirty four other states in the country that have pay the loans or as as well as Colorado usually in the ... market\nLooking at issues of predation or abuse with loans that are arguing full in just two weeks and they take more than one third of the customers next paycheck when they come and do they have a few hours in the range of four hundred percent or higher or they have pre payment penalties or other kinds of harmful practices\nThe loans and Colorado because of the two thousand ten law have none of those things so it's not clear to me what what is meant by the term predatory loan in this case\nAnd this goes back a as I said to previous legislation that's been passed in Colorado [noise] uh and so it it sounds like other access to credit would be difficult to come by\n... as you say if the interest rate has kept in Colorado at thirty six percent a payday lenders will be out of the market uh but what do you base that claim on well\nThe as I say they're thirty five states in the country that have payday loan stores or Colorado is unique and its law\nOr the Fifteen states plus D.C that have that do not have payday loan stores\nHave they effective NPR limits in the range of thirty six percent Idaho empirically there's not a state that has that kind of a PR limit and has a store is making a credit available or like a payday loan or a small installment loan to people with this kind of credit score now\nEvery state in the country including Colorado has pawn shops and rent own stores\nWhich often cost a lot more than pay the loans every state in this country has consumers with checking accounts who have see based overdraft programs that charge a typically thirty five dollars every time somebody overdraft they're checking account but payday loan stores do not exist in states where there's ineffective NPR Catholic thirty six percent oh All right\nSo we can look to other states as a harbinger perhaps of what might happen in Colorado if prop ... passes on the midterm valid\nI think it's important to follow the money and the biggest contributor to one eleven is a group called the sixteen thirty fund which is based in North Carolina in fights for among other things tax fairness transparency in government and access to health care\nAnd local donors this is interesting I include the mile high United Way I Want to say that we reached out to multiple payday lenders and none would do an interview on prop one eleven but not surprisingly we can say they oppose this measure [noise]\nIs it possible that if payday loans aren't available in Colorado that people might be a forced into more dangerous situations I mean I I don't know what I Want to paint too bleak picture but like loan sharks is that a possibility or ah the idea of even physical harm or something like that\nYou know the the loan shark thing comes up often there's no evidence of it ...\nEvery now and then you will hear somebody tell a story of how they know somebody who hangs out by a check cashing shop and they'll make a few hundred dollars available and small loans to people and formally um but on a on a widespread bases that just doesn't happen and and that that's for a lot of reasons but I can tell you one big reason it doesn't happen as\nPeople who use pay the loans are generally just kind of mainstream ordinary people they want to use legal stores they don't want to go to alleyways and get cash they're looking for a place that has a sign a storefront customer service some sense of protection\nFrom state law they don't go to um a loan sharks by and large [noise]\nBut um you know what they do do is they look at the other options on the table and some of them will overdraft more some of them will go to a pawn shops more rental shops ... some of them won't borrow as much but um\nI can tell you that in in Colorado with the current pay the loans they're small installment loans everybody has a minimum repayment term of six months a the a PR and the cost of the overall cost is about four times lower than any other payday loan state and so there are a lot of protections\nYeah the question ... when we voter consumers asserting that I'm going to have to wrap it up and I think that the fundamental question facing voters is whether\nColorado law has gone far enough or if they think it needs to go further and grateful for your time [noise] thank you Nick\n... director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable trusts in Washington DC and to reiterate neither he nor you take a position on prop one eleven in Colorado the measure would cap interest rates on payday loans it's thirty six percent\nAnd they'll

Christina gives voice to an end slave black woman who in the Eighteen hundreds endured medical experiments\nProcedures performed by a white doctor considered to be the father of modern gynecology\nChristine as new poetry collection is an orca speaks a history in poems and welcome to Colorado matters thank you for having me you right in the voices of both an arc of the enslaved woman and Dr Jay Marion Sims the white doctor who experimented on her [noise]\nUh let's start with a poem written from Sims perspective Dr Sims makes something new that just set it up for us what is the new thing\nThis is really when he was at the precursor of inventing what would become the modern day speculation which is used today for pap smears and you know kind of like a logical exams\nAnd this grew out of his work some would say torture slaves correct okay so let me have you read this\nDoctor sends make something new what should happen most always is invention there is no wider mystery in the universe than that of woman\nWhat salt and bones she's got she is a composition of asked a thought a borrowed ribbon if you know your Bible she is so easily just a symbol\nI take the ruins stock of ease the wilted pedals the spent flash and bring it wire steel restoration everything we delight in came first by the blood of a woman\nAnd then and then iron and what men do after\nIt is well documented that seems experimented on female slaves as part of his gun logical research correct [noise] what do these women endured during and after the experiments that poem really gives you the sense that there's a dehumanizing going on here\nRight and of course you know the the institution of slavery was already participating in that the human evasion and the modification of bodies so\nFor me it's it's about doctors then sort of\nGlacial this inclination toward his subjects they were just subjects they were not human beings they were not afforded the rights or the proper considerations that you would you know offer to a human being or someone that you respected or valued or empathize with\nAnd fundamentally what he was trying to do because there was sort of a stigma attached to treating women I'm particularly guy like logically so he was trying to figure out a way to repair it damages that were done during labor and delivery traumas specifically the ethical ... you know\nThere's still a tears um and so he quarter these enslaved women in this makeshift hospital behind his house in Alabama and experimented on them with the intent of perfecting that procedure and then offering it to white women and he did so without anesthesia anesthesia without\nAnesthesia right there was a belief I've read that a black people could not feel pain that was part of correct what was in his I'd go to the point\nThat is right that was the prevailing sort of ideology at the time that black people did not record pain in the body the same way that others did and so it was fundamentally a way to justify brutality\nAnd so for these slaves for the people he was experimenting on this would have been incredibly painful of course on for a long time of course yes ... would ever have been beneficial to them\nYeah ah it's my understanding that he did repair some of these terrorists to the women um I think for me it's about\nProcedure um they were tortured and there was a ton of blood letting before repair was done right and so there was still no real regard for their humanity or their person yes he fixed certain injuries but he created others\nI have been hunted since reading your collection I mean just just so haunted by this history I Wonder how it affected you when you first learned about an hour 'cause story and let's be clear that Antarctica is a a was a real life person\nAbsolutely um I found her by accident I'm at a mall just so I went looking for the etymology of the word anarchy and I've found is name than ash strict Antarctica\nAnd needed to try to track her down and it was clear that she was only the only language that was being curated for her\nIs it as a means to talk about the doctor Jay Marion sense and I was appalled by that then that would be the ... that's right in his story that's right the not the other way around that's right and so for me it was about trying to leave enough room for her\nTo be able to speak and tell her story and and move as much of myself and my own projections out of the way which is really hard to do um but I think are really necessary thing to do if you're going to attempt to press on a ... you\nAre listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're speaking with the Denver poet dominate Christina and she has a new collection of poetry called a ... speaks a history and poems\nAnd it should shreds lied on some pretty terrible history a that on top of inflaming people in the United states slaves were also subjected to medical experiments and\nAh I I think what's what's so painful and so complicated here is that much of the science the medical practice today is based on this and that's right\nThat's right isn't that complicated yes speaks to speak to that\nFor me as a woman you know it does it creates a tremendous complication for me I I recognize that there is always a balancing act that is required when we talk about what we are the beneficiaries of in our present day reality is\nWe have to at some point interrogate how we got here and often times there was torture or pain or wounding or bruising in the back of it\nAnd so it does create a complication\nFundamentally for me though and aka is not singular there's still a very important an urgent conversation around women today who do not have authorship over their bodies particularly during labor and delivery\nYou're still being prescribed and dictated to in the hospital room\nIt was very important to me that in this conversation we hear you use a ... voice of the collection and it's frankly the voice that I had like towards the end of the conversation we're left with her words would you read a poem called no magic no how\nYes\nNo magic know how that's when I take down my own dumb heart right there\nWere massive back to say I am meal what a few more miles left to a slave us stop by Stillwater on his way to someplace right there right there when massive Dr look right passed away I hurt to say she it's

vote for and twenty sixteen money who did you vote for him twenty sixty\nEight twenty six feet I did vote for Trump not because my my reason was it was all the all the best of since ... she's an idea was slow what strips so maybe that's not in the political will to guess shortly after that is when I realized that huge mistake fears\nOf more early human being there for the United states of America\nWhat changed your mind Monty what changed your mind\nWhen he started you know every every every time he starts walking the dog or the greater use of the authors of the United states and that

... he was talking about\nExplicitly grabbing women he wanted charges of sexual harassment new so all of that you were okay\nNo no yeah somewhat Monti you were willing to overlook that\nBut what what is it because we went into the I'm trying to I'm just trying to do very wherever you find people who are going to miss they change their minds\nAnd and I agree I mean my my work but I Would talk about this all the time you know I did like I say it was almost as if it was entertaining up and sold it for five said he was elected and then you're you're ... when you when you wake up all of those ... oh my gosh did I ever make a mistake\nAnd multi taking my buddy thanks for the call I'm American was in a coma I Want to go to ... Knoxville, Tennessee Knoxville, Tennessee Kim from Knoxville thanks for calling into a miracle on the line you are obviously\nIn one of the key swing states uh this year are you going to be voting you see this election as a referendum for or against Donald Trump\nVoter today and it is definitely a referendum on trial especially since Marsha Blackburn is basically strapped herself to the president and this race for the Senate\nHad I'm a mom of two moderate I've voted on both sides of the aisles I've I was the ... over the years because I Lived and very conservative place but I end up hall set\nMy children are watching president because I have for this way and I was raised Catholic Republicans and so it is just stunning to me that this man has everything that we are ways not to be yet my Republican friends and family voted for this\nPerson and so I Am definitely vote and based on the president\nAnd this race and he has taught himself to Marsha Blackburn and so I have voted for ...\nFor the call I appreciate Marsha Blackburn has tied herself to to Donald Trump you know it's interesting that you get asked the question every once in a while you know when when when Trump campaigns when he goes into red states or does it help Republicans I mean is is Donald Trump nationalizing this election does it help or hurt Republicans\nAnd I think that the the honest answer is well it depends where you're talking about that you have the the double edged sword you know that every time Donald Trump goes out I think he probably does fire up the Republican base but he also fires up the Democratic base as well Mona\nYes agreed um and uh but but the tolerance for his kind of politics vastly exceeds anything that we imagined in earlier times like\nTwo years ago um and uh [laughter] and we were laughing about that but that's true I mean another oh there are things that are happening in there who used to think it was like before nine eleven after nine eleven and now it's like pre twenty sixteen after\nYeah and uh and so you know we will see the the um the the Republican Party I cannot disagree has become more and more Trump aside and more and more fine with him as their leader and as a\nAs a spokesman for our country and um you know I I Am not at all confident that there are large numbers of Republicans who feel as some of our callers to\nThat they can no longer support this president if they once did or that they never did because they're embarrassed by him I think all too many are set and yeah this is great were winning and this is what it takes and we were jumps before and now this is this is a success\nThat is one of the extraordinary things at least from my point of view is is that you know Donald Trump is who he was he he didn't actually changed but a lot of Republicans decided they were going to adapt to him looking for should we have to leave it here we go on for another hour\nI Want to thank all of our guests tonight and thanks to all of you for listening and remember you can tweet us ...

and says that things that are as father or his own\nAnd he tells the reporter that he's worth in excess of two hundred million dollars and everything he pointed to in the story that would go to his his net worth at that time was his father's he had a tax return to a few years later where we see he declared a I think he may twenty five thousand dollars a couple of years last year\nActually I got out actually that year Nineteen seventies now and yet he was sitting there saying that he was worth two hundred million dollars and it was a claim that he would\nBecome part of the claim that would put him on the very first list of wealthiest Americans published by Forbes magazine in the Nineteen I Want to say what eighty ... eighty one somewhere in there\nWas a spectacular con\nAnd I guess Donald Trump got used to people taking him at his word even one his word wasn't true\n[noise] yeah I'd be things build up right they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and they\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs are they going to look at what's been written about before and it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling us his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly\nYou know to make themselves a celebrity and to gain power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um in based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans he got from his father the tax evasion schemes that family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk\nMore about how Donald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported\nJust a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged incest back tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump mess about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money ... Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a ... gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] and we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars of ... two hundred and forty million dollars in loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and\nDirect wealth that we saw transferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is to have in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise] um we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond\nSell it to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something different ... and that was a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nAnd as we started out on the recording us I'm at one of the questions\nI'm immediately we knew Fred Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with this money I'm an every penny was you know you could see it you would account for it he was a guy who would walk construction sites and if you saw a nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere\nSo we found it hard to believe that he wasn't already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers and the the the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and and we looked for um\nPossible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals are we throw our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county had it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then build ... and it was a and basically an invoice ... operation where they were just overcharge Fred on these items that it's sort of no other purpose\nWhen the Trump sibling set up all county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from ... give it to the children did Fred Trump know about the company by the purpose of the company was he a knowing\nPart of its creation [noise]\nWe think that he absolutely was he was an enormous strategy meetings where they came up with these ideas and it appealed to him because it was um she was someone who just\nHated the idea of putting any kind of gift or a state taxes and we also see the signature on trucks um that were written to all county building supplies so it was a man who\nPaid close attention to every penny and so there's there's evidence both in the reporting in in the documents\nThat he was absolutely um this was something that he was all on board with\nAnd then in a way like the collateral victims of these inflated cost where rent or is in a lot of fat Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators themselves\nAs a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent controlled unit that's right when\nYou're an owner of a building and you have rent controlled apartments you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state to have the rent increased\nAnd you have to send over proof when you do that that you've made various improvements in this case they use the potted receipts in many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should've been rent increases and then the depositions that we have them we obtain journal reporting Robert Trump Arnold Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the markup the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter Fred the parents died in June Nineteen Ninety nine at age Ninety three you say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of\nThe tax strategies to transfer money to the Trump children\nBut you're right the single largest item included infrared Trump's estate tax return was it ten point three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald tramp appear to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's debt to banks\nAnd this is the first time hearing that he owned his father millions of dollars on his father died\nWell he owed his father money for most of his life um and there were repeated\nStrategies through the years to do something of those unpaid that's that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point\nDonald Trump or whose father somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen million bucks and the problem is that if his father simply canceled it that\nWell in the eyes of the Irish are cancelled dollar debt is the same as a dollar of in some sort of read Trump simply chancellor ... said I forgive you you don't have to pay me back Donald Trump was owed a chunk of tax for what's called cancellation of that\nSo Donald Trump and Fred Trump came up with this other way of making that are completely disappear involved trading that debt for steak in one of Donald Trump's buildings so Fifteen\nDollars or so of that for a steak in a building called Trump Palace and then and then a few years later\nFred Trump sold that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son for ten thousand dollars proof there goes that huge debt\nAnd I guess or New

reporters says and crab and David Barstow who along with rescue near published a long investigative article this month but ... use schemes to avoid paying taxes on transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars now received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision\n[noise] so the interesting thing about\nThat sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after Trump died they would hand out ... you know Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk and then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assemble the private sale to his developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo that the the uh buildings that were sold ... those buildings ... Frank ... own at this time of his death I Hope that it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThat included both the buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire\nAnd it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through\nThe thought sale price was was roughly just under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see the ... empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that are us actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this return them for a million more bucks\nHis childhood was happy he says the family's close he does not like the view that kids who grow up without fathers are deprived who cares you just need one person to love you is loving mother owned a hair salon in South central Los Angeles mock grew up their\nLocal women came in after work and sat under the dryers while they studied for degrees everything that\nGoes on in the hair salon intimacy gossip stories told between women struggles with power labor all of that is imbedded in hair dye and in papers\nEnd papers used to straighten African American hair or for ...

authorities to target people here illegally Huntington Beach argued we can cooperate with them if we want to a\nCity council meeting about this issue lasted six hours and\nDrew more than a hundred speakers there were people there were signs that things like we heart President Trump and also build walls to force them\nOld passion you can understand where it comes from if you talk to a voter like Donna killer\nWell I'm I'm a woman single ... single so my first thing a safety ... illegal immigration is always on my mind you don't know who's coming here find you will never seeing in LA or you know certain cities after dark because it's just I don't feel safe\nDone a killer is the daughter of an immigrant herself her mom moved to the U.S from Japan I was chatting with done it this week at her home which also serves as a workspace for her ceramics business\nYou know see a lot of people that can do these on ceramic pieces of beautiful yeah well I had a helper named Pablo and he was amazing and he was deported and she should be here\n[noise] so what what do you think of President Trump in general and his approach to immigration\nUm I like it because I think he has to be that way\nIt's like what if someone who is concerned about immigrants' rights said to you how can you have it both ways how can you both support someone like Pablo and your other friends who are in the country illegally and also support President Trump who is so tough\nOn people who are in the country illegally like how can you\nHow kind of how can I put those two together are\nI don't see a chance like that I don't think you I don't think they're mutually exclusive I think you could want to have good laws to protect us 'cause that's the main job with the federal government is to protect us need borders\nAnd I also think that there's room to have these people that want to come here and have a better life that they should be able to stay here you know I think there should be a way that we should say you know Mr ... you need to let you know Pablo stay here is a law abiding citizen\nAnd get the little the sleazy ones that are you know doing the trafficking and the drugs in the open you know that's that's what we have to focus on not the people they just want to bring something to the table here I mean don't you agree\nWhat role with his with his election play\nWell I think it's it'll put more people in Congress and the Senate hopefully and it'll be able to push through\nTrump's agenda and I I think because the left from what I'm hearing if they get powered all they're going to do is investigations and impeach dots that doesn't when my heart and I think if they win that's what they're going to do and I don't think that's a good thing\nNow done a killer told me not everyone has reacted so well to her support of the president\nOh yeah I have people on my face with the Comey races and all this other stuff and I'm like really your friends with the race to flight ... on friending me if you think I'm a racist\nWhy do they call you then because I support trends and it's just so sibling becoming is is that her it's surprising\nTo me that they would say that to me 'cause I'm like the nicest person in the world like I Would do anything for anybody I waited on\nThese friends with people who you know yeah their friends and it's like\nI call it that trumped arrangements syndrome I Know you've heard of it but it's just so like different people when you bring up from it's like a flip the switch for them\nNow about three miles away in another hundred you'd be home we spoke with Shane of late for them\nTo the cabinet quarters at the all camel band ... everything else right back here\nShe is a middle school teacher who's running for city council and we seem to have nothing at all in common with on a killer then again these are two women who politics are motivated by the same emotion fear ... said she remembers feeling it at her middle school the morning after Trump was elected\nOn that day when I Know that so many people are just devastated and in shock and calling back into the covers I knew I didn't have the luxury of doing that because I had hundreds as Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified but what what was during them they were worried that their parents were going to be deported\nAnd some of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous\nAnd it definitely has an effect on how they learn\nIn what way when you're living in fear it's really hard to learn about things like cells and body systems and I have several students who we've been trying to get their parents to come in for conferences or to discuss their child's individualized education plan\nThat won't come because they're afraid of getting picked up and the students have shared with me and my mom doesn't have paper so we don't leave they can't they're afraid to come to school\nSheena late this is a Democrat and that's the way she's going to be voting next month for her Lee router over Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher\nBut she says what she wants most is lawmakers were willing to work with the other side\nI have to believe that there are people on both sides of the aisle that really do want to work together\nThat this divisive mess I really want to believe that that's not who we are as a nation\nBecause it's it's amazing just as a journalist who watches these debates from afar um it seems like so quickly\nYou are labeled as someone who just wants to protect immigrants in this country doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nIs how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet but if you're out there and the community and you're walking\nAnd with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together than divides us\nAnd so you'd be ready to settle people down who were just calling the president racist and say that's that's not helpful let's let's try and work through this\nI I Would do that absolutely I don't know that I Would actually be able to come out and say he's not racist but I think I could say something along the lines of continuing to push that\nNarrative is not helpful what is something that we can talk about that it's helpful\nThat was the voice of Sheena laces and before that we heard from Donna killer there to voters here in orange County California and we're going to take you to other corners of this district

at all across the state things will be getting warmer so that by Sunday the weather forecast says that a highs around Denver will be above Seventy degrees to end the weekend [noise]\nThanks for listening to MORNING EDITION on this Friday you can always find a lot of Colorado news at CPR dot org that's also where you can check out our podcast called ... the talks about Colorado politics and a lot more ... is that what you look for their CPR dot org the CPR news [noise]\nA lot of the story here as people who are hourly wage earners who have all at all uncommon almost half of the household in this country or what researchers would call in ... and older their income changes by twenty five per se\nSpent more and more for a month to month and and that's often because they're working at a retail store factory or somewhere else where they're paid hourly and the number of hours that they were changes quite a bit so it's people in that situation there they're finding gaps of three or four hundred dollars here or there and their income and they're looking for help to pay a bill\nAnd it's interesting a and perhaps not what people might have assumed about those who take up heyday lungs\nI Want to see that in a Denver Post column John Caldera the independence Institute in Denver rails against prop one eleven claiming that it assumes poor people are stupid and he writes quote payday loan guys aren't saints\nBut their customers are in fact terrible credit risks many rack up massive debts to them declare bankruptcy leaving the lender with nothing to make up this loss lenders charge wildly high rates and fees\nSo we're going to do some fact checking here Nick are these interest rates justified by the risk of the people taking these loans well\nLet me start by saying we don't have a position on this ballot initiative for us this was an issue for the voters to decide but the the question that the voters have to decide here really is should we have pay the loans stores in Colorado or not because of thirty six percent\nRate cap like what the ballot initiative proposes will eliminate the payday loan stores in Colorado empirically there's not a state that has that kind of a PR limit and has stores making a credit available\nI think one thing that's been lacking in this debate as far as I've been able to see it is some nuance about what's really going on in Colorado versus the extreme view points of\nThere shouldn't be regulation on the one hand or there shouldn't be stores on the other\nColorado has right now today by far the market with the lowest rates the most affordable payments and the strongest consumer protections of any payday loan market in the country I haven't seen the people talking about that so\nThe comment that payday lenders are charging exorbitant rates um is justifiable in the sense that they charge a lot higher than a credit card but the law in Colorado has a lot of protections and it's important to keep in mind with quality of these loans is much different and much better than in other states\nTo to comment that you raised yes payday lenders are making loans to people who on average have credit scores in the low five hundreds they they are much bigger credit risks and that is why state law currently allows people to charge more than thirty six percent on alone\nI Will say that the legislature has actually taking action on this in two thousand and seven and then again in twenty ten so it's not as if this ballot measure is the first volley in Colorado to reform payday lending [noise]\nWhat do we do some more fact checking so we spoke with current Fowler she's campaign manager for prop one eleven\nAnd she says there are other ways for low income folks to get loans\nThere are a lot for taking him are now through their credit unions and their ... and even their credit card or a much lower alone for every individual that takes alone is at ... individual and they not likely had access to that sort of credit that they may not be aware of\nCandies borrowers find other access to credit and and I ... I guess she's assuming that's better access to credit\nOne the one hand there are a lot of products on the market a credit products that has a PR below thirty six percent\nBut as I said the typical payday loan customer or applicant has a credit score a that's five Seventeen and some low five hundreds or they're not getting credit cards they're not getting installment loans they're not getting those sub thirty six percent NPR loans and they're not going to get them a after this ballot initiative if it passes\nI Want to say that we reached out to multiple payday lenders and none would do an interview on prop one eleven but not surprisingly we can say they oppose this measure [noise]\nIs it possible that if pay the loans aren't available in Colorado that people might be forced into more dangerous situations I mean I I don't know I don't want to paint too bleak picture but like loan sharks is that a possibility or\nYou know the the loan shark thing comes up often there's no evidence of it OK I'm\nEvery now and then you will hear somebody tell a story of how they know somebody who hangs up by a check cashing shop and they'll make a few hundred dollars available in small loans to people and formally but on a on a widespread basis it just doesn't happen\nWell thanks for joining us thank you Nick ... is director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable trust in Washington DC we talked about prop one eleven on the Colorado ballot this year which would set a thirty six percent cap on interest rates for payday loans I'm Ryan Warner CPR news [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise] Mm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to end up news from Colorado Public radio on Ninety point one F.

the house or whether Democrats take control\nWe visited three corners of the seaside district in one was Huntington Beach a place that many calls surf city usa\nNow California might be known for the anti Trump resistance will you might say Huntington Beach is part of the resistance to that resistance it's a conservative city that won a lawsuit against the state government over its so called sanctuary law\nCalifornia lawmakers don't want local police departments cooperating with federal immigration authorities to target people here illegally\nHuntington Beach argued we can cooperate with them if we want to a city council meeting about this issue lasted\nSix hours and drew more than a hundred speakers there were people there were signs said things like ... heart President Trump and also build walls to force\nPassion you can understand where it comes from if you talk to a voter like Donna killer\nWell I'm I'm a woman single ... single so my first thing is safety ... illegal immigration is always on my mind you don't know who's coming here find you will never seeing in LA or you know certain cities after dark because it's just I don't feel safe\nNot a killer is the daughter of an immigrant herself her mom moved to the U.S from Japan I was chatting with done it this week at her home which also serves as a workspace for her ceramics business\nYou don't see a lot of people that can do these um ceramic pieces of beautiful yeah well I had a helper named Pablo and he was amazing and he was deported and she should be here\nSo what what do you think of President Trump in general and his approach to immigration\nUm I like it because I think he has to be that way\nBut what if someone who is concerned about immigrants' rights so to you how can you have it both ways how can you both support someone like Pablo and your other friends who are in the country illegally\nAnd also support President Trump was so tough on people who are in the country illegally like how can you\nHow ... how can I put those two together are\nI don't see a chance like that I don't think you I don't think they're mutually exclusive I think you could want to have good laws to protect us 'cause that's the main job with the federal government is to protect us need borders\nAnd I also think that there's room to have these people that want to come here and have a better life that they should be able to stay here you know I think there should be a way that we should say you know Mr ... you need to let you know Pablo stay here he is a law abiding citizen\nAnd get the little the sleazy ones that are you know doing the trafficking and the drugs in the open you know that's\nThat's what we have to focus on not the people that just want to bring something to the table here I mean don't you agree what role with his with his election play well I think it'll put more people in Congress and the Senate hopefully\nAnd it'll be able to push through\nTrump's agenda and I I think because the left from what I'm hearing if they get powered all they're going to do with investigations and impeach dots that doesn't when my heart and I think if they win that's what they're going to do and I don't think that's a good thing\nNow done a killer told me not everyone has reacted so well to her support of the president\nOh yeah I'd have people on my face but Comey races and all this other stuff and I'm like really your friends with the race to find it on friending me if you think I'm a racist\nWhy do they call you then because I support Trump and it's just so\nSibling becoming is is that her it's surprising to me that they would say that to me because I'm like the nicest person in the world like I Would do anything for anybody I waited on\nThese friends with people who you know their friends and it's like I called trumped arrangements syndrome I Know you've heard of it but it's just so like different people when you bring up for like a flip the switch for them\nNow about three miles away in another hundred to a beach home we spoke with Shane of leases them\nInto the cabinet quarters it's all campaigned ... recent mal right back here\nIs a middle school teacher who's running for city council and we seem to have nothing at all in common with on a killer then again these are two women who hosts\nSix are motivated by the same emotion fear ... said\nShe remembers feeling it at her middle school the morning after Trump was elected\nOn that day when I Know that so many people are just devastated and in shock and calling back into the converse I knew I didn't have the luxury of doing that because I had hundreds as Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified but what what was giving them they were worried that their parents were going to be deported\nAnd some of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous\nAnd it definitely has an effect on how they learn\nIn what way when you're living in fear it's really hard to learn about things like cells and body systems and I have several students who we've been trying to get their parents to come in for conferences or to discuss their child's individualized education plan\nThat won't come because they're afraid of getting picked up and the students have shared with me and my mom doesn't have paper so we don't leave they can't they're afraid to come to school\nSheena late this is a Democrat and that's the way she's going to be voting next month for her Lee router over Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher\nBut she says what she wants most is lawmakers who are willing to work with the other side\nI have to believe that there are people on both sides of the aisle that really do want to work together that this divisive mass I really want to believe that that's not who we are as a nation\nBecause it's it's amazing just as a journalist who watches these debates from afar um it seems like so quickly\nYou're labeled as someone who just wants to protect immigrants in this country doesn't care about the safety of people and people on the other side are labeled as racist and there's just no way to to actually build bridges\nThat is how it looks if you're reading things on the Internet but if you're out there in the community and you're walking with us you'll see that there's far more than it does bring us together then divides us\nAnd so you'd be ready to to to settle people down here we are just calling the president racist and say that's that's not helpful let's let's try and work through this\nI I Would do that absolutely I don't know that I Would actually be able to come out and say he's not racist but I think I could say something along the lines of continuing to push that narrative is not helpful what is something that we can talk about that is helpful\nThat was the voice of Sheena laces and before that we heard from Donna killer there to voters here in orange County California and

C. Saudi Arabia suspected role in the disappearance of a journalist has thrown a shadow over Saudi money\nAmerican businesses have enjoyed Saudi investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia is absolute monarchy it's brutal war in Yemen and above all about the reported murder of journalist Jamal ...\nMuch Saudi money has gone to Silicon Valley and do some tech CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... says just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them the Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years the Saudi sovereign wealth fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks\nIn Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund\nForty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund was the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision ... the Saudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others\nAre a lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saturday investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIs varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that ... people and that might well have murdered ... and the consulate me stumble that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and he got so graduates columnists to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op [noise] but do you have any evidence that winds Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spent time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the false city of those protections to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth\nThat is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley and I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many of your listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar megacities the Saudis are creating called Neal and Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley and make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in\nIf these people are basically no better than chemical magnates\nDumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand\nWhat was it like in the last several days as you are traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain that America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and that things need to change but in the private conversation Steve I Will tell you deep\nIn the bowels of these institutions\nThere is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wield and the privileged they wield that some of the people who founded these companies have been catastrophic Lee blind to\n[noise] on a gear to us is the author of the book winners take all thanks very much for coming by\nThank you Steve are an American graduate student has been released from the airport in Tel Aviv after being detained for more than two weeks we have more from NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem\nLower cost them is twenty two years old and a recent graduate of the University of Florida\nShe landed in Israel at the beginning of the month for a master's program and human rights at an Israeli university but authorities at the airport denied her entry under twenty Seventeen law banning activists affiliated with the pro Palestinian campaign to boycott Israel\nAll costs them used to have a small chapter of a pro boycott student group but now she says she no longer supports the boycott she was held at the airport while she fought in court for the right to enter Israel\nHer story caught international attention following several other cases of Israel detaining left wing critics at the airport\nAnd border and it caused some embarrassment in Israel and then I had some of the Senate deputy\nForeign minister see peaceful to belly told Israeli radio last week that Israel's ban on all costs him was not very successful she said Israel should reconsider how it applies at century ban when it turns into an international issue we lose more than we when she said\nBut Israeli strategic affairs minister ... ... who led Israel's campaign to ban all cost them defended them of\nBringing the little guy and he said we don't just look at articles in New York Times and the media critical of Israel argued there are thousands of pro Israel students in the U.S will contend with pro Palestinian activists on campus who will support our move without cost them\nProponents of the boycott they've estimate and sanctions movements say there peacefully protesting Israel's treatment of Palestinians but Israeli leaders have called it a campaign to undermine Israel's legitimacy as a country\nLaura customs case reached Israel's Supreme Court which ruled that caused some had not been involved in boycott activities for more than a year and had demonstrated an academic curiosity about Israel she was released from the airport yesterday ... is her lawyer\nIt's a victory for free speech academic freedom and the law large Keith ... thought pleasing had absolutely no place in a democracy\nA right wing Israeli activist group said it would be closely monitoring cost them during her time in Israel to ensure she did not promote a boycott the Hebrew University of Jerusalem which had supported al ... case in court said it looked forward to having her on campus next week Daniel Estrin NPR News Jerusalem\nThis is NPR News this is CPR\nNews I might limp good morning nine forty two and Colorado matters begins at ten o'clock and the team at Colorado matters is already working to put together what has become\nKind of a CPR tradition that's what they call the Colorado matters holiday extravaganza maybe you caught it

you can see how to audition for that spot at CPR dot org just search the word extravaganza and you could be on stage there with the Colorado matters and our other guests for the holiday show\nThe address is CPR dot org and that is also where you will catch our new podcast called ...\nAnd a lot of other election coverage and news from all around Colorado CPR dot org and this is CPR news\nYou started at the post one week before the Lewinsky story broke\nOne week before the Lewinsky story broke exactly I was supposed to be the deputy national editor in charge of investigation so at the time that was the Clinton fundraising scandal now mostly forgotten in the annals of history\nAnd when the Lewinsky story broke how did you all initially think about framing we're kind of story was it\nWell it was a political earthquake and I remember standing slack jawed in the post newsroom along with you know hundreds of other journalists\nWhen President Clinton came out and said you know I did not have sexual relations with that one and in hindsight it seems more clear cut what the outcome was going to be but there were certainly moments when we felt along the way that the Clinton presidency with hanging in the balance\n[noise] I've been going back for some of the post coverage of the times and trying to reconcile what you were writing with what I remember feeling I'm Around the same age as Monica Lewinsky and I'm struck when I look back at how women of my generation didn't rally around her\nThe culture has shifted and you know as a woman in many ways I'm sure you know you and I both welcome many of the changes and the revelations have the last year about sexual exploitation of women harassment of women in the workplace\nAnd this unfortunately was not reflected in either the politics or the culture of that moment it was at\nA sexist environment in Washington in some ways that are still true today and some ways that things are are not\nFeel really of a different time we had to look back at it now setting aside things the Clintons have said in this last year it was really Donald Trump who played a big role in rejecting the Clintons sex scandals into the national political debate at the second presidential debate he brought Clinton's accusers style\nI wanted to sit down here to support those\nActions speak louder than words [noise]\nMr Trump might have said that\nJuanita broader speaking right before walking into the presidential debate to sit in the audience with Paula Jones and other Clinton accusers\nSusan Glasser the read on that was Trump was wheeling out Clinton's accusers in order to deflect from the Access Hollywood tape in order to deflect attention from his own accusers did it work well\nI think Trump has learned a lot from how Bill Clinton survived the impeachment scandal and raising it out\nAnd denying or telling the truth slowly you know Trump did use the female accusers of Bill Clinton to shield himself I guess that he knew correctly that Democrats would be accused of being hypocrites that has continued to be the case throughout the subsequent me two\nRevolutions which took place after the twenty sixteen campaign and many people myself included\nBelieve that part of that sort of national furor over the meat you stories has been a response in some ways to the fact that there is another male president in the oval office who has been credibly accused of misconduct by numerous women in Trump's case I Believe it's Nineteen women\n[noise] do you think Bill Clinton would have survived the Lewinsky scandal if it unfolded today\nYou know that is the question I Will say that the Democratic party has shifted publicly at least more than the Republican Party when it comes to what to do about members in their own ranks who are accused of this kind of wrongdoing look at how quickly they abandoned Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota\nYou know maybe that would have happened with Bill Clinton maybe not\n[noise] do you think it serves a purpose to reckon with Bill Clinton's legacy at this point where does it leave us or is it time to let it go well\nI Do think Donald Trump's continued mentioning of the Clinton to return suggests how useful part is in\nFoil it is at this hyper partisan time\nYou know there's some truth to Bill Clinton's point that we have litigated\nThis issue two decades ago and to me the fact that it does keep recurring is largely a reflection of the fact that we're grappling as a country with the unique presidents have Donald Trump and the many allegations of wrongdoing
