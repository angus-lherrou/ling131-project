one of the sites that immediately comes to mind is west highschool so which was in Nineteen sixty nine the site of a series of walkouts by students who were protesting\nRacist policies by the school and poor treatment by their their teachers and they were demanding that diversification of the curriculum end of the staff\nThis is in Denver yes yeah and just say a bit more about why that is such a pivotal moment\nSure so it was Nineteen sixty nine which was at the height of the Chicano Movement nationally and it was this important turning point where students in Denver started to take a more prominent role and activism\nAnd so they took a stand with support from community members about you know their treatment in Denver public schools and staged a big walkout at West high school which turned into a big blow out um but it was an important turning point in the movement for sure and\nI I guess your point is that a lot of people one don't know that history and what it's not well marked right even wonder if students at West know about this\nI think a lot of them don't know about this history and it's not well marked in it's something that I think that that should be marked more clearly about another example\nUm another example would be again many of these examples come from the Chicano Movement air in the Nineteen sixties and seventies and one is the students at CU Boulder who in Nineteen um [noise]\nWell you can guess numbers but the accuracy summers is partial\n... points out that when it comes to a DL or other nonprofit the incidents they're tracking may not rise to the level of an actual reported crime and if you're looking for data on hate crimes that have occurred like house says there's a number of reasons why the law enforcement data\nMay not be as reliable even FBI data\nCollection local law enforcement agencies who internists keep track we just found a huge variety of\nWays that police out kayaking these on forums on internal systems and we've just sounds so many problems with how they're actually currently and we've found undercount hanging over accounting\nComplicating things even more ... pointed to a twenty Fifteen survey by the Federal Bureau of justice statistics that found more than half of people who were targeted by a possible hate crime did not report it to police last year the Denver based Matthew Shepard foundation dug deeper to learn to reason why people may not report\nOne of the biggest takeaways many were uncertain whether what happened to them was a crime\nThe latest available year of FBI data that's twenty sixteen showed that Colorado reported one hundred and four hate crimes twenty Seventeen numbers will be out later this fall I'm Ann Marie ...

town once stood those are the kinds of places Ron Rouhani off of Janelle a Colorado likes to visit he is the last remaining charter member of the ghost town club of Colorado founded sixty years ago I run\nHello there Ryan you visit goes downs both with the club and by yourself I understand there's one near Telluride it's among your favorites will you tell us about it\nWell down your child you ride there's a beautiful ghost town called alpha\nIt's got to be the most photogenic place with old buildings in the foreground than a beautiful San Miguel arranging the back it's an interesting town it was still alive up until about Nineteen forty five\nPeople working the gold king mine in that particular mine had a at a very special a feature because the very first alternating current power plant hydro plant was built right there to run the machinery in that mine\nAnd it was a built by George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla\nMy goodness we we recognize both of those names for sure Westinghouse in\nTown that a power plant is still an operation today of course not the original equipment\nBut there's a lot to see an out and is it that anyone can just walk in\nYou can go up there is a four mile dirt road off Colorado highway one forty five just south of Telluride but [noise]\nUh nope no big problem to go up there in the car and uh the three outs of lakes are there some nice fishing camping what explains its decline\nIt was probably the uh war time for one thing and a lack of a or a worthwhile or pretty well run out it was primarily gold in that mine\nLater stand there is some seven hundred ghost towns in Colorado ... what makes that goes to like does it have to be completely abandoned\nWell they're probably several different kinds of ghost towns there's of out of those seven hundred\nProbably at least five hundred a ... really nothing left anymore you wouldn't necessarily that there's a town there but uh there used to be in places like that are fun to see even if you're looking in an open\nI Do and hadn't have an old photograph with the chose what was there a hundred years ago\nDo a little of your own before and after would you give us an example of a town like that\nWell one might be um up at a camp pale\nOn tendency pass that was a military camp during World War two and it was a tremendous place eventually it was all torn down and you go by that big metal today and you see some concrete foundations and that's about all that remains\nSo that's one kind of guy stand the kind that really uh he's empty today has no structure is and that's the the bulk of them what other kinds of guys towns are there\nWell we have the kind that has several buildings still remaining but no one lives there anymore and we have examples of that such as Ashcroft over near Aspen independence\nUp on highway eighty two above Aspen and I'm altos one yeah Carson above Lake City\nAnd I gather where you're headed next is that there are some ghost towns perhaps with minimal population but now lately abandoned that's right how did how was that it goes down in other words there are people there\nWell I think ghost town or is it has been applied to towns with people or maybe an Hollywood western movies got that term started and pretty much fits a towns of the old\nMining towns in the west but\nThere are ghost towns everywhere for many reasons as an example of when uh the interstate highway system was built in our country just come any towns all across the country that\nWere bypassed on the old us highways and many of them became ghost towns because they lost all their commerce\nTo the Disneyland so we like twelve years old and we go first right we get on is\nPirates of the Caribbean it's a little China cabinet that they had schools on my brother and I

or you know ... making comments that are that are in in my view I mean I don't know ... what do you think\nIt's a I think senator dial it was a little tone deaf with his language and he should be admonished for that\nAt the same time the point of his statement was to give credit an honor to the people who are who he was working with the point of Donald Trump's statements when he talks about the the caravan coming up from the south and sending five thousand troops to the border for something that's not even a crisis\nOr to to do that the point is there still fear in the American public and frankly to stoke racial animus and that is the thing that we cannot ignore so I don't get I don't say Donald Trump was responsible for the attack of a synagogue or for the pipe bombs\nBut now he knows what will car in ... when he when he sets the tone that he sets everything he has done since then will be his responsibility because he knows what can happen with the words when we\nJust wanna make sure that we've noted we I'm actually going to look at a Senate race and there are Democrats who are just ending soon distancing themselves from other\nDemocrats and let's take a look at that Missouri Senate race you've got Claire McCaskill up against state attorney General John Hi Josh Holly I hear is McCaskill on Fox News explaining why she's reading those radio ads and she talks about the crazy Democrat for listen\nDemocrats are people who walk in restaurants and scream and elected officials face is we have a state senator here in Missouri to actually advocated for the assassination of President Trump's crazy Democrat\nAnd give them all there are a many Republican voters and Trump supporters who are seeing groups of people protesting I'm going into restaurants and he kinda verbally assaulting people and they were feeling beleaguered and they are feeling under attack of Democrats you\nKnow they are such snowflakes [laughter]\nThey stood up which is where consider themselves candidate urban pubs are reluctant to public office and because constituents come up to them and complain about the problems that they see in the country and the and their complicity they are upset that has nothing to do someone yelling at your dinner is not commiserate with someone sending a pipe bombs are you in the mail or attacking us\nAnd somebody said he would say these people and accessible any other way\nYeah well look I I think that I I think anybody that shows up for a protest at an appropriate place is a great American they're they're they're taking their American right in their first matter right and they're doing something about it\nTo start physically and verbally at cost ... when they are in a private space not physically there has been many cases word has been used to take 'em out Trump supporters have been beaten and a lot of different places and I'm just saying\nI'm starting to wonder if some foreign agent and I say this and jazz but we're in ages as put something in the water where we've all gone crazy I don't think this is a Democrat or or really that as a Republican but\nThis new CPR news when you want to catch up on a lot of

about a young man who committed suicide in Las Vegas Jon ultimately submitted that essay to the San Francisco magazine the believer and that was launched a seven year holy war over facts\nThey got it in his his head facts could be fluent it was the impact of this story that mattered\nHis fact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a fat or wasn't and facts were sacred soon single produce Ninety pages of inaccuracies which the two\nTurned into a book with email exchanges like the following limited by our colleagues single questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John D'Agata said it was nine seconds but the car and said it was eight\nYeah fudge that doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them to fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the major themes in the essay work\nJohn changing details about stuff like Tabasco sauce bottles and thermometers is one thing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that relate directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming his fall took nine seconds for a while as parents also assume that he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so shouldn't change\nNine is to enter a part of the essay at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the essays not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play

feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I have to take him on there and just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in

tearing down a number of companies are reporting quarterly earnings this week in among all the data\nAbout profits in law says we're seeing something else some companies are beginning to raise prices Coca Cola showing Williams and Steve Martin a just a few household brand you may notice getting a bit more expensive and that news has some analysts worrying about inflation for the first time in years this spring\nReagan senior editor for Bloomberg News Mike Hi Robyn so we've been bracing for higher prices because of the task going into effect but we also have this robust economy can you first explain why raising prices often come hand in hand with an economy that gets too hot\n[noise] well it a lot of it goes to wages are as wage pressure picks up um that increases companies costs and to some degree they pass what they can on to consumers\nAnd one of the spots where it's really strong lately is in a transportation and freight uh there's more or less a shortage of truckers in this country in part because\nOf the strong labor market there's better opportunities or elsewhere and also there's you know new regulations that cut down on the amount of hours truckers can actually tried so that's a big part of it um that said it ... certainly are a big part is especially some of the examples you've cited a\nFor rising prices Coca Cola cited the cost of aluminum I'm a Home Depot was passing on a twenty percent increase in the price of washing machines to consumers and there's plenty of examples like that a to point to terrorists as well\nWell and they have some companies thinking about relocating Steve madness issue Comey said they might try to move operations out of China to avoid paying the duty so what what can we see an exodus of factories maybe going to Mexico which the whole hope was to bring them here right read I don't know about\nA mass exodus a ed Rosenfeld the CEO Steve Madden said something else he said we can't just flip a switch and move everything out of China and I think that's indicative of what it executives across the country are doing right now trying to determine\nIf these tariffs are a permanent thing or if maybe there's something that goes away with the new Congress or there's push back against President Trump so um they are looking at a option to other countries Steve Martin mentioned in addition to Mexico Brazil Italy Vietnam\nPortugal India maybe even Cambodia so it's certainly ... or something CEOs are looking at but it's it's a big deal to move your production out of a country country so ah I wouldn't expect it to happen overnight well\nBig airlines like delta and Jet Blue in American are raising prices they say fuel costs are up forty percent so what are we talking about here\nWell with the airlines um there are going to face some pressure in actually passing on those fuel costs to consumers because airlines have had an added a lot of capacity over recent years so it's a very competitive market\nSo the damage there will likely be more to airlines own profits rather than passing on a a hundred percent of the fuel costs on the consumers\nYou know the night just to make sure these underscore what we begin speaking about are you saying that American consumers are paying really as these prices go up to the terrorists that were led a to punish other countries [noise] yes many cases\nThey are you know not a surprise [laughter] yes as predicted by pretty much everyone in a lot of cases they are as you know\nLike we continue to him but news\nThank you so much like your oven it's here

happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had\nNational international and local news tomorrow\nOn MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nice because one state Nebraska does not have both the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\n[noise] well well what the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really\nHad a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes uh they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policy making on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans an edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nThe lengthy says the

on the issues there are some differences on social issues but Walker is really downplayed social issues as governor and he's really focused on\nEconomic and non social issues so in practical terms there wasn't a lot of difference between the two of them and they were pretty evenly splitting the non Republican vote\nYeah but then when mullah made that comment it seemed to be um the time you make an exit look at just after Walker left the race in Alaska survey research full had done levy the Republican up only four points than higher so uh talk about how this racist changed\n[noise] yeah so a challenge for baggage is that Walker's name is still on the ballot even though he suspended his campaign it happened after the withdrawal deadline and there isn't a lot of precedence for having an incumbent governor name on the ballot and then not campaigning\nSo as you could imagine if you get five percent if he gets ten percent that's largely going to be votes coming out of\nBaggage is likely voters an enemy got those that's just because people either aren't informed about the latest news or they really like Walker and they don't like the other two names on the ballot\nYeah well so that

B. U. R. I'm Jeremy hops and if Democrats take back control of the house of representatives next Tuesday one of their priorities will be taking on big pharma so what might happen to drug prices ... a reporter with our partners that stat the health and medicine publication he's with us from Washington high left\nThanks for having me and you report that house minority leader Nancy Pelosi has a plan to tackle drug prices and she has let pharmaceutical companies know about what is it\nYeah we reported yesterday that over the summer Nancy Pelosi walked into the the farm a board room which is a group of essentially of\nVery powerful drug company executives and made this threat essentially that talked about the government's right to in in extreme circumstances\nStrip drug companies of licenses to drugs that make them millions and millions of dollars a it's unlikely that the federal government would use that tool but what's notable as the tone with which Pelosi\nHas been talking to the pharmaceutical lobby\nIn the months before an election that's likely to make her speaker of the house again so a couple of the planks that her party has talked about include a allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices which is currently prohibited and another is the installation of a Senate confirmable price gouging enforcer\n... plan someone who would monitor drug companies for price hikes and if it's determined that the price hike is not from a business perspective justifiable the price gouging enforcer would be empowered to fine that company proportional to the price increase and give the money to the national the national institutes of health to use for research\nAnd big pharma is against that what about Republicans President Trump has talked a lot about trying to bring down drug prices would he be on board with this idea or do they have ideas of their own to bring down drug prices\nThe idea of this strange bedfellows alliance between Donald Trump's White house and Nancy Pelosi's house of representatives is is certainly an alarming prospect to the pharmaceutical industry here in DC\nIt's unclear whether Republicans in the house and especially Republicans in the Senate they're likely to keep control of that chamber would go along with any of ... proposals in fact it's it's likely that a lot of the house proposals that Democrats approve\nCould could be dead on arrival in the Senate but if all of a sudden the Trump Administration and Alex days are the health secretary\nAre willing to work with polo see on some of the more consensus proposals all of a sudden it could put a Republican controlled Senate in a bind and it could really put a lot of pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to to beat back a lot of these proposals\nBut it's not likely that the White House for instance would support something as old as as part D negotiation Trump had talked on the campaign trail before his election that allowing Medicare to negotiate prices appeared to be a no brainer has since backed off that pledge it's something Democrats are really hitting him hard for\nIt is it something you think that people are going to go out to the polls to vote and we know that health care is a big issue in general what about drug prices\nHealthcare is a big issue within it drug prices are a huge issue a lot of the pollsters I've talked to a lot of the folks and state parties around the country say that when they called voters and various legislative districts the high cost of prescription medicines is among the things they want government to address most in most urgently and\nAnother thing to bear in mind is that the Republican tax bill\nPassed last year is not particularly popular and one element within it that really riled up voters is the perception that pharmaceutical companies saved billions of dollars collectively from that tax cut which is true it's not a popular element of that tax bill\nThat has led faster at stat led thank you thanks very much

investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations Mueller's office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird but what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller\nAnd what may be the case that woman actually does not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges would unclear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr or is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that neither was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in a special counsel's office if it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI\nAnd well there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and jet Berkman who are said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat is right wall is the young men who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that is unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call\nThe crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office in mullet himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving putative misconduct by Mahler\nUm they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gay we pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent
