federal agents who have been tracking down the source of suspected letter bombs address this week to President Trump's political foes believe they have their man they have custody of says are say aka fifty six year old man from day to Florida he is a registered Republican\nFederal agents were seen today confiscating all white van near Davey Florida its windows covered with stickers and signs that support Trump and trash his enemies however it has yet to be independently verify that the van belongs to say on\nThe arrest followed the discovery this morning at at least three more suspicious packages that appear similar to the ones that dressed in nearly a dozen Democratic Party link targets\nWill President Trump says terrorizing acts have no place in the United states NPR's Scott Horsley reports Trump praise law enforcement for the swift arrest in these suspicious package case\nTrump like in the search for the would be bomber to finding a needle in a haystack and so the Saudis would spared no expense and their hunt for a suspect Trump vowed to prosecute whoever is responsible for sending suspicious packages to the fullest extent law\nMuch never allow political violence to take

saying American should show the world they're United in peace love and harmony Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\nDemocrats have opened up a lead in the race for control of Congress according to a new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll and fears of medical Montenegro has the details\nWhen voters were asked whether they're planning to cast their ballot for a Democrat or Republican in their district November six fifty percent said the Democrat while forty percent said they plan to cast their vote for Republican\nThat ten point gap is an increase from six points earlier this month and seen as a significant advantage as Democrats are making a push to take back the house to medical mountain Arnold NPR News Washington\nBurials are being held today in Jordan for some of the twenty people killed this week and flash floods reporting from Amman NPR's Chana wraps as many of the victims were schoolchildren who were on a class trip to the debt see\nPolice officials say a bus carrying forty four

looking for bodies and survivors that included several other people visiting a valley with hot springs families on friday began burying the dead Jordanian flags flew at half staff\nI I think that the reason he talks on national security is because it makes it more likely that that would be an okay thing to do ... as it relates to an executive order unilaterally without needing to bring in Congress\nFor anything like that and what to White House officials told NPR's Tamara Keith is that the administration is considering a wide range of administrative\nLegal and legislative options to address the quote Democrat created crisis of ... illegal immigration\nNo decisions have made it this time nor will we forecast to smugglers or caravans what precise strategies will or will not be deployed so they're not denying that it's a possibility a but there are certainly not saying that anything is finalized this\nPoint oh this very interesting eleven days from the mid terms I Know there is an NPR PBS Marist Poll out today that basically says this election will very much be about Donald Trump what else do we know\nAbsolutely two thirds of Americans say that Donald Trump will be a factor in his in their votes sixty seven percent of people now the reason that's important you can always say well you know president of course that's what the main thing is that people are voting on a ... and you look back to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nOnly forty seven percent of people twenty points lower said that\nA President Obama was a factor in their vote\nAnd in fact this time around a more people almost half say that President Trump's their impression of President Trump makes them more likely to vote for Democrats as compared to in twenty fourteen when I'm a slightly lower number said that their impressions of President Obama made it more likely for them to vote for a Republican\nAnd remember that's a year that Republicans took back the Senate so that's one finding in their women especially suburban women women or live in the suburbs\nUh say that Trump is not just a minor factor he that he is a major factor in their vote and people who say that he's a major factor are twice as likely to go and vote for a Democrat so\nWe're seeing the floor of this election rising a lot of potential turnout or could be the highest in fifty to a hundred years or which is kinda fascinating\nAnd you're seeing a lot of the opposition to President Trump being driven by women in particular white college educated women uh when Republicans are hoping that the good economy will help them and hold onto a maybe\nEven make gains in the Senate and well the president is a it has got to really full schedule a head because he's going to go to Penn rallies apparently this coming week sometimes to a day in two different states we've also been seeing big policy proposals on prescription drugs on immigration as we said\nUh what do you make me wonder ... how the president is approaching big issues in these final days\nWell in fact the matter is Republicans have been saying to me for months that they that no single issue has been able to break through they really side uh they they took a heavy sigh of relief when the cabinet confirmation hearing seemed to raise Republican enthusiasm that seems to have faded now when we looked at our polling\nAnd in fact tax cuts you know the thing that a lot of Republicans really were hanging their hat on thinking that this is going to be the thing a lot of people are going to like not regularly right not resonate only eleven percent of people in our poll said that it's a factor in their vote\nBy the way more people said that they that it made them more likely to vote for a Democrat tax cuts then for Republican and one more point on that\nIs that when Mitch McConnell says that it's not a Republican problem or the the deepening fiscal um the deepening of federal deficit that he'd like to try to cut entitlements well sixty percent of Americans actually said that you'd rather roll back those tax cuts than touch Medicare Medicaid\nOr Social Security eleven days ago a lot of time between now and

Mullen\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie or tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nNPR's identifying him as Caesar say he's fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast and also charge in two thousand two\nFor a threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a bankruptcy in his past and we also know he's a registered Republican you\nSaid that he has a disparate long criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nWe are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors and others about what exactly are led authorities to this man so quickly this is a remarkably swift investigation is President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether this suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode was one of the big question leading up to this arrest or was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that's something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it and not handle it call authorities and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber\nOr wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play and has making these devices\nAre once again we're talking to NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings that's happening at the bottom of the hour carry the arrest do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in this right now we know that Cesar ... is the only person in federal custody I think the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspect because of course there were images\nNow he's got to do something that brings the country together\nMaybe he called the leadership of the house and Senate and bring them together and how to talk with\nAt least he said call his predecessors Brock Obama and Bill Clinton and talk to them and make sure they're OK and let them know the old way of course the government is going to make sure they're protected but he knew he calls George Soros is the president as it's called ... that I'm going to make sure you're protected\nThat what's in such a signal to every one of the country that this is not about politics but he's not doing that\nWe've been speaking to democratic strategist and hosted he'll TV Jamal Simmons drawl I Know that you need to get going so we will say goodbye to you now thank you very much for speaking with us and then Republican strategist Alex Stewart please a standby if you will because they want to bring in\nA loop William hunt too is a former FBI special agent\nAnd he now teaches in the criminal Justice Department at Radford University in Virginia or Mr ... thank you for joining us we have a suspect oh what are your initial thoughts now that some of the information is emerging about who this\nShow Oh thanks for having had early on and so I'm the first thing that law enforcement are going to want to do is secure the scene I'm you know is there any threat to life are there any um leads the need to be covered and the one big question is are others involved\nA so orange to secure a search or you can get into this person's house business big goals and really track these things down and see if there is other places on it to be\nHow do you think ah from your best guess you don't have every chicken this investigation but how do you think investigators got to this suspect so quickly\n[noise] yeah it it varies in every case but there there's there's always going to be a lot of forensic evidence when you're involved when you're working on this many um bombed devices\nThe other thing that we see in cases like this um if there's any um video coverage of where the person may have dropped these packages off\nUm sometimes you know the person gets caught him but it we see that in recent a bomb or bother tax what I'm getting some feedback on myself so it's a little bit a little bit to us\nFrom many sorry we'll see if we can do something about that Mr hunter I Wonder if you when you think about whether or not this man was acting alone what else he said to look around his home what other clues do you look for it and try and find out if he was acting alone or if they're on these with him\nYeah that's a ... so the first thing you can do is when you get a search warrant you can get into his of arbiters house you're going to secure all of the computer um evidence so what kind of email records are there what kind of computer records ... who is associated says if you are talking what you're able to check sell some of those\nAnything like that um then you can start interviewing a neighbors friends associates someone they know something someone may have heard something someone may have seen something and then the real question is how much did they know and what are they involved so all of those things are happening\nRight now probably simultaneously and there's a probably a decent chance that someone did do something in in a case like this\nOne kind of I'm Sorry oh what kind of clues from the packages themselves will investigators be looking for\n[noise] well I'm a couple of things I mean you you you want to see the kind of components\nThat we're using this sort of a device so that might lead I'm a investigators to the location where these things were purchased and so for example if you find out where these component to purchase you might have additional surveillance a video\nAnd perhaps this person was accompanied by someone when they went and purchase these parts that's a that's a ... a one example and then when you send all the arts off to the lab at Quantico FBI ... will likely do that again you may get additional friends ditch\nBigger print any sort of DNA those kinds of things could all be uncovered from these many many devices so there's really I'm a huge sort a source of evidence that has to be called through by investigators\nOnce again we're waiting for attorney general Jeff Sessions and a whole slate\nOf law enforcement officials from ATF from U.S Postal inspection service to speak at the Justice Department about the Iraq Today I'm fifty six year old man in Florida\nIn the in a in a male bombings that have taken place over the past week I Wonder when you listen to them yourself a wish me remember William Hunter former FBI smashing region I Wonder what you were going to be listening for in particular when what teams do you think there will be a news conference\nWell I I mean I think there are a couple of things so so the first thing that I think I'm at a press ... going to want to hear is is are there any other outstanding threats I mean there there could be other devices that were said oh we certainly hope there there's not we want to make sure that everything is safe so that's the first thing um\nOr the other thing is I mean everyone's got to be wondering about a motive and I don't know that we're going to um have\nThat information yet because it's an ongoing acted investigation but that's the big\nUm um piece of the puzzle here that people are are obviously wanting a to to find out and and ... will have to see whether we get any clues about um that sort of thing\nLuke William hunt former FBI special agents I Want to ask you one more question before I ask you a to hang tight\nOr what your thoughts on the fact that these devices never exploded not one of them does it is it assigned to you that this suspect was a bad bomb maker or that but you know he he didn't want them to explode\nWell um [noise] yeah you know this is this is a lot of uh\nCompletely uncommon ... and one thing that you see what this kind of thing is just sort of jumped to sort of terrorize people um even if you have someone who's not capable\nOf actually creating a an active devices going to explode a this is obviously a way to terrorize people are just sort of get back\nAt the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's such a probably the the the big\nI'm a motivation there\nOkay hang was with us if you can uh NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions\nThe FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think this individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office\nHas been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service in somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderous row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department answer unanswered questions\nDid he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed to package\nAnd there may be other such devices out there we've got to find that out law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go off or detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything ask for motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old she's there say are from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been to address the use of e suspicious packages and that's one hand tests to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand our thirties the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned that a democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mailed to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California\nHe says we're thankful every one we work with\nIs safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident and Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",
