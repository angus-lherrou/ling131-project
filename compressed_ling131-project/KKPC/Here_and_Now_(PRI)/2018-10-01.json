Trump is celebrating what he calls the biggest trade deal in us history NPR's Scott Horsley reports the updated agreement with Mexico and Canada could get a boost to American dairy farmers and auto workers\nThe deal amounts to a rewrite of the quarter century old NAFTA agreement which President Trump is often criticized it gives American dairy farmers new access to the Canadian market and is designed to encourage more auto production in the United states more auto parts\nAnd automobiles will be manufactures inside the United states we will be manufacturing many more cars\nWith the White House deadline approaching candidates signed on to the deal late Sunday night the agreement leaves in place for now us tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as well as the retaliatory tariffs the Canada and Mexico imposed and response Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nThe White House has released a memo analyzing the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford by the prosecutor who questioned her before the Senate last week NPR's Kelsey Snell reports that sex crimes specialist Rachel Mitchell says she believes forwards accusations would create a weak case\nThe nephew to share Committee Republican hired Mitchell to a question for Dr accusation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her more than Thirty years ago in the no no matter if as she does not being a reasonable prosecutor would bring a case based on the evidence for present it\nForward identified witnesses who either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate that she also says sports lack of details about the party where she alleges the attack took place undermined her claim\nThe FBI is now investigating fourth accusation against cabinet and another accuser who had come forward in recent weeks Kelsey Snell NPR News Washington\nTropical storm Rosa is no longer a hurricane bond is still a serious whether a threat for a large portion of the U.S southwest senior hurricane specialist Richard passion with the national Hurricane Center\nThe main threat from Rosa is not to win but rather the rain and it's going to bring very heavy rains to portions of north central Baja California state of slow in Sonora Mexico and the desert southwest software she noted states\nHe says the storm is already producing dredging downpours\nWe expect a rainfall totals to be as high as six inches in some isolated areas and this is going to produce um some Syria flash flooding\nAh but then different sectors react differently because there are winners and losers as there are others who she is sort of a status quo that would probably describes the majority of people\nAre there's relief in the auto sector there's a little bit of dismay and the dairy sector\nAnd that sort of what we expected what do you not know about this deal yet that you'd like to know\n[noise] well there are a lot of questions about the terrorists that have been put on Canada outside of NAFTA those national security terrorists that upset every ... wells steel and aluminum and of course then there was also a threat for cars and trucks now\nAs a result of this arrangement us MCA it seems that the threat of tariffs on Canadian cars and trucks will go away that would have been a real killer blown Trump called it the mother lode\nOr last week in the news conference in the in the a lot palace hotel in New York but the feeling tired still limits are ... are going to stay in place to us is insisting oh that's not part of NAFTA that's a separate track Canada's hoping that this investigation by the U.S department of commerce will have concluded by the time this deal is actually signed\nAnd they will have come to the conclusion to Canada is not a national security threat to the United states and that those terrorists will then be\nLifted anyway but it's pretty odd to be going into a new trade agreement with\nEach country having sixty billion dollars worth of tariffs against the other end in the case of the U.S you know literally describing Canada's national security threat and that as much as the dollar amount as certainly annoyed people in Canada\nWell let me finally ask you about that than they did this negotiation has been pretty ugly between a President Trump and Justin Trudeau the Canadian prime minister\nI did notice that the name of disagreement is the United states Mexico Canada agreement with Canada last even though alphabetically it would be first [laughter] yeah or even a second I mean what do you think this has done to the relationship between the U.S and Canada\nWell on the day first of all I must say I was in that news conference in New York last weekend Donald Trump was talking about he likes to the U.S embassy because it's down sounds like US marine corps right so this is the name of the agreement probably doesn't mean that much because\nHe had already said that when there was a bilateral deal between the U.S and Mexico was going to be the U.S and so now Canada the third to sign on it's sort of follows I suppose that it would have its name at the end here people are not focused on this medics nobody really cares about that you can call it whatever he wants\nBut with the relationship in general uh yes this has been seen in Canada as an exercise you know arm twisting and bullying a there has been a lot of misinformation put out by the White House including the the basic claim that there's a deficit with Canada which is simply not true U.S Department of commerce figures show that that is not true\nThis is a balance of trade relationship in which there's actually a slight surplus for the U.S with goods and services over Canada one of only two countries in the world I Believe the U.S has a surplus with is Canada\nSo candidate did not understand why it was called on to make all these concessions and uh it you know was surprised actually when Donald Trump campaigned against Mexico and then govern that seemed turning his attention more on Canada making a deal first with Mexico which is a low wage environments\nUh and and really putting that putting the screws to Canada so will there be lasting damage you know I don't know I mean the Canadians take a dim view generally if the Trump Administration after Donald Trump is gone will that linger on\nIt's always difficult being the smaller neighbor dealing with a a big country like the U.S and you sometimes you just have to learn to roll with the punches and in this case I guess preserving NAFTA meant just kind of going along with certain things that you've dealt were unfair or if for the greater\nThe BCS Evan dire joining us from Ottawa Evan thank you\nThanks Jeremy you're listening to hear now [noise]\n\nThere's the chance for rain today around Denver than

and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr posters welcome and congrats to you and your colleagues on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer in\nHis a main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells\nAnd those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments are sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to insides and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associated with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolve including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty

Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump has announced the completion of a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico we get more now from NPR's Mara Liasson\nIn a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House President Trump said he successfully negotiated determination and replacement of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement he says he has a new pact that he's named the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nSome of the terms of the new agreement are significant others are minor but President Trump says once the deal is ratified by Congress hundreds of thousands of new jobs will begin pouring into the country Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nAfter announcing the new trade deals President Trump answered reporters' questions about the FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh president is disputing claims that the scope of the pro is being limited\nI think the fashion interview anybody that they want within reason\nBut you have to stay within reason they should interview but they should also be guided and I'm being guided by

been used to treat the bone thinning disease osteoporosis but there's been a big debate about whether it might help prevent factors in people it earlier stages of bone loss\nThat are his supporters gonna view it that way or is this a win as far as they're concerned\nYeah I mean if if his supporters of dairy farmers they're going to be happy for supporters work in the car manufacturing industry I'm sure they're going to be happy I'm you know in terms of the biggest losers here it's not yet entirely clear I think that people who support Donald Trump\nIt has been shown in poll after poll they basically support him no matter what\nAnd this isn't a bad trade deal it's it's a it's a fine trade deal it's just extremely subtle compared with the criticisms that Trump had for the previous trade deal and it should be said that in twenty sixteen as a part of the TPP ah negotiations the Trans Pacific partnership\nNegotiations Obama's team was negotiating with Canada and Mexico and actually extracted\nMany of the exact same benefits that Trump has now extracted from those countries in twenty Eighteen and so I think the confusion here for a lot of economists say if you're going to take Trump's seriously when he criticizes NAFTA and when he pulled out of TPP if you did in his first week as president is\nIf your if there was all this bluster about how bad these trade agreements are and then two years later you're basically just reenacting them and putting a new name on it than what exactly we've been talking about for the last year and a half\nWell what does it mean for the manufacturing industry in this country which President Trump has been focused on since before he became president he's been telling people and a lot of states in the Midwest especially that you know we're going to bring your jobs back we're going to the manufacturing industry in this country is going to boom again\nRight on the one hand it's important to hit the steel tariffs remain in place\nOr they might open up more negotiations in the future with Canada ... but for now the steel tariffs remain in place and that's something that the steel manufacturing industry quite likes but whenever we're talking about manufacturing it's important to say let's define what a comeback is in Nineteen Seventy nine there were twenty million manufacturing workers\nWhen Trump became president there were twelve point three million now there's twelve point seven million right so we've added four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in the last Eighteen months that's not bad manufacturing jobs are coming back but we're never going to have anything close to the Nineteen seventies economy again\nAnd so you know when I talk to economists about you know how do you plan the economy the future they say well planned for the economy\nOf the future don't try to create the conditions to to grasp for the economy that we had in Nineteen Seventy nine and so it just seems like there's an enormous amount of effort being placed on creating conditions for the revitalization of a tiny tiny part of the U.S economy which isn't steel manufacturing\nWhen in fact we were just in Indiana a recently doing some reporting on manufacturing there and one of the problems that they say that they have in the industry there is that we've got the jobs we just don't have workers that are trained to do\nThe new

his tray strategy is working that might embolden him to hold out on China\nUm it might I'm old enough to hold on the European Union as well on the other hand if you take the outcome of this negotiation on his face and you said Trump is going to have a lot of bluster there's going to be a lot of criticism of the status quo but you're going to end up with\nThe status quo I mean to be clear us MCA not to a to point out whatever you call it it's basically exactly what the Obama administration had a toward the end of twenty sixteen and so if that's your precedent then you're going to and you're going to have a lot of last year but ended up essentially where we were\nTwo years there Thompson senior editor at the Atlantic thank you thank you it's here and [noise]\nThere's the chance for
