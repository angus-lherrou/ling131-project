school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court has some ugly consequences Sarah Verizon has a child of parents who came to the U.S from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school if you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller [laughter] so [laughter] you should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um ... is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and heat you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was in the ... right right yeah so ... yeah and has sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who sent it his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid\nAnd so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right\n[laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to know kid should really have to did you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSure it looks like a two stories are in one case a trainer at Sea World was killed by a whale\nAnd the DC circuit court found that the world was liable for ignoring specific warnings about this particular animal is particular whale\nKavanaugh descended he said that working with large animals was inherently dangerous it was like stock car racing and therefore SeaWorld shouldn't be liable to be clear that was a defense so he disagreed with the majority at the DC circuit level there's another case where a black Jamaican FBI employee\nSuit his bosses for illegal discrimination\nAnd Kavanaugh said that he was reelected reluctant excuse me to second guess\nThe FBI's national security decisions so again in both of these cases wanted SeaWorld another death at the FBI very very different institutions but in both cases he found that uh there was a way to protect the employers decision and find a way to rule against the employee the employees a suit\nTell us more about his stance on workers on organized labor and workplace protections\nSure well you mentioned the constitutional accountability center or they published a relief thorough document finding that as the DC circuit court has heard all sorts of appeals ... specifically those involving the larvae that's an agency that enforces\nFederal labor laws then in case after case they said quote cabinet has sided with employers against their employees in all these types of cases\nAnd so they specifically found I Believe Seventy five particular cases in which he found ways to rule for the employer in against the employees some of those included cases like you know the the the real case and the FBI cases I just mentioned\nAnd she said well you know eight in place in us within the broader context\nIt's not as though Kavanaugh is a pro employer justice and joining a a a Supreme Court disagrees with him in fact the Roberts Court\nContinues a decades long trend of being a pro corporate court or the last Supreme Court term was ruled the most business friendly and modern memory according to the same institution the constitutional accountability center or to be clear that's it's progressive public interest law firm\nUm but this is clearly a case where the Supreme Court ah is which has been consistently drifting towards ... corporate uh rulings a sense of Nineteen seventies will continue that trend in the future\nAnd bring the environment into this in the case last year Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion saying the EPA could not require companies to use more environmentally friendly alternatives to refrigerant chemicals what more do we know about his take on environmental regulation\nWell we he's ruled against the EPA or pollution rules pretty consistently uh one of the case you mentioned there another where he ruled a\nVet a upstream polluters shouldn't be held liable for downstream pollution or so it's really just a case of of exactly what we're talking about in terms of being all our be again it for for the EPA cabinet I think\nA ... faced a lot of scrutiny about his private life or in in the past few hearings with the Senate um there's been a lot of focus about his private life or as before he's been confirmed\nBut I think what we're going to see is that his legacy is going to be really really strong maybe not so specifically on on roe versus Wade is not entirely clear how he's going to rule on that issue but he's been very very clear about his stance on property rights in his stance on the degree to which\nRegulators can ah can enact a kind of control over employers to protect unions to protect the way that people are due collective bargaining in this country and that's where I think the cabinet legacy is going to be most clearly felt from the ...\nJust briefly um to finish up political says the Supreme Court is on a hot streak for business interests uh there was a big decision that went against the public sector unions you mentioned in the spring how do these past couple of terms compared to previous years\nYeah so basically what what what the what the conscious of accountability center does is they've gone back through history and they looked at what percent of the Supreme Court cases are they siding with the pro corporate chamber of commerce\nAre back in uh the Berger court it was about it was less than fifty percent now they find that they're starting with the chamber of commerce in more than two thirds of cases this is a pro corporate Supreme Court that is about to become even more for\nThey keep their accounts and

book\nThat gives you an indication of the nature of the country that China is they\nFeel that they can detaining the law says that they can detain even detain they date and on what grounds\nWell on suspicion of taking bribes book as in the United states and Western Europe you might have to explain exactly what grounds you half a detainee somebody sent me in Britain you would have to go before a judge and explain why he wanted to keep somebody in custody you have to go through the evidence you had against him\nNone of that applies in China the law says they can help for a particularly long

were guilty of something or a court case having being ... but anybody living in the ... used to our procedures and it seems very very strange in China each know is there\nAny evidence or at least evidence that the outside world might respect I'm supporting China's claims that this man is corrupt and was carrying out bribery\nIt just simply no way to assess any evidence which has been leveled against them home way because we don't know exactly what he's being charged wave on wave he's being held at the moment quite interesting the the ministry of public security issued a statement\nAbout I'm not home way at on Monday which they explain they were holding him and\nIt was quite a confusing statement but in that they said that the decision to investigating was wise to act and timely the

unsolved art heist in history listen on apple podcast\nThis is here and now from NPR and W. B. U. R. I. Lisa Mullen's the people's bank of China announced yesterday that it will reduce the amount of reserves commercial banks are required to hold by one percentage point\nThe move freeze up banks to lend up to one hundred Seventy five billion dollars to Chinese borrowers there's a scene is China's latest attempt to spur growth in the face of biting tariffs from the Trump Administration\nSome analysts have characterized those tariffs as impulsive but there are now some people who think they may be a part of a grand us strategy toward China\nAre going to talk about that now with Jill lessons or she's business analyst for CBS News\nAnd who's to Jill on money her podcast is better off hello Jill hello so first to telling stats are stocks in Shanghai of fallen Fifteen Percent since the beginning of this year\nAnd China's currency as we can nine percent against the u._s. dollar so there are signs that the Chinese economy is indeed vulnerable uh the Chinese Communist party derives its legitimacy from continuing economic growth so how much is that growth and the legitimacy in jeopardy now well\nWhat the Chinese economy which is a ... trillion dollar economy the second largest in the world\nIs still going to grow this year probably by around let's call it six and a half percent or so but a lot of problems at the country has faced predate the Trump administration's tariffs we know that\nThe manufacturing sector has certainly been hit recently\nBut the you know we've seen the pace of expansion of investment in houses in factories and railroads a key driver to of Chinese goods has actually fallen and and that was happening before the terrorists\nAt what we're seeing in this action by the government is an attempt to spur economic growth but also to make sure that everyone knows they still have a little gunpowder left\nAnd that the Chinese economy is not going to ... butter out of control without the government being involved it\nSeems as though the Trump administration's goal is to weaken China as much as they can but I Wonder how different things are from the Obama era the current White House uses a lot more bellicose language uh whereas back then Brock Obama called U.S China strategy a pivot at the core though isn't the goal continuing to try to stop China's rise\nI I don't know if it's to stop the rise I Do think that both administrations share one core belief and that is\nThat you know they want China to actually continue modernizing its economy but they are not so clear that they like these business in trade practices which essentially\nSaid to the United states and the company's base in the United states come on cell you're good cheer you can operate but you're going to have to cough up your technology or go into a joint venture with the Chinese company so I don't think that we're trying to stop China I think we're trying to make the Chinese trade practices\nFairer and I think that has been consistent over the last dozen or so years and how effective is it\nWell you know right now we don't know and and I think that these trade tariffs have become really problematic\nOn in in essence because they start sparking other conversations we we hear Chinese officials saying hey you know you want to be really tough you want to start putting more terrorist another two hundred and fifty seven billion dollars of good will don't forget we're the key to North Korea\nSo this isn't just a trade issue it's a power issue and it does appear that the Trump Administration is trying to throw a wage and they're getting allies on one side all lined up with new trade policies and enforcing the allies to kind of come with the U.S and freeze out China\nAnd try to really agitate for more reform we don't know whether it's going to be successful or not but it does seem to be a bit\nMore strategic than initially thought Joe ... business analyst for CBS News and host of Jill on money always nice to have you
