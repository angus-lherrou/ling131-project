the head of law enforcement and their ability to understand who is the next bomber or shooter or killer that we're going to encounter in this country\nExactly and these crimes have become politicized as you well know there were asking questions about the political rhetoric in this country who and if it bears some responsibility for the violence that we've been saying do you think that way down the

here every day but of course the challenges for both citizens and politicians to come to some understanding that words can incite violence\nAnd that when whatever party one represents a if you suggest

latest one\nWell I mean listen to the energy difference between those two of you know talk so Suzanne by this president when on script and he's given the words in front of him to read how he you know should sound presidential\nThen he goes and does that but you know listen to how these egged on there by the crowd that's the energy that's what's fuel and that's what he thrives in and\nHe understands the difference within himself that you know remember during the campaign he said I\nCould be so presidential I'd be so boring doesn't want to be that guy and that and he's going to do everything possible to sort of fight doing that he has this habit of speaking out of two sides of that his supporters can say look he said the thing you want what else do you what else are you\nLooking for I also want to ask you about a theme that's been running through these past few days and it's anti Semitic conspiracy theories the mail bomb suspect sent one of his packages to George Soros the billionaire who's regularly a target of hate speech\nThere have been a number of conspiracy theories about Soros including that he's funding the migrant caravan and Central America I'm as we just heard from the last segment the Pittsburgh shooter has echoed this idea he cleaned on line that the Jews were responsible for the care of and\nWhat do you make of these theories making an appearance in both of these stories and increasingly them in the mainstream political\nDiscourse well it's always been something out there and sort of the dark Web than in places you know where people are routinely harassed and it's something that Trump the White House his campaign shouldn't be sensitive to you know whether inadvertently are deliberately during the campaign they\nAh you know wound up re tweeting white nationalist eye and instead this president\nDoubles down and you know when he feel what they're sensitive to and what she's sensitive to is how the president is treated and perceived and you know they were now pivoting to the strong man I was saying that he is not anti Semitic well that's not really what we're talking about it's not about him this is about uh how the message is received\nWe're eight days now from the midterms how does all this play into people's minds that head to the ballot box or to or does it at all\nWell Democrats are certainly playing up Trump's rhetoric and warning against a incivility in public life of course vice president Pence\nUh he was on a Sunday show this week and he was a arguing that the rhetoric is bad overall that Democrats say things that are bad to uh and that he had a different style that President Trump But Trump's provocative style is exactly how he connected to the American people I think that gives a degree of cover\nTo Trump's supporters to say you know look this is just something that ginned up by the left and the media\nNow one more thing I Want to ask you about before we let you go we heard from Hillary Clinton or in an interview with Recode a when asked about whether she would run in twenty twenty or her answer was I'd like to be president I'm kind of remarkable because you could you really be considering the summit go\nWell I think she would like to be president [laughter] you know I'm not surprised by anything anymore in politics lots of people say they're not going to run than they reconsider it if there was a groundswell of support for Hillary Clinton I'm sure she would consider it and I'm sure that looking at the twenty ... twenty twenty potential twenty twenty democratic field it's not a great\nField of candidates as far as understanding who there is no I shouldn't say that I should say that there is not exactly clear who the potential candidate\nCould be who would

B. U. R. I'm Robyn Young it's here and now there are still more volatility on the stock market today would suggest some investors are already worried about twenty Nineteen terrorists and the Federal Reserve's actions to increase interest rates all loom large\nBut the biggest cause for concern is that the booze from President Trump's tax cuts\nSeem to be over just messenger is business analyst with CBS News host of Jill on money and her pod cast better off I Jill hello so those tax cuts you know did make people better off the juice the economy this year on track to have the best year growth since two thousand five\nBut ... why you know why doesn't it last\nYou know I think that the the big focus of the tax cuts this year obviously was on the corporate side those were the ones that were the permanent tax cut the wrong way bigger much more of the tax cut power went to companies\nAnd companies did go out and spend money and also bought back a lot of their stock and gave a bunch of dividends but they spent money it looks like\nThat spending may have peaked in the second quarter\nAnd now it does look as though\nThe global growth is kind of softening of bit we know China's cooling we saw some numbers today out from the government that personal incomes were just up a little bit in September that suggests that perhaps we are now peaking with consumer spending all this is kind of freaking out the investment community and making people look at twenty Nineteen\nAs genes that may be a year where we're not going to see this three or three plus percent\nGrowth and again that because we understood the chocolate ... thought that these cuts would change company's long term behavior that I'm cutting that corporate income tax would make investing is so attractive that money would come in from these corporations and from overseas but it's not\nNo I mean look there's part of this is that companies are long term but they're not crazy either they want to see what's going on in the economy but I think we should layer on top of that there was quite a bit of uncertainty throughout this year around tariffs we had the aluminum and steel terrorists still in place the solar panels of washing machines\nAnd this unresolved issue with China is looming quite large remember George at fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods we have terrorists in place those terrorists could rise from ten to twenty five percent in January\nAnd we also I hate to say this word because we haven't talked about it in a while but we have a lot of uncertainty around ... and that has really prevent that a lot of companies for making major commitments to there's more information\nAnd these tax cuts have piled on the deficit um they're expected to reach a trillion one trillion next year\nYou know Mitch McConnell the Republican leader talked about how the tax you know this is a definite increase was because of huge spending and Medicare and Social Security and saying that they had to be cuts to that to offset the um the the debt others are are saying it's a tax cut would expect any of the economic consequences\nWell I mean look I'm not one of these people who I interviewed tons of economists all the times and some of them are people who think that that's the to the worst thing in the world I don't think that death is are the worst thing in the world however it is mildly annoying that you have\nSomeone like McConnell start to blame the social safety net programs for a deficit one corporate tax receipts based on the left deficit numbers corporate tax receipts were down by thirty one percent\nSo yeah there is truth that the bulk of the money that goes out of the budget has to do with the safety net programs but the big change in the deficit came because of corporate tax real quick you know we got twenty seconds can these be rolled back uh probably not because he really would need to see a big gains for the Democrats in\nThe Congress and we don't have a a a veto
