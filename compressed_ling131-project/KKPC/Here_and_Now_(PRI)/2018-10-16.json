know I think that these were two very driven people and certainly Bill Gates at the time and a subsequent to Paul Allen's departure was building an empire and I think Paul Allen his personality was a little bit more\nThoughtful and already thinking about philanthropies and his impact on the world especially having spoken with him about this I Know that that first cancer diagnosis was extremely formative for him it made him reassess his life\nAnd think about the broader impact that he would have long term and I don't think Bill Gates was quite there at that point yet\nBut in recent days I mean we see Bill Gates statement about Paul Allen he's being very nice about it today he certainly\nIs and there have been reports since the release of idea man in twenty eleven that the two have repaired their relationship\nI can tell you at the time in two thousand eleven there was definitely a divide between them over many of the things that Paul Allen wrote a book but reports that we started that they've conducted since then and appear to have mended their relationship\nYou mentioned that we've all got a computer in our pocket these days what Paul Allen sake of technology today\nHe was extremely optimistic in fact one of the many things that she created in Seattle was an Institute called the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence to in addition to the Allen

technologies startups new kinds of Institute and commercial space venture called strata launch\nPlans to watch rockets into the stratosphere and beyond from what will be the world's largest airplanes so this was a man whose ambition and hope for the future clearly persisted until the end of his life\nJust finally a thought about him you interviewed him many times\nYes I've interviewed him at least twice in the privacy was remarkable I interviewed him at town hall of a large venue here in Seattle in two thousand eleven and I remember after meeting and backstage we had to walk up to the stage\nAnd there was not a facility to do it in a way that he could navigate by going back seats we had to sort of walk up the side of the crowd and he was extremely nervous about interacting with the

Riyadh Michelle what more do we know about compounds meetings with the Saudi leaders\nNot much you know he's been very tight lipped about this whole idea you know the Saudis seem to be changing their story but U.S officials traveling with ... really don't want to say much until he has all of his meetings and that includes a\nMuch longer dinner tonight with um the crown prince who's been kind of a key figure in all of\nThis well when we we spoke about this yesterday we learned that the talk in the region is of this road killer that might have been in the ... that's what many Saudis are hearing President Trump a mentioned that after his conversation with the king yesterday are you hearing I mean what are you hearing people there say\nThe Saudi um media has been focused on one narrative so it'll be interesting if they actually do switch the narrative completely around here how people here react to the news\nThe U.S government is you know wants to hear the whole story and here it face to face rather than just on the phone and just\nThrough the media before they make any determination I mean they're not even telling us if they believe what they're hearing or whether anyone should believe what they're hearing from the Saudis on this\nOne of the reports from CNN and the New York times that the Saudis are preparing for what may ultimately be the truth is oh it was a deaths that occurred during a botched interrogation which of course\nThat doesn't sound like an interrogation it sounds like you know torture if someone dies during it um the princes newly ascendant you know in his leadership role there is reporting that it might have been an intelligence officer trying to impress him\nWhat are you hearing in response to that record and well you know it's it's not only this ah Robin but you know the the there's been a lot of things happening in this country where you have um women activists\nBeing jailed last year you had the Ritz Carlton turn into a prison of you know for Saudi princes caught up in these corruption crackdowns but it was so interesting watching secretary palm peyote because rather than coming in and and really you know demanding answers are being from\nAll you saw were smiles when he was there with um the king with the ah Saudi crown prince they just changed pleasantries if you didn't know that this was a time of real tensions are and are a real issue hanging over this it looked like any other visit that I've taken with the secretary of state\nWell that could be to try to smooth things over\nUm because it's such a delicate situation and explain why that is you know the president keeps referring to an arms deal which isn't really a deal it's sort of a promise of purchase of\nA of weapons by the Saudis but the Saudis are invested heavily elsewhere me why might the top of ministry shouldn't be tiptoeing around this well Saudi Arabia\nIs key to their regional goals and ambitions\nUm remember that a president came in talking tough about Iran and you know you still hear a secretary Pompeo focusing on Iran almost nonstop and not criticizing the Saudis and in that way at all\nUm their vote they pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal they're re imposing sanctions on Iran including oil sanctions\nThat go into effect in early November and they want the Saudis to continue to keep the oil markets table so you know for them this is a terrible time for something like this to happen as shocking as it is to the rest of the world\nYou know they need Saudi Arabia for that uh for the Iran deal they need Saudi Arabia for um the the Middle East peace deal that that Trump's son in law Jared Kushner has been working on Saudi Arabia is is a key to that as well so um you know this is\nA very delicate um dance for a secretary Pompeo to be to be doing because you know the president makes as already made it clear that he doesn't want to him up and the arms deal he doesn't want to go up and business relationships with the

minister ration announced the end of the program for Salvadorans but earlier this month a federal judge in California blocked that decision so while their fate plays out in court Salvadorans living here with temporary status can stay for now without fear of deportation\nBut WBRC Shannon dueling was recently in El Salvador and brings us the story of how families and communities there\nAnd in

Boston floors has lived in Massachusetts for almost Twenty years with TPS\nTemporary immigration status allows people from countries devastated by natural disasters or civil war to stay in the U.S without fear of deportation\nAnd since two thousand one when El Salvador was hit by back tobacco earthquakes TPS for that country has been regularly renewed until earlier this year when the Trump Administration announced the end of the program florists says it's hard to comprehend the thought of returning to El Salvador\nYou Steve Cole I never had time to us about\nMy own farm unity I just need that time to figure it out it's okay we have to make some decisions\nDecisions like does she leave behind her daughter her son and her grandchildren that she leaves behind her career working with the city of Somerville an estimated seven thousand Salvadorans living in New England with TPS are facing similar decisions\nDoesn't mind what are the reasons you came to this country but I think we had been demonstrating to the government we are hot or\nPeople with TPS are authorized to work in the U.S the center for American Progress estimates Salvadoran GPS holders pump more than four hundred

and bourbon needle quarter\nThat's Oscar ... executive director of ... America is an umbrella group of immigrant advocates\nHe says remittances money sent by Salvadorans living abroad primarily in the U. S.\nReplaced revenue from exports of sugar cane coffee and caution\nThese cash crops took a big hit during El Salvador's civil war in the eighties and early nineties the Salvadoran central bank now estimates that close to sixteen percent of the country's gross national income comes from remittances\nJust over five million dollars were sent back to El Salvador from the U.S last year that's up nearly ten percent from the year before so why the increase to cone points to the end of TPS\nCourt before Sandy out a few to the doctor they when they were able to keep spending more than you may be caught me to go out and\nPeople in El Salvador also fear the end of TPS send us an day as a small city about an hour's drive east of San Salvador that's where I'm a florist his mother\nIs about ... on the bakery the day we visit the afternoon humidity mixes with the aroma fresh baked bread floating in the air ... is wearing a red and white checked with a friend slicing pieces of homemade pesto they maintain and some meat that they do say\nShe stands behind steel bars while she works [noise] taking off her apron he sits down and explained why she her her daughter Flora never come back\nWith us is if there are trying to fight in the last five years\nOur situation here in our country isn't good there's a lot of crime there's extortion here close to the center of San ... is a little calmer but a little ways up there people are killed daily all of the businesses almost the majority are ...\nAt one point ... says she was doing out twenty five hundred US dollars in one day\nFive thousand US dollars another day she says young men were collecting the money for a local gang they've come in demand the payment and threatened to kill her if she didn't pay me I had dreams have growing her business and recently tried opening a second location but she says that sort of thing into possibility a\nSocialist I have the result was that on two occasions they assaulted me they tied me up they press their guns against me they took everything the value of money clothing everything so I had to close because the idea was to get ahead with the business but with the situation the way it is here\n[noise] no [noise] it's this sort of violence that concerns\nKeen than most when she thinks about her daughter returning to El Salvador she says gangs can tell when someone who's been living in the U. S. is back in town\nThe way they look their clothing their accent continues afraid her daughter would be an easy target the gang violence was not part of the calculation for the Trump Administration when it terminated the program\nInstead senior administration official said they focused only on country conditions related to the earthquakes that led to El Salvador's TPS\nBut that's a much more narrow reading of the TPS legislation than what's been used by past administrations\nImmigration law that Congress has enacted or some of the most generous in the world\nUs attorney general Jeff Sessions has echoed the sentiment on multiple occasions Massachusetts congressman Jim McGovern disagrees with this interpretation of temporary protected status McGovern who recently visited El Salvador says the emphasis was always meant to be placed on protected not temporary\nBack your German and give us an example of what you're talking about here how women inmates are punished more harshly\nThan men they get punished for the more minor violations of prison rules for non violent offenses in California we met a woman named Victoria Williams who talked well about just how\nRidiculous some of these punishments were heady stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors are if you just want to just pick your room that night than just takes it late in value appeal the case you get written up for that they get\nPunished particularly professors where there's a lot of gray area where a corrections officer gets to say if it's in a fence or not and in Illinois women were five times more likely than men decided for this offense called minor insults to him and we met in Illinois so years ago they were cited for something that was called reckless eyeball\nAnd what are the consequences of different punishments or more harsh punishments for women and ...\nThey're serious consequences you can lose good conduct credits that time is taken off your stay in prison in Illinois we found in one year alone twenty Fifteen some women last months even years of those credits\nBy way of Illinois now fix that problem but we found disproportionate loss of good conduct credits in California Louisiana and other states\nIn other states women get punished for small things and go to solitary confinement but one of the most common consequences is that women who lose visitation and phone privileges and that's cutting off mothers' from their children and why is this happening\nAll what's because presidents were built to control men often violent men and and then we applied these rules that were created for men we apply them to women\nDo the prisons recognize that this is a problem\nSome do tonight we're going to do a story about something called gender response of corrections\nIt's the idea of looking at why women are different the fact that they are less likely to come for violent crime some was hurt in prison they're less likely to be violent and then also they come with this high level of past traumas some Seventy five the Ninety percent of the history of physical and sexual abuse\nAnd that affects how they respond in prison if uh crushes officers yelling at them that might trigger some past trauma\nSo at this prison number go visit tonight in Iowa they've changed the way they do things like strip searches a woman can now take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on and the ideas to make something that can be traumatic a strip search a little less traumatic\nJoe how difficult is it to do this kind of reporting or inside the prison system in this country\nIt's very hard to get inside a person\nPrisons are some of the most closed off places in this country and we got invited into some prisons only when they were willing\nTo show us what they're doing only when they thought they were making some change but we were not allowed generally to talk to prisoners so we had to do other things we had to\nLetters to prisoners we had to find women who'd been in prison and had been released we did freedom of Information Act request and we were able to get this glimpse of how this on equal system of punishment comes I'm most harshly on women and we'll get a glimpse\nOf it later today on all things considered the next part of your investigation NPR's Joseph Shapiro thank you so much thank you Germany you're listening to here and [noise]\nBoy you could not get a better argument for why it is important to support Colorado Public radio supporting CPR supports NPR supports reporting like that

you've heard about how difficult it is to get into prisons to uncover these kinds of stories yet\nReporters are going to try and we have a justice reporter here who can probably emphasize emphasize that sentiment\nBut the thing is your dollar is when you get to Colorado Public radio you put it in a position where we can keep pushing\nAnd digging for those stories that are important even if it's

happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out my Mike Pompeo is there a if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis that this was a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered\nA that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something so that uh the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia end with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the uh economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia under the bus for this\nAlleged murder and then releasing this pastor is trying to go up a few notches in terms of its relationship with America\nA Saudi Arabia has a very very strong very long a business financial diplomatic arms and energy relationship with the United states and I this is the first time in the history of those two countries are at least since Nineteen Seventy three sons they are a bullet oil embargo that it's been\nThis fraught what about all the companies that have gotten upset and decided that they're not going to go to this big Saturday investment conference J. P. Morgan black rock MasterCard ... just to name a few\nUm we have to remember that Saudi Arabia is also been involved in a number of other human rights abuses including the war in Yemen Yemen's writes press freedom a high ... are these companies are likely to just go back to business as usual once this gets cleared up or is it just made them think hard about their relationship with Saudi Arabia\nWell Germany you bring up a good point ... is not unique he happens to be a critic he's not actually the loudest critics of Saudi Arabia um and and Saudi Arabia does this sort of thing a lot they silence journalists and they they crush dissent so these American companies\nHave had nothing to say about that until now something about this and maybe it's because he's a Washington Post columnist maybe it's because he's an American resident something about this has changed the dialogue with all of these companies backing out now as of now treasury secretary ... is still headed to the conference as is Christine Lagarde the head of the IMF so\nI'm all may not be lost but I think the Saudis are realizing that uh you know they're the biggest spenders NPR lobbying in Washington I think they're starting to realize if something doesn't happen they stand to lose a lot of these important relationships\nWhat brings me to one more thing just in thirty seconds we have left here alley um how important is Saudi Arabia economically for the United states\n[noise] huge like it's the it's America's number one weapons by or the president is talking to Leslie stall on a sixty minutes said\nYou know you quoted Boeing and Lockheed Martin and write the honest sellers to Saudi Arabia linking our economic relationship to jobs it's also the second largest uh him but you know we get the second largest amount of oil from Saudi Arabia Canada is first so\nThe relationship with Saudi Arabia is actually quite big in terms of military in oil\nThat's how she MSNBC anchor in economics correspondent thank you pleasure\nWell also on that sixty minutes focusing on CBS this past weekend Lesley Stahl as President Trump about that report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change that warned that rising temperatures could cause irreparable damage to the earth idea twenty forty\nDo you still think that climate change is a hoax look I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade\nWell at least at Twenty one young people across the country who disagree with the president and have joined a lawsuit against this administration saying it hasn't done enough to fight climate change and everyone's surprise that lawsuit is going to trial later this month\nOne of the plant is is eleven year old Levi dre hind he joins us from satellite Beach Florida Levi a first where did you make of the president's comments\nWell I I really don't know what to think of that\nBecause there's so many evidence that ... is an actual role\nAffecting actual people like me\nThe all the other plaintiffs in this lawsuit but how is it affecting you um well climate change is affecting me because it's you love arrives I'm On a barrier island and that barrier island is like right level at the sea and so when\nThe water level rises then it will flood the island like after Hurricane Irma flooded are street and things like that\nYeah well yeah you were paddling to the beach instead of blocking yes yeah a little if you're part of the suit there was actually put together by a group called our children's trust um what is the main complaint of the suit I mean what is the suit alleging\nWell what this lawsuit is saying if it saying that the U.S government is violating our constitutional right to have a clean sustainable low ... planet if not that they're not doing anything is that they know that climate change the problem\nBut the things that they are doing ice helping caused climate change like not cutting down on fossil fuels and things like that\nWe will you know I was surprised that there are as many suits as there are they've tripled since twenty fourteen there's the most are in the U.S there's about six hundred and fifty for us lawsuits and there have been other successes in Pakistan a lawyer sued his government\nFor not doing enough about climate change and one and Pakistan as a result has had to have action points in ministries and create a government commission where do you want to see happen because of your lawsuit\nOn if we win this lawsuit what we want is you want there to be um to for the government to put climate recovery plan into place and even if that doesn't happen or and they keep on fighting all the way through and tried to file again\nNow judges on the Supreme Court has said that the claim that's made in your lawsuit\nThat the government is violating your right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness by not doing more to halt climate change is broad and leaves a lot of room for differences of opinion we heard from the president a lesson in fact let's listen to the president again from his sixty minutes interview talking again about climate change\nThey say that we had hurricane that were far worse than\nWhat we just said was Michael ... says that they say when they say that India but what about scientists who say it's worse than ever\nA you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda\nThere is a difference of opinion right there he thinks it's political if this goes all the way to the Supreme Court are you worried that particular Trump appointed judges will allow room for opinion and not go on science [noise]\nUm I'm honestly not worried because we have lots of scientific facts\nAnd we have scientists that said things that prove our case I so I'm not really worried because it's pretty hard to fight science\n[noise] listen to one of your other a fellow plant is this is a Thirteen year old Avery McCray and why she decided to join the suit\nI Know that I have a constitutional right to a stable climate\nAnd I know that one of the government's jobs just to make sure that the future plan it will be hospitable for generations to come\nI Know that I Can't though but I Know that I had a voice [laughter]\nLook that's very admirable um but some people say well maybe these are kids being used I Want to ask you about that you were only eight years old when you became part of the lawsuit do you worry about people saying that you were being used\nOh no not at all because actually ... how the way I got involved with this lawsuit with Mr at my church and he talked to my mom about this lawsuit and she knew\nLots of research on our shoulders trucks and the lawsuit to make sure they had a legitimate case and when she asked me I said yes I really want to be part of this lawsuit because I'm worried about my environment\nAnd not being able to live on this barrier island where I'm older because I Want to live on this barrier island and be a marine biologist\nAnd so I don't really feel use that all I feel grateful to be part of the lawsuit Levi thank you so much\nYou're welcome and again we'll follow the story that lawsuit goes to trial next month [noise] it's here now [noise]\nI Need to add a from a classical perspective for sure but I

little red schoolhouse progressive private school in Manhattan decided to end an experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected he'll Casson is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nOr we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help their academic achievement\nWell you said that a part of this was based on that you know research this wasn't an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their class\nTerms looking around and seeing themselves and the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identities what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity\nAnd that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of the development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the\nWay many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of the few African American students in his or her class to feel fully a part of that group and and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced or having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers are white and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experience isn't that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's as much a you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those and even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYou know this is an unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior class to fight it so for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were getting for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice is what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school that look what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to expand it what's going on\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what a what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan\nUh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "16"}
