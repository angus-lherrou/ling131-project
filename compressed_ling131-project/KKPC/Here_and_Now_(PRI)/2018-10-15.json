to take unprecedented action to reduce to reduce the exchange impacts of climate change\nTheir report recommends reducing current emission is being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already out there what's known as negative and missions so let's take them with Gregory minute session of public affairs and environmental studies at the ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nProfessor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest way the economy dioxide out of the plants right because they just suck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take the ... out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing it all of these uh schemes to remove CEO to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one\nWith planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else is growing food um that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects on things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale has to be so large\nWell enough that we know that trees only started ... for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with a store and see what two in um in trees that I'm is not such an issue for storing it underground for example\nSo let's move on to some of the other ideas carbon capture storage what are some of the ideas there\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a\nPower plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now you find a way to collect it\nIn the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid CEO to going into the atmosphere with negative emissions there's a way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme\nBy again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy it takes you to that's in the atmosphere photosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops\nThan you burn the crops in the power plant and instead of putting that suit to back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and that has the potential to remove\nA billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground where it tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to do with it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for\nCrops that we're going to use the stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could\nA crate and food security issues which is something we want to avoid what\nAbout ... and by the way I just said Steven Pinker is a terrific and provocative new book a night and it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but what about just sucking it right

S. for twenty five years was Sears Tower in Chicago and\nI I Want to begin by reminding people that when we look at Sears or they sort of feisty old artifact of retail you know old mean successful this company was around for a hundred and thirty two years and it's incredible accomplishment\nBut basically the story of Sears demise\nIs simple keeping up with consumer tastes is really really hard\nSears disrupted retail over and over again at the turn of the twentieth century in the middle of the twentieth century and then finally Sears itself was disrupted because another company came along and his first Wal Mart and then Amazon that essentially had a mastery of consumer tastes in a mastery of technology\nThat was Sears superior and so it was essentially foisted by the very weapons that it wielded so successfully for its first many decades when you draw\nParallels between Sears and Amazon or Amazon started out selling a single product which was book series started out selling watches in the late Eighteen hundreds\nIt's an ... the parallels are remarkable I mean think about it this way if I said here's a story shortly after the turn of the century America had an enormous virtual retailer that began by selling only a single product which made an extraordinary shift to\nStart opening all of these physical stores around the country and it becomes this model of operational efficiency that many see as gobbling up retail entirely within the U.S\nThis is of course a story about Amazon that a lot of people are familiar with but it's also the story of Sears\nPeople don't recognize the fact that even though when we think of Sears we think oh well it's it's just to see her store seems didn't have any stories\nIn the U.S in Nineteen twenty five by Nineteen twenty nine there were three hundred is if you think Amazon is cropping up all over the country just imagine the explosion of seniors in the Nineteen twenties and Sears again of course started as a virtual retailer you looked at the consumer Bible\nYou picked out a watcher address or even a house that you wanted to buy and then you would have it mailed to your home it's the exact same thing\nWell and actually you know we've been watching Sears sort of slow motion disaster for some time now\nAre we remember that the Sears Tower in Chicago used to be called the Sears Tower in Chicago now it's called the Willis Tower less ah but you wrote about this about a year ago and you use the phrase or the Internet before the Internet when you were talking about how Sears relied on male or to get customers\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong it exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other domains is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they do keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecast but very very often forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests and one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm\nTrying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me the straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake what are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed productions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bomb bipolar elected was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um\nWell it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one\nThere is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this if I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts little forecasts are old news\nBut if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right then they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they're tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was gonna win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I\nSaid at look at my tweet from you know she might have to go I said it was going to happen\n[laughter] yup and you know look it's a there's an old saying bug me a mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you to bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that had big and you say look at this what a brilliant investor I Am well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future battle and co author of super forecasting the art and science of production dance thank you so much for joining us thank you and let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise at here now dot org\nNow to the environmental fallout from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the Carr Fire swept through parts of the city of reading and the surrounding area today residents are faced with burning hillsides burned hillsides and more than a thousand homes sites contaminated with toxic\nGosh Liam Moriarty from Jefferson public radio reports\n[noise] I'm just off keswick dam road on the western edge of renting the Carr Fire blasted through this neighborhood on the evening um July twenty six incentive reading dozens of homes on this date accrue in white hazmat suits and respirators isn't a thought ugly sifting through the ash and rubble\nIvan Rodriguez the California Department of toxic substances control says this is phase one of the clean up\nThat entails screening the properties that had been devastated by the fire and looking at household hazardous waste that needs to be removed to allow for the ash and debris to go off in the future time Rodriguez\nSays the typical American home contains a whole range of products that can cause toxic contamination after a fire\nYou for the first guys who wanders would have been for batteries looking for any paints any solving any pesticides herbicides\nHazmat workers are marking what they find with spray paint to signal the removal crews white paint for propane tanks and other standard hazardous waste ... which requires its own special removal techniques\nOnce phase one is complete crews will collect the ash and rumble including the building's foundation and hold it all off to a hazardous waste facility\nThe danger of toxic gas blowing across the landscape gives this job a sense of urgency but there are other post fire threat says well\nWe're on the back deck of my house\nDaniel Whitley a standing behind his home in the lake reading states neighborhood were many homes were damaged or destroyed Whitley was nearly one of them were looking at the remnants of the Carr Fire that came perilously close to the back of the house as he points to the burn hillside right out is back door he talks about his plans\nTo head off the erosion that winter rains are likely to cause I'll put in some straw bottles those long stalled failed flexible things and then I'm going to plant some pretty bunch grasses up their Whitley says if he can get the grasses established before winter he thinks he can avoid potential mudslides\nDrew co says that in some of ratings burned over hillside neighborhoods so called debris flows could well be a danger\nShe can have essentially a large mass of rock and mud and water moving down and you can wipe out a house\nCall was with Cal fire's watershed emergency response team the group of hydrologist a soil scientist and other experts uses sophisticated digital mapping tools and onsite observation to identify populated areas at risk for landslides another post fire hazards to safety and property\nHe says the size of the Carr Fire and the geological conditions in reading means of threats here aren't as dire as after last year's massive Thomas Fire in Southern California\nWe don't have large concentrations of population just downstream of watersheds that can really respond in a high magnitude waited storms falling wildfire we don't have a modest you don't hear\nMontecito on the coast just north of Los Angeles was hit with monster mudslides last January when heavy rains fail on burned over hillsides\nTwo dozen people died but risks to people and their homes aren't the only erosion concern [noise]\nWe are looking at a very clear creek and across from the ashes actually wind and fire restoration projects\nTricia brats you as a biologist with the California Department of fish and wildlife she says her agency and others have spent a lot of time effort and money restoring discreet salmon and other threatened fish can recover\nNow she and her colleagues are worried the post fire hillsides denuded the vegetation could undo some of those games by allowing ash and find sediment to Washington the creek and clog up the mess we're salmon lay their eggs\nYou need water moving through that national bringing Deval Patrick and and if it's full of sand and find some others the eggs and they die\nClinton Snyder with the regional water quality control board and said ash from broken homes often contains heavy metals and other toxins and he says\nAs those metals move into the stream system then and then we have the potential to further in fact some on it and other organisms from toxicity standpoint\nSnyder says efforts to prevent the erosion into those streams is crucial to minimizing the harm the sediments and toxins could do to fish\nRight now the clock is ticking and efforts to get hillside stabilized and contaminated sites cleaned up are in full swing\nHow soon winter rains arrive and how heavily they fall will go a long way toward determining how much damage the Carr Fire continues to cause long after the flames are doused for hearing now I'm Liam Moriarty reporting from Redding, California\nBut it can live in Lakewood, Colorado I recently moved here from Minnesota and in the public radio it hurts unity to learn more about this beautiful state I Lived in\nWell thanks Zan thanks year gift and win Dan's giving he's giving 'cause he wants to support the future of caught a public radio in the future listeners", "year": "2018",
