same time and a congressman premieres been elected re elected twice\nYeah so you've got these two popular politicians and just talking about this moment when Heidi Heitkamp and now she vote no on Kavanaugh even though she knew it would hurt her politically in the state of North Dakota let's listen\nI'm Heidi Heitkamp and I thought you should hear exactly why I voted against judge Kavanaugh ... first shot and honestly\nI don't think he told the truth and even if he did he showed them how to be true biased to be impartial I voted for Neil Gorsuch so I Know there are many other conservative judges who can do this job without carrying our country apart\nSo again very plain spoken there I don't think he told the truth is how do people react to that\nOh for a while there and it became a kind of an issue in North Dakota because a justice Kevin I had a had a pretty good approval ratings of from North Dakota voters but when it came down to it I think that whole thing about the Kavanaugh race\nIs kind of died down now and uh we're looking at more pocketbook issues in North Dakota so in terms of affecting her turn out\nThere are a lot of a political advisers I've been talking to a lot of observers who said that she was in a no win situation no matter what if she was voted for Kavanaugh she could've hurt her standing with her base in North Dakota and if she voted against it there were a lot of people say the Republicans wouldn't have gone with her anyway at\nNight and and this time and a half million that came in from across the country supporting her because she did that ... ... people don't see that making a big difference\nI they don't know if it's going to make a big difference I Know a congressman Kramer would like to point that out needed in a debate that was held last friday he pointed out the twelve and a half million dollars came in and he read it as being from pro abortion groups and sent it I can snap back and said shame on you\nYeah well he's also portrayed her decision to vote no as cave in to the coastal elite bass he's a well known candidate as you said North Dakota only congressman lets us into a new Congress and Kramer's ads and this one he's walking among bulldozers and other heavy machinery you hear it rumbling in the background\nThat meant cutting taxes and rolling back regulations that were widely in our business\nOur national economy is booming\nSo he mentions economic rocket ship we know the economy is booming right now but there I'd be a bumpy lending a when the tax cuts wear off with they're already starting to end the terrorists to bite so how was he addressing that with farmers are manufactured in North Dakota\nIn terms of farmers and manufacturers he's he's got the same kind of message\nThat did this might be a bumping rolled but your look you have to look at it long term that if they act actually can settle some of these disputes and get better deals for North Dakota farmers north to the manufacturers it's going to be good in the long run ... some farmers agree with that some farmers do not as they see soybeans piling up uh with no market\nAnd that that really is a conundrum for a lot of people\nThat's

served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and say then thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with them about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian ... rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related\nTo a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who've already knew\nThere were a very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether you're a gray area in areas where it was sort of being prices means something or whether you're on the west coast\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices ... everyone talks about the only thing about this country which is very diverse out of the times where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge out that this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand four increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nFlying uh well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks in the book and suddenly I might add discussing whether the law the long term outlook is all about\nOh we say about the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that you heard\nFrom

do you have any I mean I Know you don't want to speculate that uh\nWell I Would say that this the the ... there were lots of people there were lots of people that wanted Bolger did what is at least irony here and striking irony is one of the inmates at that prison just been convicted along with a\nFrank celebrity the mob a legendary mob boss for the murder curry and bought in Massachusetts\nDecades ago he had just been convicted and that person poll we did was assigned\nTo the say facility which makes one question why in the world the bureau of prisons would put somebody like Bolger in a prison where there would be proximity to that to that other inmates\nOkay we're going to have to wait and find out more sensational so what are you hearing anything from the families of the people he was involved in killing\nAh no I I have I have not been working on this story I'd been working on the story of what happened there and how is it trying to get those details it's still

all about his time in ...\nWell ... says I'm really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community the diverse than the diversity in the community if we're all hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches\nUm that all made him feel at home um that bakeries that delicatessens and he often commented that he could here yet ... fever and it doesn't have a language is spoken as he walked down the street a fact community\nHe actually learned ... paid get yes well do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\nI'm In the neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrels hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighbor that the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably also taken the lead probe community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence or we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers\nThere's going to be so much work to be done I mean we have confused everybody in the world including ourselves and we're confused our friends and our enemies they have no idea what the United States stands for what we are likely to do what we think is important and\nUh so the work would be work that I feel very well prepared for having none of the Senate for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department\nAnd it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting or are you going to be doing any of that let's say if you feel like oh I have no idea care but I'm I'm going to you know I'm not going to even think about can we get through this November sex selection about what's going to happen after that but I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure\nWe have a Democrat in the White House come January [laughter]\nOkay so care um she was talking about how America is policies and have confused a lot of people around the world but she did confuse people there by paying a little bit yeah she's not going to be running I'd like to be president what did you take it from that\nI think she she she could have been more explicit let's be clear she could have said I Am absolutely not running for president but I'd like to help whatever candidate is to do this or I Would be part of it and I'd be happy to be part of it administration that with a democratic minister ration and twenty Twenty one\nI'm so I think she could have been more explicit and so in a lot of ways she was sort of having a cake and eat it too but I she has no intention of running from what from the people I talk to you and the people close to her and she herself I think it has sort of left that off the table\nWell and we could hear a lot of disappointment in the audience that come to hear her speak but also other Democrats voicing concern that she was injecting herself\nInto politics just a week before the midterms when the Republicans and specifically President Trump use her as someone to gin up their base and get people to vote\nA for Republicans I'm you did try to shift to attention to other potential democratic candidates and twenty twenty I'm Elizabeth Warren Michael Bloomberg what she said\nShe was she she was being very diplomatic about all I Know she has more thoughts on them both positive and negative but she tried to stress the positive aspects of each of them\nUm and what kind of candidates they pay and sort of was assessing them on that she didn't do the negative assessments um but I think what what she was trying to say if there's plenty of people in the in the slate of candidates and all of them would be different essentially\nUm what was really interesting about it to me is that what happens whenever she says anything she obviously as Trump's favorite a person to attack you know among his base\nAt the same time other people who have lost elections and she didn't quite lose if one she lost she didn't lose the popular vote at least which must be just grading upon her you know always I Would think for the rest of her life she had three million more votes than President Trump yes yes\nSo other candidates who lost to John McCain who's of course passed John Kerry Mitt Romney they all got to speak to speak up now that gets to be kept quite loudly and whenever she does Democrats and others decry her for doing so I I find that really unusual and and\nI think she should be able to talk up I think she should be able to say things she wants and that everything she says shouldn't be parsed quite so much\nWell so we're still left with her saying you asked if she would do the heavy lifting\n... I think well you know will will you run for president I think she heard it as well I help other candidates um she said she wasn't running but she'd like to be president and you interpreted that as a writer who wouldn't have wanted to put that much working and be a politician who wouldn't\nHave wanted to be president [noise] um but it still this sort of a cloud over what she meant but you didn't ask her specifically about Russian interference in the midterms what did she say\nWell she she had done that because uh uh right after the election I didn't interview with her where she was sort of a painting the picture of exactly what the ... investigation found and at the time people had made fun of her for doing that and calling her paranoid and so I wanted to point out that she was entirely right about what she had said about the impact of the Russians\nAre unfortunately I think we'll never know what the true impact is except that they were there and it had some impact and so she ... she was discussing essentially we were discussing essentially that she was right about what had happened\nAnd what we need to do going forward and she definitely a criticized the social media companies for their role in that problem and wondered whether they were prepared for elections going forward\n...
