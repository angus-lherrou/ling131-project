power and it seems like not really any great chance of power being restored in the near term I mean I think we're looking at weeks if not months given sort of the scale of damage that I'm hearing about\nMental powers are stored there's also no water throughout the city there is no cell phone service in general communication is still just like a huge challenge\nHundreds of thousands are also without power in parts of North Carolina\nMeanwhile in Virginia due to flash flooding and several suspected tornadoes from hurricane Michael that's being blamed for five gas David side down from

less okay others look like they're okay except for they have a tree you know leaning on this on the roof\nAnd then there are other buildings where the wind just shared the whole face of the building off I mean I saw several churches there were just you know really missing their facades or their side walls and you could pure right into the sanctuary and see the pews from from standing out on the sidewalk I mean you know so so it it it was really sort of\nHouse by house in a way but you know some neighborhoods really you could tell\nBore the brunt of the damage and and you know we've heard about Lynn haven which is a town just north of Panama City and also some of the parts of Panama City that I got into today um look pretty bad\nNow we're seeing the death toll rise today across the region um but there's so much rubble out there is there a sense that there could still be a lot of people who are who are missing still trapped underneath a rebel I'm at a need to be taken out I\nI don't know that I saw that kind of depth damage in Panama City I think\nYou know I think the concern here is more\nSort of long term you know can people live there I mean there's no power and it seems

[noise] you know I don't know that we're necessarily going to see a spike in the death toll from Panama City although we could I think it's more like the question is like when can people our people are going to go forward\nAnd and live there while they rebuilt\nWasn't there must be some people there now as you say there's no power there's no water for the people who who are who stayed behind how are they are they getting on where they say\nWell hour by hour is how one woman described it to me I mean they're you know they've got bottled water there there are some of them who are making

it's here and now the stock market opened higher this morning after to nail biting days on Wall street the Dow Jones ... five point three percent over Wednesday and Thursday its worst performance since February\nSo what's going on were those drops the beginning of the answer the bull market or merely a correction Michael Reagan is senior editor at Bloomberg News Hi Mike Hi Robyn so the market just start off higher today it's now back down a little\nAnalysts have been telling us said the drops over the last couple of days were selection of concern about Trump's trade wars but President Trump\nIs saying it's the fed which has raised interest rates a little bit of the economy has heated up others have agreed with that what what do you say\nWell it's interesting Robin I've been trying to explain the stock market for a good twelve years now and I'll tell you there are some days what I can tell you with a hundred percent confidence what's going on and there are other days where the cops is a little bit lower\nThis week I Would say it's sort of that lower confidence and certainly there are things you can point to for the initial a weakness that we saw in the markets starting about three weeks ago the rapid increase in interest rate\nUh there were a few companies that came out and pointed at the tariffs on China as a affecting their earnings\nAnd there was also the story from a Business Week about China are installing the secret chips on some companies' servers\nAll of that really ah got the ball rolling but once it started snowballing um it's very hard to explain specifically what caused it there's theories that\nThere are hedge funds are computerized hedge funds that ... act to stuff like changes in the momentum of the stock market or the volatility and they tend to uh so aggressively when do those things shift into a new regime\nSo the prevailing theory is that it started with concerns about interest rates and trade and then the selling got a little out of control by some of these a computerized a systematic strategies of of some of the ...\nYeah so so what overall would you say about the economy because you know it seems to be going great guns um and you know in ... and employment is low so where are we\nAre yeah I I mean that at the current state of the economy that's all true um there is quite a bit of a uncertainty about ... how high interest rates are headed and what the ultimate impacts of the trade tensions between us and China will be\nSo whenever there's uncertainty even though right now things are going great that uncertainty really can adds to the volatility in the stock market specifically ah like we've seen over the past week\nWell this this has kept interest rates far below you know historic definitions of normal I mean they were super low after the crisis to try to get the economy rebounding and isn't the thinking that as a a an economy heat up\nAnd the engine really starts to heat up the fed acts as a cooling you know by by raising interest rates just a little bit but then we hear President Trump\nCalling the fed loco and to have to engineer so what's your view what's too\nWell right I mean the fed is doing what you said the risk is that the economy over sheets and that inflation gets too high and that can ... basically cause a hard landing in the economy can cause sort of a reversal of these trends we've seen I\nThink for President Trump she views the stock market as sort of who's alternative approval rating right and he's very interested in keeping keeping it high so he's not happy with the fed\nAnd others have learned to not last yourself to the stock market thing Michael Reagan as senior editor of Bloomberg News thanks so much thought you were up and you're listening to hearing now [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nListening to here and now on CPR news what is happening right now with the economy [noise]\nHey I'm Grace hood I cover energy environment but I'm sitting right next to Ben
