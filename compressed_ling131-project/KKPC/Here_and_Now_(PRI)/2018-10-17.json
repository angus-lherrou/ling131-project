October twenty third through October twenty eight tickets at Denver centered dot org it's Colorado\nMatters from CPR News I'm Ryan Warner could restored of justice the idea of victim and offend or trying to come to a mutual understanding could it be a solution and helping those who have suffered sexual assault he'll it's the question we're asking on the show today\nAnd literally a you're a restored of justice trainer in facilitator you mentioned earlier a meeting that you've facilitated between Charlotte ... Evans who's three year old son case on was killed in a drive by shooting in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd the killer Raymond Johnson or we spoke with Charlotte ... Evans in twenty eleven and again the following year after she became the first person in Colorado\nTo use the state law for a victim offender dialogue\nThey gave him the opportunity to speak first\nAnd he began to disclose his whole life what led him up to the actual crime that he committed and taken my son's life\nAnd when he began to speak the first thing that came out of his mouth was thank you for being here thank you for this opportunity and I messed up and he began to\nWheat and he was very remorseful\nAbout the whole thing to where he was pretty much out of control as far as his remorse\nSo later in September of twenty sixteen Charlotte Evans spoke with another man convicted in the crime Paul Little John\nI just want to note there were many years between ah the murder of her son and the restored of justice process is is that important that there'll be time between the crime and the dialogue\n[noise] um it yeah that was really interesting four years later when she met with Paul that was a totally different conference she was working for something totally different the second time\nI think when I get cases are referred to me that are\nTwelve Thirteen Seventeen years old I feel a little bit\nBetter about those than the ones that are like the pre pleased case that I just talked about the victims and when somebody has lost a loved one if they are still in the court process and they are still hit with um\nBills insurance daily it just brings a different piece and somebody who's had some time to work through some of what's happened\nAnd so you think that the process works better if some time has passed and some of the [noise] gosh I it's really the the the paperwork of death or the paperwork of being a victim has settled to some extent\nI everybody's different so I don't want to say that I think it works better but there are probably fewer things or different things to work through a period of time has passed what does it\nTake to get a an offender in a victim on the same page and even prepared for that dialogue\nSo I'm not sure if we ever get them on the same page um we are all human beings we sort of all have different um take on the things that have happened to us in our lives\nBut to bring them together takes anywhere I Would say from four months to a year\nOf where he came back and forth with each of them to figure out exactly what a victim of a serious crime is looking for and to determine whether or not the person who can ... who committed the offense can give them that\nNancy Louis from the Colorado organization for a victim assistance [noise] what would it take to bring this process restored of justice to Colorado When it comes to sexual assaults ... what do you think is the problem is you're\nWell I think we're moving towards that I mean with this study we had probably forty forty train facilitators the it will be taking a look at\n'em once ... you know once we get sort of through this study and taking a look at it at the University of the University of Denver is taking a look at what is it going to take to have facilitators who understand\nThe manipulation that can happen with a sexual assault perpetrator and how do you study for that so it's very difficult you know well you you have people who have worked with a offenders and understand what that manipulation looks like\nWhat what do you think about the timeline a of when you engage in restored of justice I mean is it something that you think can come fresh off a crime or do you agree that it ought to be something that follows perhaps years later\nI think every single person who is a crime victim is different and I don't think there's any way you can put a time limit on it the victim has to come to the space that they ... that's what they request and that's what they want\nAnd what you have to realize is with a very serious crime like sexual assault or losing a loved one there's so much trauma involved right away and until you get through that trauma until you've passed a little bit beyond it can you make those decisions will thanks\nTo both of you for being with us we appreciate it thank you so much for having us that

say it leaves out because of the fat from member station WBUR AMU explains\nThe new museum stands directly across the street from a memorial to more than Twenty one thousand officers from across the country who had died in the line of duty\nLikes them memorial the national law enforcement museum has a mission to honor officers and teach the public about what it takes to be one\nWanted to police do how do they do it why do they do it\nThis is Craig Floyd the c._e._o. of the national law enforcement memorial fund it's the force behind the museum which is privately funded mostly by corporations like Motorola target and clock fleets not a police officer but he does talk like one\nOf our objective is number one of our visitors walk in the shoes experience or what it's like to be a law enforcement professional\nAnd in many ways the museum does just that when you walk in you see a park police helicopter hanging from the rafters and shot out pick up truck that was involved in a shootout there are exhibits about the different jobs people can have in law enforcement\nFrom bomb squads to canine unit [noise]\nYes there's a real police dog on hand to there's also a section on the history of policing in America here's lead exhibit developer Rebecca loony\nIs areas such a lousy last prohibition era drug enforcement up through further than and everything that's happening in line for the\nFive years racial minorities and women are represented in videos and photographs by the museum it doesn't directly address their experiences as citizens or members of the force is important\nRon Hampton is a retired D.C police officer and the former head of the national black Police Association he's excited to visit the museum soon but he wishes it had done more to reflect diversity in the ranks\nPeople of color African American people Hispanic people women was not Apollo pollution in the very beginning I mean they were left out it was a white male dominated institution\nHe says he urged the museums organizing committee to include that side of the story\nAnd one of the things that we talked about was how policing evolved in this country as a related to ... ... ... you're going to tell the story you knew the Joe the host of\nBlack lives matter D.C organizer April ... says the whole concept of the museum to police offends her\nLifted up out propaganda

been a disconnect in some communities around this country over the last few years I think this Newseum experienced the educational programs associated with it are going to go a long way toward a building those bridges\nFor his part D.C police chief Peter ... says he thinks the museum will be a valuable\nAddition to the city folks who don't know a lot about the strides that law force has been making in recent years to try and develop frustration shifted as as I said all all the Austrian Floyd says he's confident the model over\nThis will be a machine destination in Washington DC I assure

as NPR's Mara Liasson tells us Trump also continues to give the benefit of the doubt to the Saudi royal family\nThe president said he'll be brief soon by secretary of state Mike Pompeo who's on his way back from meetings in Saudi Arabia and turkey President Trump has compared the Saudi royal family to Brett Kavanaugh suggesting that they've both been considered guilty until proven innocent today he was asked whether those statements gave the Saudis cover\nAnd that given caboodle would that being said Saudi Arabia has been a very important ally of ours in the middle east\nThe president also said he thinks audiotapes of what could be ... torture and dismembered meant at the hands of Saudi Government officials probably exists and that he's asked the Turkish government to share those tapes with us investigators Mara Liasson NPR News the White House\nCiting waste and fat in the federal budget President Trump says he's directing members of his cabinet to adopt what he calls the nickel

forty others wounded local authorities encourage say that the gunman was an Eighteen year old student there reporting that he took his own life they say this was not a terrorist attack or categorize this as again a mass\nRobin unfortunately it feels as though there was a little bit more than a whiff of connection between the president and the the first family and\nUh the Saudi officials which is a big concern I I Do think is critical for us to get all of the information before we up making a big declarations I Wish there was a little bit more of a Lindsey Graham and Donald Trump when he's talking about the situation in the\nFire and fury that we we do here ... and Lindsey Graham's voice\nBut the president is right and that Saudi Arabia is an important business interests for the United states for a hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of business interests one hundred ten billion a with regard to military purchases but if things go as it all indications are that this was a brutal brutal killing\nThen I clearly we need to take drastic steps in and really make a point this is a human rights issue and this is about ... what what is right\nUp for our country and setting an example that this kind of behavior is simply not tolerate\nJamal if this is on the minds of voters in a few weeks is that good for Trump or bad for Trump\nIt would be bad for Trump but I doubt that it will be on the minds of voters voters are usually concerned with things that are happening much closer to home not just their pocketbooks but also\nUm you know can their kids Googled the president of United States and the first lady and not have to have the parents filter on their computers removed results come back I think that there is a real values problem with the president not just how you interact\nAbroad but also the values but he exposes as the president and his desire to win at all costs\nThe regardless of how you perform the things he said about Stormy Daniels with things you said about um calling her heart as I Love it for\nTheir their their it's just a really tough times with my or the president of United States and I think that will matter along with the others will\nTell us you know many people do and so as you know let's head into the ... midterms with another issue first of all just to as he put the shout at ... behind us um this notion that those tapes might come out so that's hovering over everything that the Turks say they have these audio tapes on the actual murder and they sound grizzly\nBut then there's the ... ah the treasure partner reported this week that the U.S budget deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars under President Trump his critics as you know Alice are\nBlaming the tax cut but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed rising federal deficits on social programs\nWhich are already serving at a church ruined addict oriented and ... programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend every year\nAlice I'm just that was from Bloomberg TV by the way how popular is that going to be when people figure out what entitlement programs are and\n... clearly if they are affected and if we do have to make cuts with regard to those programs uh it it will have an impact I Believe on voters and Democrats can certainly use that as as a a message to to fight against Republicans but\nI'd like to think that between the the unemployment rate at historic lows and we have job numbers are at a at an all time high\nAnd we're having more confidence in the economy those kind of barometer is with regards to\nA job in the economy will have more of an impact at least when we're talking about the mid term it's more short term long term yes and we're getting close to twenty twenty that might might be an issue but\nPeople right now we're looking at do I have a job and I'm making more money than I made a last year or two years ago and and how ... how am I comfortable with regard to putting money away for a rainy day and right now it looks as though more people are feeling more confident in their individual paychecks which will be beneficial\nTo a gym all ... where's the Democrat making the case that the reason that the deficit is is so big is a largely because of this huge tax cut that was that was supposed to pay for itself here I Am or whatever [laughter]\nAre we going to go [laughter] of\nThis is exactly you're right we just pass a tax cut that put billions of dollars back into the hands of the wealthiest people we're borrowing money\nFrom the Chinese which is in the Saudis and all the other people around the world who are buying American Doug\nAnd Doug you can't tell me that doesn't matter as we begin to negotiate some of these issues around the world and I got to tell you the Republicans always run a jobs program it's called the defense department because that money doesn't just go to taking care of troops it also goes to all the defense contractors were being paid in lots of Republican\nDistricts I think this is a we we got to look at the the broader budget and I will tell you if the Donald Trump wants to start cutting entitlements you should call George W. Bush I ask how that went for him when he started talking about reforming Medicare so you can\nLook again with an eye on the upcoming elections in their second and possibly final debate of the Texas Democrat they don't recreate it really came out on the attack against the Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nWho is seeing a bump in some polls but ... calls cruise dishonest for saying he supported a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil here's Cruz's response\nWell it gets clear congressman O'Rourke folders of told him to come out on the attack so if he wants to insults me and call me a liar that's fine but you know John Adams famously said facts are stubborn things\nAnd now ... did one vote for an oil tax but it never ... on a cruise with it yet crews did I'm looking for an oil tax it never became a but I was able to use Donald Trump's own words against cruise last night um just your thoughts Alison what would you ... you know what would you advise as a strategist\nWell first of all look clearly O'Rourke is is resorting to name calling instead of looking at the record when he spent three times as much as Ted Cruz and he's still behind but ten points it in the polls and I I was\nTed Cruz is communications director in the twenty sixteen campaign and I can still hear line had in my head but then you heard it last night [laughter] exactly and here's the thing if you if you look at the issues that are important to people of Texas Beto O'Rourke doesn't represent those issues he's from government funded late term abortions socialized medicine open borders\nAnd he's advocating for wind and solar energy in Texas of all places so what what people saw last night was a ... a candidate that\nAre clearly he might get a lot of media attention and has a lot of money but his values are not reflected\nOf Texas at the end of the day that Republicans and the people to Texas will come home to to someone that has represented them well with their values and ... and that's what we'll see in a lot of these Republican Senate races across the country ... would you recommend a beta wrote continue that you know swinging coming out swinging what would you say\nCertainly has come out swinging look I'm not a tax and but I did do a lot of ah lived in South Carolina south in the south in some would argue with not types of South Dakota understand but there's a real where there's a real concern here because a lot of Americans are going through real problems like opioid abuse and people were\nMore care not less care I think that uh we're talking about different populations of people there are lots of Latino voters in Texas who I think probably care about making sure the babies are separated from their mothers at the border when they crossed by the government\nYou know there's some real issues so bad or work and Ted Cruz maybe talking to two different parts of Texas\nAnd by the way it was in fact over okay was alright supposed to have a ... voted high dollar a barrel [laughter] there's a whole the whole fact checking about it in the Texas Tribune people can go and check it out I'm\nJamal or just quick you think that it was a silly that Elizabeth Warren came out with her DNA test with a just a few weeks before the election it\nCertainly seems in retrospect as well too cute by half um you know you can't play this game with Donald Trump don't fall into a layer because he will never let\nYou escaping she's more presidential contender in twenty twenty the Native Americans instead of just your mouse him into Democrat hosted he'll TV thank you both for\nIts here now and

school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now Hi Jeremy [noise] so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee\nOr it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees connect unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le descended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its\nInvestigation to submit any of the information that its obtain drew the full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of a committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with his this is a tax committee and so it certainly could be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns and you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out\nBeyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about you know some of the tax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest\nThe New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to ... and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it's searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four\nLaw that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nAre the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon\nWho um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or place in a blind trust\nHis business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the Coolidge in ... a time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them well that's a tough\nQuestion because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut it gives President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it it it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about it\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the these decisions and is there some personal or business\nInterest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that all that would be something that might come out from an examination returns", "show_name": "Here and
