Jeremy hops and Amazon announced today that it is raising its minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all us workers\nThe move comes on the heels of criticism over how much the trillion dollar company pays its warehouse workers according to Amazon itself about twenty eight thousand dollars a year\nJoining us now is that she MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent and co hosts of el she in rural high alley I Jeremy so we ran the numbers on this and a full time employee and an Amazon warehouse making twenty eight thousand dollars a year is getting about Thirteen dollars Fifteen cents an hour so this would go up to Fifteen how big of a deal is\nYes so first of all it's a big deal in illustrating exactly what you came up with and you ran the numbers that Fifteen dollars an hour which sounds extreme to some people is not a lot of money it is it's somewhere close to the poverty level\nUm however there are some Amazon employees making the federal minimum wage is seven and a quarter an hour there part time employees there are a lot of contractors and that's part of the issue so\nThere are some are in fact a number of uh Amazon employees are earning more than Fifteen dollars an hour right now but uh using Fifteen as a base is not just numerically important it's possibly more symbolically important because that's the number that people like Bernie Sanders and a lot of progressive that a lot of union groups\nHave been saying is a number that we should use as a minimum it's important to note that while most states have a higher minimum the federal minimum wage right now seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour\nSo you can imagine how badly about that is to get by on\nAnyone when some cities have said we're raising our minimum wage up to Fifteen dollars an hour not not that long ago just in the last few years people said oh that's really going to harm the economy why his Amazon changed his mind well\nMostly the same reason everybody changes their mind on this thing going all the way back to Henry Ford there's this great legend about how Henry Ford or you know gave his workers five dollars a day so that they could afford to buy cars\nThere's a lot of criticism of whether that's actually true or not um you know you can't use that example for you know a a jet plane company like Boeing they can't pay their employees enough to buy jets\nUm but it get on one level there's public pressure on the other level it just expensive to not pay people the right amount of money because there's so much churn and people go work elsewhere and they don't feel any commitment to your company\nAnd it's hard to get workers that becomes a problem so with Amazon like with target like with Wal Mart they all realize that they're in a market in which their wages were either not competitive or not better than others and it was costing them more to have all these workers churn through\nI was reading a quote earlier today from Larry Kudlow the president's ... economic advisor who was asked about this and he said he doesn't think that this is going to lead to inflation so I thought it was interesting that they would even be thinking about Iran's doing something but there are so big now I guess maybe you do have to think\nYes so when it's Wal Mart what its target when it's Amazon you actually do think about inflation what we've got right now is a situation that in the last year inflation has been greater than wage growth so we finally got wage growth\nA and inflation is higher than that oil prices are going up and if you cause people to have higher wages they'll buy more which will cause product\nTo become more expensive so inflation's a real concern um ... I don't know that a lot of people think it should be used in as an excuse not to pay people more money but uh it is actually a real concern that if people's wages go up but\nNot everybody does and the price of a hamburger and a cup of coffee in a gallon of gas or all goes up then you create a different problem where people are a little poorer than they were in the first place\nEllie just briefly you think the federal government's going to raise the minimum wage at any point\nA that's a hard battle they they should have to seven and a quarter is completely out of sync with what people need to earn but uh that's not that's not something that's on this current administration's agenda\nNow does she MSNBC anchor in economics correspondent thank you my pleasure and we should note that Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR this is here now [noise]\nElection day is coming in Colorado Public radio has everything you need to have to end informed vote with CPR news stories taking you around the state CPR new ... giving you with us from looking candidates and issues than national political coverage there\nAre a lot of ways you can get contacts and clarity about this year's midterm ... find on\nColorado Public Radio's comprehensive election coverage and CPR not um [noise]\n\nI'm Sharon ... court documents on sale today show for members of the militant white supremacist an anti Semitic group from California have been arrested on charges that they traveled to Virginia last year to incite a riot\nAnd to attack counterprotesters and a white nationalist rally that turn deadly death David alleges that the four men were among the most violent individuals that the events in Charlottesville [noise]\nA report made public today by the department of homeland security is internal watchdog says immigration officials were not prepared to manage the consequences of its zero tolerance policy at the border this summer\nThe policy led to the separation of nearly three thousand children from parents the report says poor communication by immigration officials met some parents were not told how to reach the children from\nWhom they were separated and border patrol did not insure that children too young to talk could be properly identified you're listening to hear now [noise] um\nSupport comes from CU presents featuring Jessica Lange dance\nA contemporary dance company whose repertoire celebrates shape space and movement friday October fifth at Mackey auditorium CU presents dot org support\nComes from Colorado State university's College of business on line NBA committed to helping professionals reached the next level offering five star dates year round more at sea su biz dot com slash next\nWhat's on your mind to this election\nCPR reporters have been all over the state asking Coloradans we'll hear their answers in a new series called the road trip to November today taking the temperature of the governor's race issue or ...\nThat come out here and [noise] I don't like the only poll calf yesterday the Lakers back which I don't know what this all about we don't have those rules groups like what your story at seven hunt CPR Colorado matters\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Smith who a Ford says was there a it includes ... is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which he and his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which\nAh that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\n... and and it's about technology obviously we should say Oregon Vermont Washington do have their own net neutrality lost dozens of states are debating having there's the California is the big ... you know when it's something like emission standards or solar panels other states seem to follow what\nOne one state has this and they have you know Web sites that are used across the country what happens when one state decides had net neutrality just an impact others states in any way I mean just across borders\nI mean you're totally right on the Internet is is is not a a\nYou know has no geographic location here I mean part of this though is that you know California is leading a coalition about like on twenty\nState attorney general's ah we're filing suit or in this case so they were about you know California's leader here but not this is not a suicide mission by themselves um but you're right I mean California obviously is that the country's biggest state and it's also been\nThe home of liberalism right for a long time and the home of a of the modern day you know quote unquote resistance and so you could very well see a scenario here where California if successful in federal court you know this could really open the floodgates option that neutrality issues but on a cruise ship the broader conversation between the Trump Administration and fifty state houses across\nA you know by the way they did is a already suing California for allowing sanctuary cities and write and write local police don't cooperate with federal immigration officials in turn over the illegal\nImmigrants undocumented immigrants the city said to maintain their local community a reporter with people um and in July California when the first round of that battle in court so\nWe'll see what happens here but meantime as we said I'm a the these were rolled back a year ago are people feeling any impact from that are people saying how ... you know everything slowing down or speeding up\nYeah I haven't noticed anything out of I don't know if listeners have I mean ultimately though that this is not just some I think one of the worries from from people in my my point of view is that deal you know the sort of seem like to listeners that some sort of\nHigh minded debate about the way the Internet is structured but you know a few stream videos on you know Netflix or Hulu and you know this is really gonna affect\nYour data experience the Internet right which obviously we all depend on every single day so I think it's something that people pay attention to this is not just day intellectual debate between you know law professors of how the meaning of the constitution that says something that you're going to affect our lives in ...\nBut again on the on the level of technology you know when this was opposed um ... pi appointed is chair of the FCC and twenty Seventeen\nArgued about how this would prevent an investment broadband companies we can you just briefly and without breaking our heads explain why they are ... by the FCC and the minister Haitian do not did not want net neutrality\nYeah they just see this as you know onerous regulations on something it's not needed right I mean a pie said at the time\nYou know I'm looking at a quarter or you know to the Internet is free and open today and will continue to be so under light touch protections right I'm obviously the federal government a conservative ministry Asians always just as looking out for the fact that\nWith too many state with too many regulations\nOr you know it hurts the private sector right and I think especially there's a concern here among broadband providers that of California is successful you could have a scenario where you have a patchwork\nOf fifty different net neutrality loss um that obviously it'd be a regulatory minefield for it if you've arise in a word for Netflix right um so ultimately\nThis is I think the worry is if if the states or to empower\nThan older than the federal government has no ability to control the way the Internet is structured overall and that's not good for consumers yes I mean the the the most charitable argument for the for the pie FCC's that they're looking out for consumers 'em and you know a lighter touch regulatory framework is better for them\nWell and ... and this and the state of California saying they're no one's looking out for consumers because\nThey're making it so that the consumer approaches the Internet and everything there is on an equal footing a ... a senior editor of finance and influence at Recode\nThanks so much appreciate it Bye bye he

this year and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers walking back to her now\nGlad to be with your Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so much ado about so little I thought the old trade regime between Canada Mexico in the United states was a good one\nAnd this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth major alienation of major allies I Can't imagine these are ... relatively small changes\nThe vast majority of NAFTA is continuing\nAs it was this has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United states\nAnd the important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are tiny compared to the overall economy the ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians\nAnd the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits the ability of North America to remain\nUnified when we face very serious challenges from Asia has been constrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI didn't hear our major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used\nTo go after them have\nBeen quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese on a road\nThis this year and now from NPR WB you are I'm Jeremy hops and\nThere are\nSome voters in Maine putting pressure on Republican Senator Susan Collins as she is seen as one of the key swing votes on whether Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court protests have continued over the past couple of weeks and yesterday nearly two dozen protesters and survivors of sexual assault\nShowed up at ... office in Portland joining us now is Steve missile or chief political correspondent for Maine Public radio he's in Augusta Steve welcome thanks for having me and when you talk to voters in Maine what's the temperature right now how much pressure they putting on Susan Collins\nWell I haven't seen anything like it to be honest with you Jeremy it's you know he's just back up a little bit Centre College has been\nUnder a lot of pressure ever since President Trump was elected president because she was always seen as sort of somebody who might be able to block his worst impulses perhaps and because her reputation as a centrist um and so everybody sort of looking to her on this particular nomination\nI'm as perhaps blocking it and\nYou know who knows if that's going to happen or not but the pressure has been sustained and intense and it's been in and assess specially increased since the sexual assault allegations surfaced earlier last month\nWell but even before the allegations we know that Susan Collins says she's pro choice and many looking for a cabin on say he is somebody who may want to overturn roe versus Wade even though he has said I guess to her privately that he thinks it's settled law\nCorrect yeah and that's that was the initial sort of trigger for the protest or other additional concerns but it it's true that the rover versus Wade question has been sent center of mine for a lot of people and especially women who are expected to be a particularly potent force in the upcoming midterm elections\nAnd she said anything since the testimony last Thursday from Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nNot much I mean the only thing that she said is that she is supportive of the um this FBI probe that is going to dig a little bit deeper into those allegations she has said that but other than that she's really keeping a low profile\n... you know I think probably just waiting for the outcome of that FBI a inquiry to decide how she's going to vote\nNo Maine is a state that is represented in the governor's office by pretty conservative Republican poll the page how much pressure does colon space from conservatives that's a good\nQuestion I mean right now what you're seeing is overwhelming pressure from a progressive groups but lying in wait I suspect if she were to vote against Kavanaugh were even signaled that she would oppose his nomination would be certainly a backlash from conservatives and\nYou know certainly and govern Apollo page has exerted some of that pressure on Collins personally and the past he did it during some key healthcare votes last year\nAnd I would imagine that he would do the same if I'm Shia given any kind of indication that she would oppose Kavanaugh's nomination she hasn't done that yet she's she's struck me as somebody who's been wanting to get to yes on Kavanaugh over the last\nMonth or so but that made you know if something happens what if something comes up during the FBI probe that raises questions for her and she somehow signals that she would oppose him I Would expect that she would see it as much pressure on the on the right as she's been seeing on the left\nSteve missile or chief political correspondent for Maine Public radio see thank you my
