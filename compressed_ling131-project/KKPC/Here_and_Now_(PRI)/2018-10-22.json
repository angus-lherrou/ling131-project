but here it is Taylor Swift or the American Music Awards earlier this month thank you for the\nWord and every single word given out and I\nWere voted on by the people you know what [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo this is worth noting Taylor Swift Instagram post are with a similar theme urging her fans to vote for Democrats in Tennessee it's single handedly caused the surge in online voter registrations across the country the singer kid rock has done similar get out the vote campaign for Republicans\nBut my question is is this the new norm in American politics that in order to get people interested in voting that that a celebrity needs to come out and and push them to do it well\nI Hope not but honestly like registering voters only half the battle you also have to go to the polls so Oregon has gotten rid of voter registration just automatically registered to vote and here in Washington state you can register online like via Facebook and then we've all a hundred percent by mail and for me when I'm Talking to my students like I'd be rate them like we vote by mail there's no excuse\nAnd so for me in my classroom like we vote shame and my students don't like the the

gets them engaged with civics\nUp one aspect of politics I think that we do an injustice with us we paid too much attention to national politics\nAnd so like the presidency and so we spend a lot of my time a lot on my classroom talking about the importance of state government and all the things the government can do and like all the powers that come to the tenth amendment\nAnd one of the things my students walk out of my classroom understanding each year is is that Congress actually has far more power than most Americans think they do and essentially everything that Donald Trump is doing right now if you like it then you should maintain a Republican Congress and if you dislike it you should try to overturn Congress\nI was thinking about um the Parkland high school students in Florida and

engaged in politics and cares\nAbout what's happening I think they're also very skeptical if not cynical about our national politics\nAnd with their part one example you bring up I think that's actually demonstrative of what I was talking about earlier about state politics\nOr the national conversation about gun control policy is basically dead and it doesn't matter what happens there'll be a national movement there is room for movement of the state level and if you look at the Parkland shooting a those kids went to the floor to Capitol at the national capital and so refocusing some of

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy through\nMore than one box only do we have fought for failing to Jen and ... take on prime time with a five minute we can we can live for\nThat day edition sponsored by Google makes all three\nHere and now media analyst John ... joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind the\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and\nThey're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn it let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpot what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second you this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it and\nIt's also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute blocker branded content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nNeighborhoods that you're mentioning these are pretty wealthy neighborhoods I'm surprised that they can't find some fancy store to put into the shops that would be able to afford the rent\nThese are really really fancy neighborhoods is a really really rich neighborhoods are I mean Harold square where I'm sitting right now just by by uh Times Square retail they could see us more than thirty percent\nAre now in flood iron where I work a which is also I guess that's a somewhat of a a ritzy area it's it's about half that so it depends you know which neighborhood exactly you're looking at but overall yes this story here is\nThat in some of the richest neighborhoods in one of the richest cities during an otherwise rich time for the U.S we have this enormous glut\nRetail vacancies and it is really\nReally bizarre and how much of it is about rents going up and how much of it is about Amazon and online shopping in general so\nI see this economic mystery as having three causal variables the first as you said is the rent between two thousand ten and two dozen fourteen commercial rents in the most traffic parts of Manhattan most shocked parts of Manhattan nearly doubled they sorted by eighty nine percent\nSecond and Amazon effect is clearly at play here when I Walk on the Upper East side\nThe kinds of stories that I see that are still filled our salons hair salons nail salons facials eyebrow places and then restaurants\nYou know what are these things all have in common will you can't really do these services online he can't have you can't go on line to Amazon and say I want to visit a hair salon right you have to visit these places where you live there not what economists call tradable sectors\nThe last thing they think is happening is that there's a market cap you have a lot of landlords and Manhattan that are looking for a long term leases to pay these exorbitant rental prices these high least prices\nBut the kind of stores that tend to want to fill these places are newer pop up stores knew were on line e commerce stores\nThey went to experiment with physical retail locations but those those stores you know like a war we Parker that wants to experiment doesn't want to put down at ten twenty year lease they've only been around for three years into this market gap I think it's also contributing to the ...\nIt's so New York is New York a ... it's unlike other cities in this country but I remember when I was there living there during the financial crisis that I saw the same kind of thing you're seeing which is a lot of empty stores very quickly it happened very fast and then of course that did happen\nAround the rest of the country so what does this tell you about what's happening in the rest of America what will happen\nWell first year point it's really interesting I'm looking at a graph right now from the Morgan Stanley airport the you mentioned and in two thousand seven in the fourth quarter she doesn't seven justice the recession was starting um nine percent of New York city ground floor retail was available now it's over twenty percent\nSo as bad as the vacancy seemed to you ten or eleven years ago there were three times worse now I'm ... and two two and a half times worse now I should say\nThe second thing is after I wrote this piece I should say I got more emails tweets letters the Atlantic than I received for maybe any article that I've written all year and the note said to a T this is happening where I live it's happening in Toronto it's happening in London it's happening in San Francisco\nThis does appear to be a side effect of this age of affluence that rents are rising to a level where local retailers cannot breathe and as a result\nThere's space is an occupied by local retailers it's occupied by national retailers will move into that spot your ... your national jewelry brand but I you know other sort of national or corporations that can afford to pay you know can put up for a ten year lease so this really does speak to a change in the fabric of American cities\nAnd just in thirty seconds and I know this is a tough thing to ask him thirty seconds is there any way back from this or is this just the way it's going\nYeah absolutely I mean cities are vibrant and cities have problems that can be resolved and right here in New York City there are people that are trying to fix this problem by\nA passing for example a city vacancy tax so landlords would have to pay a tax for keeping the space vacant for a certain amount of time that's just one idea and surely there'll be more because nobody wants to live in a city where the windows\nAre essentially darkened mirrors for their faces they want to live in

college\nBernie Sanders warn folks that if they don't the Democrats will lose he said in the last midterm elections in twenty fourteen roughly two thirds of Americans did not vote\nAt working people said all lower income people so you know people call us at all young people stayed oh not this time but it's exactly\nI'm overnight but for the most part they're just kind of try to band together and go on for than trying to find places to stay\nNow we've seen these caravans before earlier this year in fact but why is this one this large is it spontaneous or they're you know people behind the scenes are organizing this\n[noise] ah I think it's a bit of both it it definitely start out these these caravans they've done these for years uh quite frankly because\nWhen you're making that long Journey Through Central America it can be an incredibly dangerous thing to do you get a attacked by people on the way I'm I've talked to so many of these migrants who've been through these who told me horror stories of\nRapes of assaults of robberies and so they started these caravan several years ago as a way to protect themselves [noise]\nUm so it was planned to a degree but the size of this is definitely been a bit more spontaneous because um they see the reports of it they say hey this was my chance and they'll run over and enjoying the group\nNow President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on countries like Mexico to do something about this to stop them as they move north clearly government officials from Mexico haven't been able to do that yet have they been trying\n[noise] there's there's been\nDifferent levels of effort let's say I'm the Central American nations Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador um they tried to kind of slow them down a little bit but Mexico now all the focus goes to them now\nSo right now Mexico's in a very difficult position they're getting a lot of heat from the people with in Mexico and Central America to allow these folks to pass\nBut at the same time when you have President Trump I'm kind of hovering over you making these threats threatening to send the military to the border threatening to seal the U.S border which would be economically disastrous for Mexico it's a really tough position for them and they're trying to walk that line\nAnd it does seem like President Trump is trying to in a way use this to his advantage he's telling his Twitter followers that there are criminals and unknown middle Easterners mixed into this group and of course we don't really know if there's any basis\nIn fact for a claim like that but do you think Democrats should be nervous about this caravan heading north just about two weeks before the election when the president is trying to use it to fire up his base when\nYou look at the political aspect of this yes this is this group really the timing of it has been a difficult because it's injected this issue so quickly into the midterms I'm President Trump has not been shy at all he's talking about it all the time Republicans like I can tell you I've been hearing from watching the races are\nIn the middle of America They're talking about the Honduran caravan um there are accusations\nThat democratic operatives that George Soros was behind all this that they're paying for these for these caravan people but [noise] you know I've also talked to some folks who say actually this is it might as well have been paid for by the Republican Party because the idea of showing these images of these folks marching\nTowards the United states as they put it in trying to invade the United states it's been on a constant loop on all sorts of conservative media um it's being used in you know just congressional district debates all over the country in the last few weeks um and so this is something that plays into their hands\nThat said Allen how do you see this plane out if and when thousands of people do arrive at the U.S Mexico border\nWell we'll see a lot of what's been going on where they'll try to get in it and then it becomes a question of how quickly the U.S can process those asylum claims um and and what the resolution of those cases will be\nAll right we'll be watching and

facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races reporter WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe in Germany so Sen Menendez\nTrial for federal corruption ended in a mist trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever sense or at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\nA it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nWas your despite all of that uh there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just drop several million into the race to cement Menendez has lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so what about you and says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob huge and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about judge\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nAbove you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not ties with three times for drugs that those cancer patients politically\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled and less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nBusiness you are now from NPR and WB you are I'm Peter O'Dowd\nAnd filed this next story in the category of I Wish it would have happened to me but it never will the one point six billion dollar mega millions jak pot is still without a winner and so is the six hundred and twenty million dollar Powerball prize\nThe next drawing art Tuesday and Wednesday respectively so you can keep hope alive a little longer I guess just flush singer is business out analyst with CBS News and host of Jill on money her pod cast is better off ... hello first of all let's get this question off the table how many tickets did you buy last week\nYou know I bought zero which means that my odds of winning works exactly zero you will wait [laughter] yeah exactly but I'm going to buy some this week because you know what I like the idea\nThat no this is not my financial plant it is not my retirement plan it is a moment where I can have a ... a little space to just imagine it is written dream it's a couple of bucks to dream that's it\nIt's fun it's also historic good price has never been this big before so why why is it been so high\nYou know the lottery officials both at uh the mega millions and Powerball we're going with the odds a few years ago and they want it to lessen the chance of winning a jackpot so that in turn increases the opportunity for prices to get to really big levels\nAnd then as the money grows to those high figures and more people get in and they want to get part of the action but of course you know the odds are terrible time and the Arab\nWorld you know let's just say them because they're on the odds of winning the mega millions one in three hundred and two million now it's your the odds of becoming a the president of the United states one in ten million the odds of reaching sainthood one and twenty million\nYeah OK well especially with the odds for a Jewish woman to become changes definitely heroes I I think in my odds are better to win the lottery\nI'm OK here's some more fun ones are going to do this just for one second hold on because I'm a geek about numbers\nMy favorite one the odds of dating a super model is eighty eight thousand to one better than they did that that's not bad for on you know I just getting attacked by a shark or like you know one in four million or so and\nYou will get struck by lightning more often than you think one in a hundred and fourteen thousand at odds of dying in an airplane crash one and two hundred thousand so um I think what we're saying is the odds are long but who\nWho who cares it's fun and somebody's going to win right you were a financial planner at one point and you had a lottery winner as a client a blessing or a curse for that person\nComplete blessing I mean it was a curse 'cause it was hard to manage it but like really in the world at large\nThese two people came into my office in Providence Rhode Island\nThey interviewed me and they said oh well you know we just we come into a some money and I conducted the interview as I always do and at the end of the interview they said oh uh um well we should tell you it wasn't because I said what was the inheritance and they said oh it wasn't inheritance I hit the lottery I didn't know how much\nIn my jaundiced way and they said eighty million dollars and I almost fell off my chair anyway they conducted the interview that way they wanted to see what kind of human being I was how he treated other people before they hire a\nReal quickly I Know a lot of people right now are getting their office pools together we did it the here now offers pool one all of two dollars and um so we're going to fight over those sixteen cents but the one of the rules I've heard is put put it down and writing\nYeah I mean absolutely you can put it down and writing and it'll be careful who you go into a pool with and also obviously if you do when you do that kind of keep it under wraps as long as you can because you don't want everybody to know\nYoung Jones was injured business analyst with CBS News and host of Jill on money good luck Jill you're gonna need it I Know\nThank you [laughter]\n[noise]\nElection days around the corner and
