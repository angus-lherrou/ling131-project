changing for him I went to visit Brooks in prison earlier this year he\nSaid his perspective really changed when he started reading a lot in solitary confinement\nAnd I got into a philosophy of it and once I did but it became a thing where I hold her for that knowledge and I spent my just learning\nBrooks also studied several languages learn math and got his GED and he's been taking college classes from prison\nBy all accounts his behavior has been very good he now lives in what's called an incentive unit a it's for inmates who have good behavior\nBurke says he has accepted that he could spend

[laughter] I think like many during this [laughter] so when you learn to look at the universe with eyes of openness and you learn to accept ambiguity it it changes your life forever and that's what this\nShow is about ... everything that we're doing here\nYou grew up in Denver Austin you've guessed conducted for the Colorado Symphony edits comic contribute shows and I understand the symphony or approached you about doing an original production what you through back at them was was anything but traditional\n... well that's kind of my ammo I Try to always go somewhere I've never been my my little catchphrase is when I finish a project\nI like to look back at it and say I didn't know that I knew how to do that and so we had done these live shows we did a red rock show with the video games live\nAnd then I also actually hired them to record two of my soundtracks I did a video game and the movie here in ... flu my whole crew from LA and we'd we'd made it into a recording studio\nAnd hire the full orchestra and so there's been a\nYou know good half decade of partnership there and experimentation and oh for sure so yeah backstage one day they're\nArtistic administrator I'm Tony Blair said if we were to give you an eye on our calendar to do anything you want just out of curiosity what would you make and I I I ... some answer of I've always wanted to make a show or a concert or something that's science and music together and he basically said great\n... the show features a young protecting his called the seeker she lives in a dark forests that kind of terrifying to her but there's a campfire that offers some comfort Tony without giving too much away what can you tell us about the storyline\nSure well one of our very first conversations was about how do we capture what science feels like\nWe don't want electric people we don't want to do it or like here's how black holes at work and let's explain space time that if we wanted to do that or we want to capture raw emotion and the way the human beings have been doing this for centuries is through storytelling\nA specifically through a tradition of storytelling that now we called the classic myth like the Joseph cambell hero's journey\nIt's it's the same type of storytelling tradition that scene in the matrix Star Wars Alice in wonderland lord rings you name it\nSo we're telling a\nMythic story about this young girl and she's afraid of the dark\nShe's alone just like all of us are life she for questions what is out there and the darkness that it's not the dark that is terrifying to it it's what can be hiding in there that we can't see\nShe's in a state where the three most terrifying words are I don't know\nAnd then on his fateful night as her campfires dying and dying and just try to feed it and put stick to the end would and nothing's working and it it it seems to have a mind it but so and in fact we have a little bit of a castaway Wilson thing going on and I want to give too much away\nThe idea of an inanimate object that you can talk to yeah\nOkay and that's not suggestive league kind of talks back okay\n[laughter] I in this night where she's been here for a long time and fires dying dying dying dying and she's at her wits end when out of the woods a man in a bunny suit just coming out of nowhere and he started warming hands up on a little bit your fire\nAnd offers her help if she's willing to go on a journey and take the big risk\nShe decides to go on that journey and what it kicks off is a whole series of encounters where she'll tangle with these larger than life characters all played by the\nSame actor the really brilliant effervescent trade Baker how does a real\nLife scientists weave into this Austin [noise]\nLike a a mentioned earlier the original conceit of the show was basically a purely science plus music concept and and you can almost think of that as a science variety our you know we live in a world where people like Bill Nye and know the grass Tyson it become kind of pop culture icons as the inside baseball term for them as science communicators\nAnd I thought I've always loved those people I admire those people I've worked with some of those people professionally but what really excited me was the idea of hearing from the actual scientists themselves the people who we bring them out of the lab we bring them out of their observatories will bring them out\nBut there are various experimental dens and say let's put you on a stage with an live orchestra and just tell us about what you do and so the secret will encounter a kind of existential question and then\nHas what we're framing as almost like a vision where the lights we'll all go crazy it'll get very colorful and then the scientist comes out with a big fan fares from the orchestra and then they proceed to tell us about their work in a very personalized an autobiographical way\nIt took seven years to reach Saturn and then their teen years [noise]\nParticular measure frozen in alien Muslims [noise]\nThen oh wonders what we saw how was\nIt to work with a scientist so you've got a I'll just read at a rate here a professor of physics at Cal Tech this is Maria ... okay and then Carolyn ... who's well known here in Colorado\nA professor of planetary science at the University of Colorado at Boulder and then Alex Roberts\nProfessor of anthropology and paleo has solid G yeah ancient\nDiseases I guess how how was it to integrate them Tony yeah so you're probably thinking right now like what okay you've got this mythic story going on your side is kind of like what was that one show how was that like what what's going on here and they're animated short by the way yeah there's we have an ad\nWe we uh we integrate animation and and lots of lightning design and we have a um that amazing robotic fire thing you'll just have to see to believe that that Tony built himself at either way I did do myself what I can say is that\nThis is a light in the void is cause most meets a Christmas carol\nPartridge for example are pheasant or\nIn many cookbook interviews that I've done over the years I have always been fascinated by the answer to this question what is Colorado cuisine so you've talked about his connection to you know maybe the outdoors into hunting fishing how how would you answer that\nI think it's probably more generic than that I think it's very much like\nThe tail ended the mid west which because we're going west it's it's a wholesome hardy pretty much healthy food even forty years ago we were one of the reasons the book was so popular as we stress fresh ingredients which Mandarin salad which is the number one popular recipe Mandarin so land doing salad is is\nThe recipe everyone's after\nYes and in the Denver posted a survey ten years ago readers survey and they said what do you think it's going to be I said well it's going to be the man and salad and it was the calls for a can of ...\n... well we didn't have halo is in all the little Mandarin that we now have so you put that in there but we had a lot of stress fresh ingredients that says so at the beginning of the book and I think that's held true and it said the elevation episode of the Midwest you look\nAt an elevation of the Midwest which really is the Rockies right about that part um it's interesting you mentioned elevation because I didn't cooking elevation is a challenge baking especially and I know that you have some cooking tips in the book would you give me an example of a cooking tip it has saved a meal of yours\nWell I think one of the first yeah maybe okay I I had a CD on recently and there was a cooking show the guy said oh this is this great new tip it's going to save you a lot of lot of time\nWhat you do is you partially freeze protein before you want a slice of feeling for the grain balls and all the things that people are eating now\nAt the hands in Colorado the cash forty years ago\nOkay so it's just freeze what the chickens beef\nWhatever yes anything you're going to slice want a slice it really thin or for for heat as are for ... as well I'm thinking chicken\nChicken at ... refrigerator is very hard to sliced thinly it's chew weekly doesn't work that way so just having that light freeze\nBut in the fridge for twenty twenty minutes depending on how big a portion of protein is and then it just fly to utilize that really then yeah but that's it that's the other hand as a hand in the entree section in Colorado cash\nAnd it was also a news item on a cooking show a couple of weeks ago\nThanks for joining us what\nDo you think you're going to cook next I'm actually going to make is hard to say pikes peak spiked apple Chris which is a recipe from cash but this white part is grandma or gay and

that is in line with what Tesla told investors to expect so that's one promise kept in a much\nYou did break after mosques decision on Saturday to step down as chairman of Tesla\nAnd pay a fine for tweeting about his plan to take the company private lots to talk about here so it's bringing Claire Sebastian she's a business correspondent for CNN and she joined us now from New York Hi Claire Hi didn't Tesla has struggled a lot to hit production goes over the years we've talked about that here on the show\nSo how big of a deal is this news that it's finally hit that mark\nWell let's get knees you know this is something that they really needed frankly and like the recent questions over that credibility particularly when it comes to communications with the market and you know unless it\nWas very bullish about this over the weekend he sent a message we know to to stop an email saying that he needed to give it one will push and they were very close to profitability in times of whether this means they will get profitability that down and the therapist divided on that some say that that it does show you know that this this is a helpful or\nYou know data point in the past would have been at the others are worried about the challenges the company is facing when it comes to deliveries we know that must be in the past has those about production hell now he's been talking about delivery logistics how he called it ... and that did show up in the number the bet they have a battle of the vehicles lifted in transit about twelve thousand of them that's less than the last quarter\nBut still a significant number so I think that's why we see for the second day running now after that initial busted enthusiasm on Monday the stock price is down\nAnd just to note about profitability tough was never had a profitable year\nThat that's true and and at there at the silk questions hanging over this yeah mosque has promised repeatedly that that in that cool down the fourth quarter they will show a profit and they will be cash flow positive and they said he said the topic of the weekend we're very close to that and they've been cutting costs as well as increasing production they've laid off nine percent of that stuff\nThat we saw recently that they reduce some of the color options available for the motives three to cut costs as well but but Castro is still a big issue for this company they put that coming Jupiter in November and some next year so they're getting to profitability sent me from the enlisted covered this that I've been speaking to a is not something that they see as guarantee\nYou listed a lot of the reasons why the headlines about Tesla are often negative so let's talk about this one earlier or the SEC settled a with you on a mosque after he had this tweet the clean do you have the funding secure to take Tesla private\nThere are reports that must have threatened to resign at one point if the board decided to settle so some last minute change of heart some drama do you think that to us a Tesla in mosques are ready to put that behind them I mean do you think it will do much long term damage\nI think they were extremely ready to do it but that behind and we saw how much of an overhang hadn't stuck by the fact that it went up Seventeen percent on Monday or though they said it has come back down again that's not the only way behind they have there's still a department of justice investigation that that is hanging over then that could potentially lead to criminal charges although some experts I spoke to said\nThat the settlement with the SEC potentially makes that less likely that things are going to be there is not ready on the board there being questioned throughout all of this about their independence we know that there are several

Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cash treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like lassie Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friends now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies

we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault\nUm so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flash back you know somebody

Windsor Johnston the White House continues to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who's facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct press secretary Sarah Sanders is accusing Democrats of derailing the confirmation process from the start\nOn the President Trump nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh Senator Schumer declared that Democrats would oppose this nomination with everything they had\nFor a single document which produce a single meeting with the senator for hearing was ever scheduled Chuck Schumer the Senate Democrats telegraphed a strategy to throw the kitchen sink at the judge with no regard for the process decency or standard stay\nFBI isn't the net stopped conducting a supplemental background investigation into the claims made against cabin all the agency is expected to release its findings by the end of the week Senate Republicans are pushing for a full vote on his confirmation by that and\nPresident Trump is taking to social media to push back against a scathing report published and the New York times NPR's Scott Horsley says the article reports that Trump and his family used to be a scheme to or they taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars in inherited wealth\nThe New York times fourteen thousand words story was the product of more than a year of investigation it shows that despite his claims to be a self made billionaire President Trump was the beneficiary of a vast inherited fortune much of which was shielded from taxes through a variety of questionable schemes\nNew York taxing authorities say they're reviewing the articles findings\nIn his tweets the president does not dispute any of the facts and the article but describes it as quote a very old boring and often told ... piece Trump complains the vast majority of the newspapers coverage of his administration has been negative echoing a charge leveled by the White House press secretary Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nThe death toll from last week's magnitude seven point five earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia now surpasses fourteen hundred NPR's Julie McCarthy is in the city of ... near the epicenter\nAs you enter the city of ... there is a all kinds of signs of\nDistress and frustration but not violence or unrest do you feel\nYou feel that there is a um a a sense of desperation people are holding signs up saying we need help to we need food and you have little children chasing the cars and people are throwing out their food at them\nThis regulation what caused nine point six billion dollars but with health benefits are about ten times that to the Trump Administration they don't believe that a lot of the pollutants that were used to come to that benefit figures should really be counted and uh you know only mercury should be counted\nSo I Want to make sure that I'm clear here the change that we are talking about would not allow the EPA to consider the health benefits of reducing pollution that's something that the industry calls co benefits right exactly well\nYou know this current administration they believe that they directly regulated substances in this case mercury and some other\nToxic air pollutants the benefits to from this regulation to reducing those should be considered by when you shut down coal fired power plants who also reduce particulate matter nitrogen oxides other things that\nAre really have a big public health impact in this administration doesn't believe those should be considered so when you change that cost benefit analysis it really has the potential down the road to either prevent this regulation from from getting stronger or a a potentially even to repeal it in the future\nThere is a tie here as there is a the last couple of days on many stories in the news do Brett Kavanaugh hum in two thousand and fourteen the coal industry sued to roll back this mercury regulation and it lost in the U.S court of appeals in Washington DC\nWell judge Kavanaugh who serves on that court wrote the dissenting opinion and he argued that the mercury will was too expensive\nFor the coal industry so if Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court he could be ruling on this case if if it goes that far\nExactly you know and and his whole record on the DC circuit has been somewhat skeptical of high cost regulations\nUm he specifically looked at co benefits the the pollutants that happened to be reduced from regulation yeah he he didn't believe it should be counted which would have made it a and not cost effective regulation\nSo those are two major rule changes that the Trump Administration is considering but there are many more ah I'm seen um the industry is getting a big win on a methane roll back potentially what else are you watching here\nYeah so the administration is on sort of a a big a regulatory rollback streak in these last couple of months ... PA is working on\nA repealing Obama's administration standards to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas drilling that said potent greenhouse gas hum button so many corners of this ah masturbation on environmental policy their\nRobots coming I'm you know the clean Power Plan limiting carbon dioxide pollution from power plants the clean water rule um you know so so many other regulations left and right that in these last couple of months are moving towards either repeal or a significant role back\nInto who's behind all this because I'm sure that this is exactly what industry wants to see\nRight a lot of these changes are driven by industry and I either because of previous litigation or lobbying or what have you ah for example Murray energy is one of the biggest coal mining companies in the United states its chief executive Bob Murray as a strong support our President Trump\nHum the current acting administrator of the EPA Andrew wheeler used to lobby for Murray energy um but also a lot of industry groups national mining association American Petroleum Institute and the like they are largely behind a lot of this but they're also things that the Republican Party and the Trump Administration of support for awhile\nTimothy game of energy and environment reporter at the hill and thanks for taking the time to to speak with us about this for ... and Peter and you're listening to here in um\n\nMetro weather turns sunny and warm or today before cooling off again for the end of the week\nThis new CPR news highs near eighty this afternoon than down into the sixties tomorrow and friday then only in the fifties where the metro area for the weekend it was cooler temperatures come with rain tonight and Thursday\nColorado Springs eighties today and sixties tomorrow near Ninety in Pueblo then much cooler Thursday there was more rain for Grand Junction and high today near Seventy and mountain highs new sixty\nI'm sharing property in the White House press briefing today reporters asked press secretary\nSarah Sanders what the administration mean specifically in claiming a major New York times report is inaccurate Sanders said the story is a false attack based on old recycled news the times says Trump received at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father starting when the president was a toddler\nAnd the times asserts that some of that came from outright fraud\nThat each Jersey Supreme Court today dismissed more than five hundred lawsuits against the maker of an acne drug that caused some patience to develop a gastrointestinal disease the court said that Hoffman la Roche had provided adequate warnings about the side effects and ...\nA rare outbreak of red tide along Florida's Atlantic Coast just keeping beaches closed until friday red tide caused by algae and his comment on Florida's Gulf Coast listening to here and now\n[noise] low\nSupport comes from Europe that Colorado based I wear galleries for thirty five years in cherry creek north Greenwich Village flat and marketplace Colorado Springs and Aspen growth on line at your optics dot net your ethics the art and optic\nSupport comes from the muzzle arts and culture center presenting the eleventh annual news that GM festival October for through November Eighteenth featuring Jewish art authors movies and music M.
