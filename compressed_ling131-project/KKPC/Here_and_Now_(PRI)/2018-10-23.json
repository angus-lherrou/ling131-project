Charlie Baker is the most popular governor in America again a Republican in Massachusetts He's facing Democrat Jay Gonzales and at last check is almost forty points ahead of him in the polls\nAnthony Brooks is senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston he joins us by Anthony hey journalist and why is a Republican like they are so popular in Massachusetts well\nWhen it comes down to is that he represents a brand of Republicanism that works really well in Massachusetts is relatively conservative on fiscal issues he doesn't like raising taxes but he's liberal on social issues like abortion rights and marriage equality\nAnd he works well with the state legislature which is dominated by Democrats so in this age of hyper partisanship across the country Baker represents something very different that appeals not only to Republicans in the state but according to ... to lots of Democrats and independents\nAs well you'd probably call him a Democrat if you were in any other state here is in a recent debate with chickens I was talking about issues that matter to him a where he has to go against the president\nAnd I've always been quite clear about where I stand on a whole series of things with respect to the president and managed to work pretty hard over the course of the past four years to stop some of the things that the Congress and the president was proposing that

big democratic programs raise taxes on the rich invest billions and transportation education\nProvide tuition free college and move toward single payer health care system\nBaker is much more cautious I kind of cautious fiscal manager presents himself as a responsible custodian of government a government for example he's made modest investments in early childhood education an effort to fix the T the state's public transportation system but he opposes the kind of big tax hikes and big programs that ...\nIs trying to remind people that Baker is in fact Republican listen to this moment from that

and it became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal\nNow ... trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and and this does put her in a kind of awkward position this socially liberal anti Trump Republican who says he'll vote for Jeff deal the state's number one Trump supporter the guy who co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts does Baker have a relationship with President Trump no\nThis this year and now from NPR and W.

Honduras El Salvador that made a lot of money every year we give a bar and they did nothing for us nothing the u._s.\nWill send one hundred and eighty million dollars to those three countries combined in twenty Nineteen alley\nBill she has MSNBC anchor and economics correspondent he's also the co host of ... and rule alley always good to have you made her so first let's be clear any significant change to that hundred and eighty million dollar funding stream is not just up to the president he'd he'd have to go to Congress and get them involved to\nGrade have to go to Congress for half of it because Congress passed legislation last year that allows up to twenty five percent of the aid that goes to those countries to be withheld if the secretary of state doesn't certified a Congress that they're making progress reducing illegal immigration so half a twenty five percent can be held that way\nBut up to fifty percent of it can be withheld if the administration determined that the countries\nHave run afoul of anti corruption provisions so there are a couple of technicalities but they can actually the administration can withhold up to fifty percent of the aid that goes to these countries without Congress\nOkay and by the way that one hundred and eighty million dollars is already less than what the us morality in past years\nThat's right ah in fact foreign aid for the three countries the president's talking about his forty percent less than what was allocated in two thousand sixteen so they're already getting a lot less funding from the U.S than they did a also you know the president's trying to push each of these three countries to enact reforms to\nIncrease private investment so they're not as dependent on government money and stem the flow of immigrants and he's also a made a decision to cancel temporary work permits and legal status for about two hundred and fifty thousand Salvadorans Hondurans who are already in the United states this hurts those countries because\nThey depend so heavily unwritten Minton says from people who work overseas who then send money home\nAnd I'm taking a look at where the foreign aid goes goes to programs that help reduce poverty in the country's help reduce violence help reduce food insecurity those are the very problems that force people to migrate north in the first place could the president be making the problem worse\nFor himself yeah absolutely or he could be that the the new one sophisticated view of this is that\nThere are problems in particularly Nicaragua which is about to collapse and further south in Venezuela so there's a there's a bit of a refugee asylum economic problem all through south and Central America right now and you know the same way the Syrians in Iraqi is go to European countries\nThat kind of the problem we've got here we sort of need to try and figure out what this problem looks like in the host countries and with Mexico who maybe in exchange for certain incentives might be able to settle more of these people but yeah doing it this way cutting this funding or it will only exacerbate the problem\nBut could the threat and be a big enough stick for those countries who don't want to see that money not show up in their coffers do to get them to do something more to to keep those migrants at home\nThat's definitely the approach Donald Trump is taking with kind of every issue that he's dealing with the you know more more sticks than carrots we haven't heard from anything from these three countries that we don't know whether they're considering policy changes\nThere is a technical problem because by treaty citizens of Honduras El Salvador Guatemala can move freely within each country without a passport so you can't prevent them from leaving the country very few countries actually prevent people from leaving\nA so if we don't know yet what they're going to do MSNBC is alley bill she thank you my pleasure this year now\n\nElection days around the corner and Colorado Public radio is here to bring you a broad picture at how this election will affect the day you get a better understanding of what other Coloradans are thinking about visit C.

voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or making promises that they will continue one of the most popular parts of the law\nMaking sure people with preexisting conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance the Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled but a majority of voters wants to protect coverage for pre existing conditions joining us now is Julie Rovner who is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Hi Julie\nHey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in twenty ten who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions\nWell if you were going from job to job if you're an employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either exclusions are being charge more as long as he didn't have a break of more than sixty three days I was in Nineteen Ninety six law that Congress that\nWhat the Affordable Care act did was that extended it to people who basically left their jobs for their own insurance who wanted to leave to start a business or who were people who work for themselves\nOr or kids graduating from college and going off their parents' plans the idea was that people should be able to get insurance regardless of whether they had a pre existing condition and they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act\nBut back ... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nOr possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to get insurance but it wouldn't cover your pre existing condition so there were there were a lot of sort of pitfalls if you were trying to buy your own insurance and you had been basically treated for a medical condition sometimes as minor as an acne\nSo at this point with some of the dismantling that has been done to be Affordable Care act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right ... basically if you want health insurance no matter what your pre existing condition is in this country you can get it\nIt is a it is still in place however there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise]\nPretty much any time or the lawsuit suggest that because of the tax bill last year that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance\nThe entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down the Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite agree with striking down the whole uh for Bill Carrick but maybe they should strike down the preexisting condition protections so even though Congress didn't change it there is still some threat that it could be changed in the court\n... well that brings us to the bigger picture here which is that how can you say that you want to keep that one popular provision of the Affordable CARE Act which is the production for pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take little pieces of it away\nWell originally told us when they decided to create these lotteries\nThat the money would be going as additional funding to public education so even if you lose which you're most likely going to at least the money is going to go to some good causes is going to help your children how to better education but that's not exactly what happened\nAnd what do you mean because we're reading that about half of the states put their lottery profits towards education but it's often not always seen as extra money in fact in many cases it's it's like making up the basic revenue stream for the state's education budget is that right\nExactly we originally thought this was going to go to find wonderful programs increase spending her students but instead it's really jak funding the education budget for example in North Carolina and two thousand and five\nAt the last second before the vote they switched the wording from needs to go to additional funding for education too it's at the discretion of the state legislatures which means in most states spending per people is actually down even though the lottery profit has skyrocketed\nCoot you argue then that the lottery is essentially attacks because that is the way that state would traditionally funded education budget\nI think that's a perfect argument and especially sad given that really this you know lotteries are are are played by the absolute lowest earners in our society\nThat average lowest starting household spends four hundred and Fifteen bucks on the lottery every year in comparison to the highest earners which spend about a hundred dollars so that means the lowest earners are spending four times what the highest earners are spending meaning it's really attack on the poor\nIt's not just education that lottery money goes toward a we see in Colorado that it goes for environmental protection what are some other examples\nUm sometimes it can go to the VA it can go for I mean really I mean it can go to a general budget and North Carolina they actually the governor just accept the million dollars and put it towards the general budget so it's a really loose wording in many states with what exactly the money can go to\nWhat are the implications for using money in that way is it as good as any other stream of revenue\n[noise] well I guess you can argue it in many different ways but you know gambling addiction is a real issue in our country and especially when it's this tax on the poor and they have in effect attacks on the poor ... it's a really worrisome time and that's also really worrisome that legislatures are in some ways\nAt the mercy of the lot out and really needed to make money and that's actually what happened in twenty Seventeen in order to make these jackpot bigger that we're talking about it like we are today they made it a lot harder to win the jackpot switch skyrocket\nSo are you saying that just because this is a record jackpot that we're looking at with this mega millions at one point six billion dollars that states are we being even more money or is it staying the same\nThe states they're raping more money but our education budget certainly is not in most states\nHuh you write that about half of Americans play the lottery today compared to almost Seventy percent in the Nineteen eighties what's going on with that\nI think people are getting smarter about how low their chances are\nYou know if I tell you a chance of winning the mega millions as one in three hundred million that means nothing to you\nBut if I tell you that the same as your chance of flipping a coin thirty times in a row and getting a heads every time or your three more times more likely to be killed by a vending machine than you are winning the mega millions it starts to make a lot more sense we are getting smarter\nSo what's your take away is the lottery a good thing for states and for all those\nI think it really begs the question about whether lotteries are good thing and I think what's very worrisome as having state legislator sort of at the mercy of lottery funding\nOn that note I did buy a ticket I Know I should but I did and I will be checking the numbers tonight so I Am just as guilty as anyone else\nHey it's a complicated world we live in right you know you can say one thing to do another sometimes liberty bitter is a visiting\nAssistant professor in the kitchen Washington University in St Louis but he thinks she's on
