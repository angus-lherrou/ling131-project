on any school district job site early childhood education instructor professional registered nurse professional preschool group leader professional instructional teacher temporary and there's so many unfilled positions from bus drivers to math teachers districts can't afford to pay higher salaries\nWe spend about twenty eight hundred dollars per student below even just the national average\nKerry Kennedy a Democrat and former Colorado State treasurer backed amendments Seventy three\nThis would be the most significant investment in education in three decades it would reverse almost Thirty years of cuts in education funding\nSince the recession state lawmakers have withheld seven point four billion dollars from Colorado schools to shore up other parts of the state budget the hemorrhage of cash has left many districts operating at two thousand eight funding levels Kennedy says amendments Seventy three would stop the bleeding\nHalf of the school districts in Colorado today have cut back to a four day school week that is unacceptable in a state with a top economy in the nation\nThe constitutional amendment would fund full day kindergarten for all children would target millions more to preschool education gifted students and students with disabilities local districts would decide where to spend the rest of the money Michael fields is with Colorado rising action a group that advocates conservative principles\nThis was a one point six billion dollar tax increase and really you have no guarantees about student outcome\nField says it's about more than setting goals for higher test scores social and emotional development and workforce training he wants this question answered before there's any more money\nWhat are we getting out of the education system and can be prioritize our budget\n\nMiddle school teacher Bridget Goodwin recently joined teachers to support amendments Seventy three\nI don't know financially and continue to you again and then you need to

thirty four thirty five students in their class and kids in school with ... mental health Adam\n... recounts there's eight hundred and sixty five really rough\nSo how exactly would Seventy three raise the one point six billion income taxes would\nRise on top earners those making between a hundred and fifty and two hundred thousand would pay eighty one more dollars a year\nBut if you make more than a million you'll pay an extra twenty four thousand in taxes Kerry Kennedy says it would rebalance the tax code that has middle income earners paying a higher percentage of their income on taxes so\nNinety two percent of the people here in Colorado would not pay a higher income tax under a man that Seventy three just the top eight percent\nFor Michael fields of Colorado rising action the income tax I think it would hurt the economy he and Luke rag one with the conservative education reform group ready Colorado I think it could hurt some small businesses that pull in more than five hundred thousand dollars in income when\nThose high net worth small businesses and individuals face those large taxes they go elsewhere there's some of the most ... people in society\nCorporations would also pay higher taxes the rate going from four point six five to six percent Michael field says there are just too many unknown\nWhat is going on what are we going to do I was going to impact us I think those studies need to have them beforehand or supporters\nThat time is now to make the funding system bearer Kerry Kennedy says Colorado would remain competitive\nRight now we have the third lowest corporate income tax in the country and amendment Seventy three would bring us to the ninth lowest corporate income taxes in the country\nThere is another provision in the proposal that has to do with property taxes backers argue Seventy three ... property tax relief to farmers ranchers and homeowners by lowering and stabilizing the school portion of local property taxes\nOpponents worry that change may hurt cities counties and water and fire districts by putting downward pressure on the local taxes they rely on\nEducators say Colorado's schools are on the brink with rising inequality between school districts amendments Seventy three they say would level the playing field\nAnd journey renting joins us now Hogan journey although Ryan's your stories on school finance including amendment Seventy three prompted many\nQuestions from our audience and why don't we start with Barbara Brett\nShe heard your earlier interview with a recent high school grad who wanted to know if the teacher protests had any impact on increasing school funding and in that discussion you explained why Colorado schools keep asking for money so I think it's important to lay that out first before we go to Barbara specific question yeah\nIn shorts state lawmakers began withholding money from public schools during the recession to balance the budget school districts across the states they cut staff in programs and some of those haven't come back who the cumulative debt or shortfall to Colorado schools is seven point four billion dollars\nThis year alone it's an eight hundred and thirty million dollar shortfall so think of it like in Iowa you state ... schools money because the constitution requires a certain level of funding every year\nAnd lawmakers took billions during the recession from schools to pay for other areas of the budget that we're strapped to state lawmakers have not been able to pay that back I\nKnow this winter they did make a hundred and fifty million dollar dent in the aisle you for the upcoming budget ear the schools have said we're at the breaking point we can't continue to operate like this we've got to go to voters and try to get back to the funding levels we had when the great recession started in two thousand eight so in ...\nAmendments Seventy three this attempt to raise one point six billion dollars in funds for schools and let's listen to what Barbara Brett asked you she said she can't understand with the relationship is between Seventy three and this I always use more than seven billion dollars taking other schools\nJust no money for the schools [noise] why don't we get the seven billion out of the states you know repay the system how to citizens know that it's going to go\nPublic schools and not be used for roads and bridges like apparently the seven million was\nThe question is an excellent one it made me do some research first it's more appropriate to talk about the yearly debts and not the whole seven billion but let's just take the eight hundred and thirty million dollar shortfall it's called the budget stabilization factor by the way it has been impossible to pay that back with existing state revenue\nWhat happened is when the economy is good revenue limits under Taber the taxpayer bill of rights kick in and taxpayers get a rebate instead of going to pay off the aisle you and basically the state does not have an extra eight hundred and thirty million to give schools\nOr some would argue that the political will to find a solution to this funding crisis it's not there okay and back to him at Seventy three make the connection to the debt [noise]\nYes and that meant backers would argue that the one point six billion dollars it would raise is is really a modest ask compared to the cumulative lost his schools over a decade\nAmendment Seventy three would eliminate the early debt owed to schools and they would begin to add revenue districts are also struggling because I I should say during this time lawmakers passed many requirements on schools for example\nA you've got to do these new strict teacher evaluations new academic standards but they gave virtually no extra funding to implement them\nSo districts would be paid back to some extent under amendment Seventy three\nYes supporters say the measure would give each and every district what's owed to them from that yearly I owe you\nPlus it makes some changes like making sure additional dollars go to districts that are serving students with high needs give us more specifics about what Seventy three would pay for yeah so a few more details that weren't in the radio story that just aired the amendments specifies that the amount of per pupil funding would go up to Seventy three hundred dollars\nA certain groups of students would get funding booth special education gifted and talented students English language learners and some more money for pre school funding every kindergartner would get a have access to full day schooling and the rest will go to local district many see their top priority is teacher salaries\nBut she has any well\nYes Ah yes three\nBags full one for them is\nTo run for the day and\nThen we could go on you [laughter]

were intercepted by the secret service during routine screening procedures\nThe suspicious devices come as political tensions run high ahead of the November midterm elections President Trump has repeatedly referred to Democrats as an angry mob while political figures on both sides of the aisle have faced threats of violence Ayesha Rascoe NPR News Washington\nOh no absolutely well I think in response to your question Robert I Believe first of all I've been a little disappointed to that I have not heard Democrats stand up and say this is bunk I mean these are people who are seeking a better life and very few of them are going to make it through the borders they make up to the border\nAnd we haven't we haven't heard that I think the I I'm not speaking for democratic leaders but I think the reason is\nThat Donald Trump is clearly trying to make this the issue in the campaign he said the campaign is all about the caravan and Kavanaugh and common sense and I think they see that as a trap they don't want to walk into it because he was trying to make them look like they are for open borders and they're trying to ...\nThe focus on the economy and on health care particularly\nUh end on what Mitch McConnell talked about last week that if you leave put the Republican to leave the Republicans in power they'll go after Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security I think that's where Democrats would they'd rather focus on that and they don't want to be dragged and that would be ...\nI think that add it if if I can that ad but those key points to Democrats for tax hikes open borders socialized medicine that is a a common\nA issue or common message that has driven up against many\nA Democrat specifically in the Senate races and there's not a lot of pushback because that is a there's a lot of truth to that in in terms of where the Democrats than but let me just say this one quick thing on on the caravan that this administration issue and I couldn't disagree on that right\nThat's why I cannot say [laughter] but I think a lot of\nRaise taxes to pay for education for instance I mean we've been hearing that today but go ahead go\nAhead yeah just on on the care of and that the administration has mentioned that's and I think it's a valid point\nDemocrats policies of catch and release and the loop holes with regard to those policies are an incentive for people to come into this country granted a lot of people in the caravan are seeking asylum they are fleeing\nA danger in their home country but many of them come to this country because they know once they step one show in America\nThey are the chances of them being sent back home if if there's a request is not granted it's minimal and that has a large in large part due to the Democrat catch and release policy once they're here\nIf I may just step up with the fact is Donald Trump has been talking about to board or if you look at the end by the administration's own numbers more people have been coming to the border despite Donald Trump's tough talk uh than than we're a year ago and I want to put the character and mistrust in perspective\nJust this is calmed down everybody this is the second Caribbean this year the one in April Fifteen hundred people made it\nTo the American border two hundred and fifty applied for asylum of who three\nThree people were given a silent this is not and the salt on our country\nAnd the other well they'd here in America is worried and worried pointing out that if they were to walk the whole time and not sleep it would still get them more than a month to

New York what more do we learn\nA there was a little news ah first that are in that package containing a device which they described as a pipe bomb type device\nAt the CNN headquarters the the packaging also contained a white powder and they don't know what that is yeah there have been a recent\nA letter sent with white powder to the White House in the Pentagon which turned out not to be deadly but they are certainly a a matter of concern so they have still they had still closed down in the mail room at that building and the time to try and analyze that powder also as you mentioned governor Andrew Cuomo announced mid press conference\nThat he had received a device to his office which was being handled and I should add that NPR's just confirmed that former attorney general Eric Holder or as also received a device which was intercepted\n... okay so so we're talking about Cuomo a Democrat holder a also a Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz also a a Democrat and obviously Hillary Clinton and a former President Obama is law enforcement in New York saying anything about whether the risk goes on whether anybody else is at risk here\nUm I mean they were trying not to a point out what I think than most people are drawing as a conclusion that the targets are ah are either progressive voices like billionaire philanthropist George Soros who received a a an explosive device at his home earlier this week and all the others you just mentioned\nUm but yeah that that seems to be the conclusion people are drawn connecting the dots increase in law enforcement and security around the city now\nYes they're announcing that there would be uh you would probably see more police on the corners et cetera but mostly they were stressing that a New York city has been through a lot of things like this at say it's twenty five years since the Nineteen Ninety three World Trade center bombing us so they said New York has seen worse\nAnd and that people should go about their daily lives there is no specific information about any additional threat\nAt let's listen to a little clip from the press conference in New York this is a Mayor Bill de Blasio\nWas or say this to haul public officials of all partisan affiliations don't encourage violent [noise] don't encourage hatred don't encourage attacks on media [noise] you can disagree but you have to show respect for people and air disagreements peacefully\nThese attacks or or attempted attacks I should say are coming just before the midterm elections are as we mentioned several of these packages were address to Democrats are progressive voices can we make any guesses at this point about the source um really that so far\nMost of them have been the focus in the past of right wing conspiracy talk online on the radio ah Debbie Wasserman Schultz was of course featured in the weekly leaks trove of emails that was released to it which embarrassed to the Democratic party before the last presidential election\nAnd uh so and that that's what made the conclusion many people are drawing but but not a not police not authorities they're saying that they're just going to wait and see and I should say that already some of these right wing conspiracy theorist ... online are starting to say that this could be a a this could be a ploy by the Democrats to distract\nHad before she's watching Quil Lawrence thank you this is

the incoming president we start with Doug so when it comes to work is just give me that some of the problem that you're seeing and getting workers here\nIn two thousand seven recession we lost fifty percent of our industry and they have not return and found other work so as things if the backup we're still working with half\nOur workforce a lot of people left the industry and then I'm Mark you're left with people who might have aged out of the industry retired\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact our average aged framing contractor is fifty seven years old\nSo can you give me the kinds of jobs you are missing right now\nEvery trade is who are missing from drywall are still plumbers to office staff\nIn the construction industry if you talk to any company they are looking for help and they can't find it ended up\nWhat's what some of the side effects what happens as a result of not having enough workers\nFrom my general contractors perspective the homes that used to take us three to four months to build now they're taking six to eight months\nAnd I'm sure that your bits have to be higher than\nThey do they have to we have to recover that cause but you still you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last three years probably thirty percent\nAre you worried about materials coming up even more about ...\nTariffs and hurricanes absolutely\nLeno send us email as several times a day of those looking from Mary in Panama City to all these places needing their homes to be rebuilt or repaired and you know I'm thinking to myself week we struggled day to day to keep up with what we have had prior to the storm\nWe I mean physically I mean there's a new housing new has just struggling with balancing act bouncing it how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo in order to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who have been hurt by Michael\nThe lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of rivers and a lot of unlicensed activity\nWhat else uh the workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe increase benefits\nIf there's not enough plumbers in town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of work than when they did the jobs they raise their prices because they know there's no one else to come in to take the work or if mark\nThat have been developed over the last twenty five years and so at this point we can actually make a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in many patients has any\nProgress being made in the search for a cure\n[noise] we've made a lot of progress at this point we have\nSome very promising therapies that attempt to remove or prevent the accumulation of some of the abnormal proteins that seem to be associated with this disease\nSome of those medications have not worked as well as we'd hoped um but I think that we are on the cusp of developing some very new and highly effective therapies there's\nAlso some new research out there about what may prevent people from getting old timers what is the latest research tell us about that\nWell that's a very exciting area of development now we are testing numerous approaches so one of the most exciting is to use\nSome of the same type of compounds that have been a proposed for treatment but they give them much earlier in the disease and so if we can prevent the accumulation of these abnormal proteins\nThan the hope is that we can either stave off the illness or even stop it in its tracks the other approach that a lot of us are very interested in is can we use lifestyle approaches to modify the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease can we\nUse things like physical exercise dietary approaches\nAnd other kinds of activities that we think will a lower the risk of developing this disease and what are the answers to those questions\nWell they're still being worked on unfortunately so we have a lot of\nData that correlates you know someone exercising with the reduced risk of Alzheimer's but we haven't proven it yet in a go forward way we haven't shown that if you start an exercise program that you yourself will have reduced risk but I think that there is accumulating evidence\nThat a lot of these lifestyle factors and biological interventions may really pay dividends\nNow Sandra Day O'Connor said yesterday that she has been a feeling the early stages of dementia and likely has Alzheimer's disease what is the difference at this point\nWell dementia is a broader syndrome of which there are many causes and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia but it's not the only one\nIf you were a family member of Sandra Day O'Connor right now would you think that you yourself would be at higher risk of getting dementia or getting old timers disease because she\nHas it [noise] well uh miss O'Connor is eighty eight as you pointed out earlier and so we would characterize her as having what we call late onset Alzheimer's disease\nAnd late onset Alzheimer's disease seems to have less genetic load if you will or less genetic links who's then early onset disease and so I Would personally not field or at this point that\nThat wouldn't necessarily make one more likely to develop this disease than the general population\nWhen I ask you one more question is there a difference in what we're seeing right now between women and men when it comes to Alzheimer disease\n[noise] we do see evidence that women are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease\nAnd uh we think that's a very interesting fact it's true that women live longer than men on average but even when you adjust for that women have a somewhat higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than men\nThat is Dr Paul Newhouse director of the center for cognitive medicine at Vanderbilt University medical center talking with us about dementia and Alzheimer's disease

the opposite leave hardly any olives at all\nNow imagine the odds are Democrats and the tomatoes are Republican or vice versa that's gerrymandering\nAnd and that's a huge problem for our democracy\nThat's Michael ... he's a redistricting expert at NYU Brennan Center for justice\nBy no means or the Rocky Mountains or worst states um but you know the the problem with ... is one that has been growing and it's one that is getting worse\nMe says when state legislatures are in charge of drawing of district maps it's kind of like letting the Fox design the hen house\nIt's sort of counter

probably have unambiguously the most thoughtful gerrymandering reform initiative in America\nThat may be an exaggeration so I asked Michael e will these measures in Utah and Colorado prevent gerrymandering in those states\nYes if they pass they will be models for for states around the country\nMost importantly he says both measures would make partisan gerrymandering illegal right now it isn't\nThe Supreme Court has deadlocked on the issue repeatedly and so right now there really is it a way to go into court and say this map is unfair this map as a partisan gerrymander\nBoth of these measures would make that possible so even if an evil mastermind found a way to game the system and get those regular citizens to gerrymander voters would have a way to fight back\nBut yes that that's huge the ability to go to court is is absolutely huge um and it's part of a growing trend\nWhen that is especially relevant right now the twenty twenty cents is is right around the corner and when

I'm Jeremy hops and hurricane willow weekend to a tropical depression as it moved inland over west central Mexico this morning but it could bring extreme weather\nTo parts of the U.S as it crosses the border Jeff Hoffman is director and chief meteorologist of the Florida public radio emergency network Hi Geoff oh good afternoon jamming now this storm was a category five storm on Monday when it hit it had weekend how powerful was it\nUh yeah I certainly a ... a top storm in terms of its intensity and of course landfall there and Mexico or was not good news but NATO's dissipated entirely over the mountains so that is good news but certainly uh I think in terms of ah the pressure to fall once again it was in the top five in the Pacific of course the ah\nAh the specialist will be analyzing the exact numbers that when it came ashore based on some of the damage\nSo when it crosses into the U.S I guess the first place it will hit is Texas and a lot of rain is expected\n[noise] yeah it's no longer a tropical system per se but there's this remnant pull of moisture uh that's moving into Texas that's actually occurring today so a lot of rain for areas that don't need it especially in the hill country there in Texas\nUm but also more rain will be upstream from this as well as it as it meets up with it a little cold front coming in from the central us in an area of low pressure is expected to develop in the Gulf\nAnd uh we're preparing for some significant rain in the panhandle in Florida a obviously a recovery efforts continue there with a from hurricane Michael and this will continue up to the northeast\nAnd tell us about that what is expected for the northeast 'cause it looks as you look at the forecast for the northeastern part of the United states looks like it's going to be a pretty significant storm a even a nor'easter\nYeah could be a member a nor'easter is not necessarily a term for just a snowstorm in in in New England\nUh it has to do with the pressure falls in the strength of the system and that north east when and that will be intense the good news is a fourth floor eight Floridians and the Carolinians uh that are recovering from both Florence and Michael ... and the the rainfall it's going to be a quick moving system so rainfall is going to be manageable they're\nUp at the store may slow down in the mid Atlantic states in northeast along the coast and very heavy rain possibly some inland flooding\nAnd Jerry the wind speeds could be close to hurricane force right along the coast especially up in New England and uh and it's especially on Cape Cod and of course a lot still to determine when the tracking the intensity but this'll be a pretty powerful nor'easter and it's a little early in the fall season for such a strong event\n... and let's talk about the fact that this is not an Atlantic storm a lot of the store as we talk to you about are coming out of the Atlantic this is a Pacific a hurricane that is making its way to the Atlantic but this has been an unusually active hurricane season in the Pacific\nIt has been and also now a little bit on on the unusual side of the Atlantic were pacing above normal for for numbers member this time of year\nI think if you remember Hurricane Sandy it got caught up in this this a jet stream\nAnd that happens later in the fall of the the west generally wins the mid latitude wins or a little stronger and they can sometimes dive in and\nPick up tropical entities and pushed them along member tropical systems in the in the tropics in the tropics liked to moved east to west or a right to left on the satellite images that when they get north of a certain latitude the ... winds pick them up and in this case that those ... when the Pacific pushing it all the way into New England this weekend\nAnd we're here in a late October at this point is there much time left in the hurricane season just briefly\nIt officially ends in late November but we normally see a dramatic decrease in activity around this time of year they've got to keep an eye on a couple of disturbances but things are winding down\nAnd then we can start talking to you about winter storms Jeff Hoffman director
