because there's a ... obviously have history on their side but there's so much about President Trump\nSo much motivation to get out and sent him a message and we've already started to see some numbers

case in she plans to to do that she said she was going to campaign for President Trump and twenty twenty but she's also making these statements that are very much a contradicting what the president said the president has called his political opponents evil he's called the press the enemy of the people in she's taking out a position that's\nA very different from that so she's trying to figure out

the Afghan or authority of the administration\nAnd it does come just two days before the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan do you think that it's related to that\nThe total almost strike whenever they can they have vowed to attack these polls they verge Afghan citizens like teachers and students\nNot to vote to not to put themselves up in harm's way\nThey have said that they will try very hard not to or not to injure to kill civilians but they've made it clear that they will they will attack security forces and they will attack this electoral machinery or they say this is very much in awe of intellectual exercise carried out for the west\nAnd they want to Afghanistan to have no part of it so security forces across Afghanistan are on high alert um it's hard to know when and how they will attack I remember I was here for the last to the elections in Afghanistan which for presidential elections\nAnd the Taliban had been convinced by by Pakistan or by other forces not to attack the polls but they carried out and devastating attack after the polls close we can't say for certain what will happen this time\nThis this year and now from NPR and WB you are I'm Jeremy hops and we learned today that China's economic growth is at its lowest level since the global financial crisis\nThe economy there grew six point five percent in the quarter that ended last month down from six point seven percent a year ago China stock market is down thirty percent since January and the currency the yuan is falling against the dollar\nThe country's finance officials today last state media blitz to try to shore up confidence in the economy and joining us now is NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz Hi Rob hey Jeremy says six point five percent of we'd love that kind of a growth rate in the United states in China it read news\nIt is bad news yeah six forty five percent\nWe haven't seen that uh since two thousand nine and that was when the global financial crisis hit and had a pretty tremendous impact on China and the jobs in China you know there are many many jobs lost after that and uh\nSo going back to that is not what I think China's regulators and China's bankers and China's economic planners were hoping for\nAnd so what is causing it is it mostly the terrorists from the United states\nWell China's economy has been begging for the last few years you know the government is dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble in urban China and the biggest pressure on the economy comes from this historic transition that China is making to shift\nThe way that its economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and when you're the second largest economy in the world and you're managing one point four billion people that type of economic transition is pretty painful in pretty complicated and that's part of what we're seeing here\nAnd are they expecting that it's going to last for a long time this downturn or or that there'll be able to work their way out of it somehow\nWell I think that's where the terrorists come into play because we've got in the midst of a downturn we've got these terrorists from the United states and that is happening at a pretty vulnerable time for China's so\nAh when you look at both the fact that China's economy is already lagging it's ... you know markets are tumbling and its its its currency is also starting to decline pretty quickly here\nA year and then you've got these new tariffs coming for us I think that's creating a lot of psychological bears for the Chinese and it's ah it's basically making people or try to make sure up what they've got and I think the entire system is preparing for a big shock right now\nWell you mentioned the currency ah it hit a two year low against the dollar or this week and President Trump has been accusing China keeping the currency artificially low so when uh the currency hits a two year low is that by design or is that by accident\nYeah that's an interesting question you know the economists I talked to are dismissing this idea that China's purposely weakening its currency to make its exports cheaper China used to do that but that's not really what's happening now what's happening is that the u._s. dollar is stronger than ever thanks to President Trump's tax cuts and the feds raised interest rates\nIn fact it's fair to say here that China doesn't want its currency to beat appreciating this fast because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nAnd what's interesting also is that China is manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what Trump is accused China of doing a sense of summer China's been trying to strengthen its currency so that it wouldn't weakens so fast so if China should stop manipulating its currency the UN would weaken much faster\nWhich is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between us and China NPR's Rob Schmitz joining us from Shanghai Rob thank you [noise] ... and you're
