a prominent Pakistani columnist\nAnd you're saying that ah that would be made up I only by the federal government that the federal government in other words is the only one in a position to make that kind of difference\nWell it's not only the federal government um it's also consumers one of the things we talk about is reducing consumption of red meat because cattle take an enormous amount of land that leads to deforestation both for grazing land for the cattle and for growing crops to feed\nThe cattle um if we eat less red meat we can reduce the footprints of methane and carbon dioxide related to cattle by a large amount but we're not talking about going vegetarian\nWhat we're talking about is going to the world Health Organization's dietary recommendations in the first place because most people in the west eat too much meat\nOr the more meat than it is good for them so we're really talking about consumers taking actions using more biking and walking and mass transit instead of driving their car choosing energy efficient appliances we really have to all be in this together to make it work [noise]\nI Wonder what it's like for you um is one of the authors of this report to clearly put a lot of time into it um she arrived back in the United states after the release of the report in South Korea\nAnd here really almost zero response from Washington\nWell unfortunately that's not a surprise these days um Washington is is really\nA enamored of the fossil fuel industry and that there there are many that seem to value\nThe short term profits of fossil fuel companies in automotive companies above the both short term and long term welfare of the American population you know getting rid of coal is a perfect example it sends hundreds of thousands of kids\nOr miss school because of asthma induced by pollution from coal fired power plants people die from respiratory and cardiovascular disease\nFrom coal fired power plants and we have cheaper sources of electricity so there's no reason whatsoever to keep using coal when we have better alternatives and we know that coal is extraordinarily damaging and yet the administration is moving in the exact opposite direction\nFrom what makes sense for the people writ large and instead it's what makes sense for a small group of of coal companies\nSo for a call to action for Washington for the EPA for the White House if it could do one\nThing now what would you want it to be\nIf Washington could just do one thing the thing would be to put a price\nOn pollution that really reflects the true cost and so that's the costs that comes from paying for disaster recovery after climate related disasters it's the public health burden from increased heat waves from climate from respiratory and cardiovascular disease\nAnd then we'd see that the real cost of using coal as a fuel for example is several times what the market current ... reflects\nThat it's in our best interest when taking a broad view to pay a little bit more for electricity even or vehicles that are more efficient because in the long run we come out far ahead\nThank you professor drew shin del of Duke University he's one of the authors of the United nations

question even though he told Congress that the Justice Department had asked for it\nThe White House wants to stop Ross from having to testify today a panel of judges are reviewing that request\nNPR national correspondent ... long is following this story he joins us now Hansi Hi Lisa you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question\nAnd it really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as commerce secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is and it it he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty census as soon as shortly after he became\n... the Senate confirmed him as commerce secretary so this would be a late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he worked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least what the thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the law suits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted\nResponses from a citizenship question to better and for section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially took her to make sure those groups have the right to vote 'em that the law the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the ... says that data is not enough is not accurate enough\nThis this year and now and let's turn that horrific crash in upstate New York over the weekend that killed twenty people a stretch limousine driving friends and family members to a party plowed through an intersection hit a parked vehicle and to pedestrians before winding up in a ravine and we want to take a look at limos safety with Raul our laws\nHe's vice president for the vehicle Research Center at the insurance Institute for highway safety roe welcome\nThank you for having me we're hearing now that the limo had failed and inspection last month and it really should not have even have been on the road from a safety perspective what are your first thoughts about all this\nYeah there are a many red flags here with with this crash and um of course not knowing the details and I know authorities are are looking into it but I'm certainly one of the uh the things to look for is whether this vehicle was road worthy\nAnd beyond that making sure that the driver was a licensed and and trained to drive a vehicle this big this heavy with this many people\nIt was a two thousand and one Ford Excursion that had been converted into a stretch limo essentially it had been cut in half and then made to be larger can you explain how that works\nYeah so when a Ford originally produced this vehicle uh they engineer to these things from the ground up from the time they start with their computer models to make sure that they comply with a federal safety standards\nOf one set vehicles turned over from a a manufacturer to a a vehicle model fire\nYou start cutting up a vehicle and extending it um they make these vehicles road worthy but all of those changes don't necessarily make it crush worthy and the biggest change that's taken out of these vehicles as you no longer have fold facing seats that have seatbelts proposition\nYou're also making the vehicle much larger well how did that affect the performance of it\nYeah so I'm making a vehicle that much longer a that much heavier you know you're starting off with a vehicle that's in the ... range of six to seven thousand pounds and with Eighteen occupants in it\nYou're in the ballpark of about another three thousand pounds so you're taking a vehicle now um that the same four tires and breaks need to know slow down an handle a very well a a vehicle wing you know times Thirteen thousand pounds\nA that's a lot to ask of a vehicle\nAnd you have a driver who isn't properly license to drive a vehicle of that size any is there a certain amount of training that you would need to to learn how a vehicle like that operates on the road\nAbsolutely up in the same way that we expect are a professional bus drivers to be acquainted with a large a buses on our pilots to uh know how to handle an aircraft and the routes they're going to travel up we would expect the same thing for a professional limo drivers\nAnd just briefly would you recommend people travel in a limo like this would you get into one\nI Would start by saying that limos are a very safe form of transportation or if\nYou know consumers pick a reputable company make sure that the equipment that they've hired out isn't good condition and that the driver that they've hired is is professional uh is trained and has a commercial driver's license [noise] um it is certainly a much safer

that's correct\nAnd and he does the Taliban want to govern Afghanistan again or does it simply want chaos\nThey want to show that this so that on whenever and wherever where they want to undermine the before the credibility of of on the security forces so they do these kinds of attacks\nWhat's motivating a company like Facebook to get into a space like this I mean what's their pitch to someone like you and me that says here's why you should have this\nWell I think the company pitch 'em you know for for marketing purposes is going to be\nHey we're we're Facebook rolled out connecting people connecting the world uh there's probably loved ones that you have who live in different states are different countries and there's no better way to you know stay connected than a video call right so that is the\nThat's the marketing spin that you're going to get from Facebook I think on the business side um there's this feeling that all these tech companies again our our building these devices this is probably the way that people are going to uh you know shop someday um they're going to watch television they're going to basically run their daily life around the house\nBy using these devices and these assistance and I think Facebook is you know probably terrified about being left out of that conversation and watching Amazon apple and Google dominate the market so I think from a business standpoint if you look long term I kind of owning a place inside people's homes I think that's a pretty valuable place for Facebook to try and be\nAnd let's look let's bring in the elephant in his room just about two weeks ago we had the latest privacy scandal fifty million Facebook accounts were hacked due to problems in Facebook's code of course there was the Cambridge Analytica story from earlier this year\nWhy should people trust Facebook inside their home I mean it's very intimate moments potentially\nVery and the idea of not just having a microphone in there but also a camera right something that uh you know could theoretically if it gets turned on at the wrong time unexpectedly it's all it's all of a sudden recording your house and not just an audio but with video\nI'm I think that's the ultimate question and that's the question I basically posed when I wrote about the device on Monday was\nIs there a good reason to trust Facebook at this point and I think\nUh you know I I don't think the people there are malicious but at the same time there have been so many blunders in the last twelve months\nThat there's people are going to have to ask themselves is the benefit of having this device a worth the risk of a potentially you know having some type of security issue or privacy issue\nI think that a lot of people are going to be turned off by the fact that this is coming from Facebook especially right now um but there are a lot of people as we learned that just you know don't necessarily care as much about privacy as you might think\nIn baseball talked about this uh I I've been taking precautions to help make people feel better\nOh for sure I mean you would think that since a role in this out now that might be a little um you know blind to the fact that the timing isn't so great\nUm but they they were in in interviews I did with them they were very uh self aware I suppose of the fact that this probably doesn't look good to a lot of people so there are privacy things do ten for example it is not\nGoing to uh you know listen to your voice I'm ... and kind of acknowledge what you're saying in the last few awaken the device by a kind of saying hey portal that's kind of the key word to to let it no you should start listening to you um it's not going to record you unless you know you actively are on a video call and even then sorry it's not even a recording that's just\nThe cameras on so there are different safety elements that they clearly put in to try and avoid an issue like this but again I'm you know do you trust Facebook to to do that the right way and there's a lot of people who are going to say now\nIt's just one hack away from having all those safety precautions sort of vanish um which you know just makes me think what's at stake for Facebook if they messed this up\nWell what's interesting is that um there have been some kind of privacy issues with Amazon's device for example a you know maybe a recording things that people didn't know was recording all that kind of stuff\nBut I think the big difference between like Amazon and Facebook is that Amazon does not position itself as this kind of place where you build your personal connections and where you store your personal memories\nIt it's more of a utility it's like the place that you use to shop Facebook on the other hand has has really built an entire brand around\nYou know connecting you to the people you love being in the place for your baby photos and your private messages so when Facebook screws up it feels more intimate then I think it does when when uh Amazon or an apple screws up\nAren't Wagner senior editor of social media at Recode thank you thank you [noise] and here now is the production of NPR and WVU are in association with the
