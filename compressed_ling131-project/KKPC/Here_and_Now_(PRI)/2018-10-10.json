investigate what was the ... but do we want it to investigate it for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a moral crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up\nTo the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began so after\nEunice was hired a she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these much come in and they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attacks you actually put together the first evidence anyone had ever had the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set ourselves a task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded Dewey to a range of police raids which Eunice was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women\nWere accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out than it was to keep the women and they would turn against the fixers than to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses will turn against their bosses have helped to only turn against I'm Lucy I don't know ... everyone's surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana\nWere prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with was a woman known as Cokie flow brown researchers noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit\nOr when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Louisiana several times discussing that the prostitution business with his aides [noise]\nShe was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times let me interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that his Lucy on his lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony\nSo cookie flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team in Louisiana team had no women so she was there when the doctors examine term returned to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise]\nSo how does learning this story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America the Nineteen thirties\nOne to take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to America now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people as they go into stores it talks about employment discrimination all the sorts of things that people talked about today but it is\nTime I think part of our forgotten history is that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for

in ... Colorado\nSunrise let's step back and ask some big picture questions here uh we know that this is an arid state overall we know that in the face of climate change a droughts are likely to get worse uh are farmers\nQuestioning what they grow here are they looking more broadly at the question of climate change and whether the the state they find themselves in with precipitation right now is just a a new permanent state of affairs\nClimate change in a mini farm is just a farmer's way of life and uh the climate is never the same any two years in a row it varies farmers farm within the norm of what they considered it a norm\nIs is that norm shift shift a shift stored less precipitation over a longer period of time\nThey will shift with it they're used to shifting I mean they constantly\nPlay for the average uh far as weather goes that's typically what they're used to doing so consequently although we're seeing climate change they will leave all they will grow to different crops maybe they'll move from on dry land particularly I moved from drowning corn grain sorghum cars a little less moisture\nMaybe they'll plant different varieties of wheat that require a little less moisture they will evolve with that uh that spin a way of life\nFor agriculture ever since it first existed\nAre their highlights is is there some promise right now in agriculture in Colorado\nOh I think there's always promise and uh you know I'm we're talking pretty doom and gloom here but I always say there's opportunities one can shift their business models slightly a marketing maybe doing a little better job of marketing digging a operated take an opportunity to markets running to maybe a\nForward contracts them commodities uh no I'm I'm not a doom and gloom guy at all I'm an optimist you have to be when you put a little bitty seat in the ground and expect it to generate a lot more seed then you put in I mean so you you've you know I I don't think that the doom and gloom some way to be it's a reality of the moment\nThis too shall pass but uh you have to get to that moment to get to the future thanks for being with us pleasure being here and I really appreciate it thank you so much\nDon brown Colorado's agriculture commissioner he spoke to us from his farm in ... Colorado about the stresses and some of the possibilities that farmers face in the state right now\nWhen we come back chili versus Chile Colorado matters from CPR news\nThere's more rain and lights no possible around Denver through this evening\nThings will start to clear up tomorrow and by friday it's sunny and warm today near forty around Denver and getting back near sixty for the end of the week same in the springs rain snow and fog and highest near forty\nIt's getting warmer around Grand Junction with high in the fifties for the rest of the week and the chance for rain through tomorrow and more snow in the mountains in temperatures staying in the thirties today around ... getting not quite as cold on Thursday\nSupport comes from the vineyard wine shop a destination for fine wine in cherry creek north since Nineteen Seventy one between wine of the month clubs educational and start tasting and a curated collection and why\nIn Colorado they've probably been grown for let's say about a hundred years but in terms of promotion New Mexico has that advantage going back decades that hatched growers they've been promoting their chilies and hatched jeeze going back to Nineteen Seventy and they really finally hit the mainstream outside of the American south west\nMaybe about Fifteen Years ago in Colorado and the story I did for NPR's assault their food blog or the ... the what what do they call themselves apply blow chili grows associations in other words the group of\nFarmers in Pueblo that got together to promote their chili they only got together and twenty Fifteen that's only three years ago so even though the chilies been grown in southern Colorado ... century the farmers finally realize like oh wow maybe\nYeah maybe this thing can hit outside of southern Colorado are okay\nSo it's a question of perhaps time an investment is it a question at all of industrialization like I Wonder if the processes are different and New Mexico that allow you know for that much larger coal\nAgain I mean and it's funny ah you had the agricultural commission on rights commissioner on right before me I'm going to be able\nTo answer that question better but I mean from what I Know and talking to farmers in Colorado are you know the chili farmers in southern Colorado it was just never\nA thing and what I mean by a thing was that the people down in southern ... Colorado they knew about the ... so they would only go growth for the people who knew it never had any ambition of trying to grow for market outside of southern Colorado\nNow and in a part of it was just it made us all itself was bread it was a very delicate fragile chili\nTo mediate climate change is that it will be an economic hardship\nAh that you are hitting industries oil and gas among them that many people in Colorado are connected to uh negatively uh and that the economy's might in fact shrink so to say just a bit more what you mean when you say this can be profitable\n\nXcel Energy recently lost by about a year ago put out on all sources solicitation for who could supply them electricity at what price from any source\nThey got no bid for fossil sources of new power less than four cents a kilowatt hour Wendell is a little a little under two cents solar was a little over two cents limited plus solar plus storage batteries was three cents\nActually let a seal that natural gas would be the winner\nOur governor has been positioning the state to be a natural gas state\nThey were gobs smacked renewable energy is cheaper than fossil energy and so when citizens put solar on their homes their electricity bills go down I have a solar on my ranch in twenty thirty\nThe floods happened in power was out for the better part of a week not at my house I called my neighbors said you want to come charge your cell phones are put stuff in the freezer\nIt is more secure it builds community and there are now more jobs in Colorado from renewable energy clean energy energy efficiency than from all of the extractive industries oil gas coal uranium those jobs are declining\nFracking the uh people are saying oh don't vote for a proposition on twelve it'll cut jobs those jobs are dying anyway that industry is badly in debt over leverage and we'll go away\nWhy I wouldn't hang up all economy we should be investing in what will solve climate change and again it's cheaper once you put up the wind and solar it's free the fuel is free what part of free don't you understand\nYou say it's cheaper how much of that is because of subsidies\nAll in all energy is subsidized\nGlobally we spend five trillion dollars actually I Believe it's five point three\nEvery year subsidizing fossil energy that's ten billion dollars in it\nAnd that comes out of your and my tax dollars for citizens around the world all of the renewable subsidies put together are far less than what we continue to subsidize to fossil energy so I'm a free market tear let's get rid of all subsidies\nLet all these technologies compete on their merits and you will not hear the oil and gas boys saying that because they cannot exist without those subsidies\nA hunter lemons of the Colorado carbon fund and natural capital solutions what is carbon farming help us understand that as a potential way of uh I guess it sequestering carbon\n[noise] it is when you farm or ranch regenerative lovely using what's called holistic management you're taking carbon out of the air and putting it back in the soil one of the best examples and if you want a good video on this\n... brown keys to building a healthy soil gave was a North Dakota corn and soybean farmer struggling because he was struggling he went first to know till he stopped breaking the soil gun you break the soil turned it upside down\nThe carbon escapes he then went to planting cover crops many of them deep rooted\nThat takes carbon deep into the soil he'd been introduced animals cattle goats sheep pigs\nThe animal impact the disturbance on the ground for a short period of time to eat everything and then you move them to a new pasture using electric fences\nThat\nAction is what put the ten feet of thick black soil that the pioneers found when they came across the great plains it put that black which is carbon deep into the soil\nDeb has gone on some of his tactics from a little over one percent soil organic matter carbon so now I'm some of them over eleven percent\nNative prairie soil is seven percent Gabe is rolling climate change backward and he's gone from a struggling commodity operation to now a very profitable\nFarming ranching operation\nSelling a variety of crops products\nThis is being done in Colorado right in Boulder is the savory Institute which is the center of how you do regenerative agriculture regenerative grazing\nYou can go on the savory Institute website and find reams of evidence all the scientific studies showing that we can roll climate\nChange backward ... literally have carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the ground to help I realize that's probably a naive question but help help listeners understand just briefly does the science of that or is it simply that you are not releasing carbon that would otherwise be released\nNo it says you said it to begin with your taking carbon out of the air it's called photosynthesis brass has forty times the carbon per weight of a tree\nThe world's grasslands are the world's second largest carbon sink carbon stored on storage after the oceans and yet we've been ... grasslands we can read carbon eyes them by grazing the way that grasslands co evolved with grazing animals\nOn the great plains herds of ... pack because there were rules if a wolf wants to eat you the safe place to be in the middle of the herd so they're all trying to get to the middle there plump up they eat everything and then they move on\nMeanwhile they fertilize the ground their hooves of chop it up they don't come back until the grass has read grown\nBut that action of fertilizing it of impacting the grass drives carbon deep into the biological community and the soil particularly the Michael rise or fun guy and I know this is sounding a bit ...\nWill know again I\nGo to the gate brown video and ... through exactly what he did\nAnd why it's making him now wildly profitable\nThere are thousands of\nRegenerative farmers all over the United states now around the world savory Institute has regenerative hubs I Am right now at the alliance center in Denver working with a team of people that are building a regenerative economic hub for the Denver Boulder area\nAnd you can go on the natural capitalism website not\nKept solutions dot org\nAnd get information on what we're doing if\nYou want to

Haynes joins me from Colorado State university where he's now a freshman high Malecon\nFor how's it going to grab me yeah it's going well and congratulations this is a huge national award from the boys and girls clubs of America I'm I'm curious about your relationship with that organization I think it dates back to when you were six on first joined it what what attracted you\nFirst what am I fix birthday I'm Glad I was going through how to after school program up on the show with the was it goes so established and that wasn't going to walk to school and the kids back to the boy that goes with every day so my friends are going there on the school of law and there's I just figured if I go to try to you\nAnd what kept you going\nOh I'd probably say as a young kid just the opportunities that by there and try new things where there is playing sports are doing educational games or just get a new a new friend oh it was a place that I felt welcome there\nLater stand that early on your mom came to pick you up and had a hard time even\nFinding you what were you were you doing\nYeah this is my first day there Tom she came to pick me up and we actually paying us staff versus kids basketball game and I was a small person that wasn't goes up and my fix birthday [noise]\nUm so I was only ... left in the game and so I happen to hit the last staff member there to win the game for the kids now the kids came running onto the basketball court replaying dos ball and I found out what might have been calling me to the ... for about ten Fifteen minutes to see what the too happy with\nThat [laughter] but it must have been very nice day for you I fast forward quite a few years and you won this award largely for setting up a reading program for the younger kids in the club or we heard just a little bit about it in the introduction how did it work\n[noise] uh well I actually started because I was in the program in my high school so we have to do community service project so I figured what better way than to arrest them some there every day I'm somebody when my friends that I Know a few get we found five kids\nWho are really reading at least to do was below the crane grade level on which is kind of surprising to me so we just figured that we're going to go in there we're going to be with them for four hours um every Friday\nThey are going to come to the best students and that did not work so we figured that we had to ask the kids but they need it from us to help them out so whether that included pizza or playing football with him and playing basketball with them\nI was just developing those relationships to get them to want to read with us ah it was a really worked for us with\nPizza that sounds like you're bribing them to read I suppose there are worse things yeah bright kids for a this is called double trouble reading program\nYes what did you call a double trouble\nAlso at first it wasn't called double trouble but then we started playing basketball or football with the kids read read with them for what our and then play and they eat pizza for another hour or so we've got the name from that was shovel\nOkay so the national award makes you the use of the year for the boys and girls clubs of America you get a twenty five thousand dollars scholarship to renewable for four years and I I have to think that this award is based partly on the results of the reading program to to make a difference\nUm I Would like to think so just because all those kids were in the reading program came in reading at a second grade reading level there in the fifth grade and then each one of the improved by one at least one where you live within the six week period\nThough and that scholarship that's going to get you through the su\nI guess I'm going to see is he right now it's going to give me through college um debt free\nThanks for being with us Malecon from ...

live from NPR News in Washington Ken I'm Laurie London hurricane Michael is closing in on the Florida Panhandle as a dangerous and life threatening\nOr I'm NPR's Debbie Elliott reports Michael has strengthened kill a category for hurricane with one hundred and fifty mile per hour winds\nMichael is making history as the strongest hurricane to hit the northern Gulf Coast Florida governor Rick Scott says expect unimaginable devastation\nHurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in a century\nFEMA director Brock Long calls it the worst kind of hurricane combining damaging winds heavy rain and a storm surge that could reach fourteen feet\nThose you stick around to experience storm surge do typically lived to tell about it unfortunately\nAs it moves inland hurricane Michael is also going to impact parts of southeast Alabama Georgia and the Carolinas Debbie Elliott NPR News quest to Florida\nPresident Trump has been

weaken or overturn roe the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide Planned Parenthood's Don McGahn says abortion rights advocates expected increasingly difficult environment\nAlready women across this country have to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing they have to access support\nFor ... for a Andrew Gillum he's kinda got the same situation as Governor Scott he's got the ability to really show people his leadership\nShow people the way he's going to manage a crisis and in a very intimate real way people will see him being a leader in the course of this race this is something that the the dynamic of Florida is very interesting because even Democrats who I talked to in this state say you know senator Nelson as having some trouble he's an insider Scott is kind of trying to take them on\nAnd sending Olson is not really doing the same kind of campaign work to go out and get the new Democrats Andrew Gillum as is bringing into the race and try to appeal to them I think the ... campaign thinks those Democrats who vote for him automatically the people in the ground say not so fast you got to go get\nSo the both the Scott and the Gillum campaigns have the opportunity to really show their muscle during the storm\nIt's funny because there's so many other issues that these people have been campaigning on all along and now this storm could really change the dynamics of the race house\nCertainly and and Governor Scott when he ran for governor in twenty ten when I worked for him his uh he had three priority is it is jobs jobs and jobs and he said that once he said it a thousand times and\nAnd that is what he's been able to provide for the people of Florida and and has a good record on that but also what he is as done speaking of natural disasters the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico a lot of those residents did come into Florida and our\nWhether they're taking up residency or they're spending time there Governor Scott has done a tremendous job of\nMaking them a welcome providing the resources that they need and that will go a long way to\nTo not just providing for the people there but the Hispanic community that is so critical to that vote in the Senate race so so his ability to to provide for people everyday citizens of Florida but also stepping up to the plate not just with compassion about what the resources necessary in a natural disaster\nGoes I I wanted to show what kind of leader with\nThe Crossley ID Guide would have been me has one more thing to say which is about the the path of the storm I'm probably more hurtful to the ... campaign just because there was a more Republican parts of the state\nThat are going to be impacted and those people are those citizens are going to be very preoccupied by that I'm also hearing which is very tough the Sanders campaign loss of negative ads today on the Gillum campaign which just seems to me it would be very toned up to go after your political opponents with new advertising while so many residents\nHave their uh have their lives hanging in the balance\nOkay just in the minute that we have left here sorry Alice let me just get to one other thing because it's it's important to which is a Mitch McConnell is calling the people who have been protesting about cabinet or a an angry mob\nAnd it it brings us back to the Tea Party which came to power after doing the same kinds of things at town hall meetings in twenty ten during the debate over Obamacare a ... is it the same thing\nOh I Do think it is the same thing and not only that McConnell called of the attacks on a judge Kavanaugh as coming from a mob when they were just people standing outside you know voicing their opinions and and being arrested in people protest\nBut the people inside of a of a political rally shouting lock her up to a political opponent of what the president United States mild reaction of that's not a mob\nLet me just say this to tea partiers never went into Iraq private restaurants and chase senators out of out of restaurants while they're on their private time and what we're seeing these protesters and the Kavanaugh situation\nChasing out Senator Cruz banging on the doors at the Supreme Court and and chasing centers down the hall that is not black mentality okay gotta leave it there Alistair ... thank

American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community and foreign born ... according to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim his principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James ... the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican and ... seconds interests are friends are more on the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why be what Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption the government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nLot of this current Americans that grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas into focus more progressive thinking than more the conservative the suburban ideal\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nIn the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so\nAnd the question the workforce and how\nA lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration system so it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nThat's what I was able to uh get my ... good so I mean is that how old you have to be sixteen to fly blurb for for private pilots ticket\nYou can be a student pilot prior to that and actually my son Bobby was the youngest person in the world to solo in a hot air balloon at age nine but he did it in an ultralight balloons so there's no pilots to ... or ... age requirements for an ultralight\nSo it's a family affair savannah what about you do you always know you wanted to join in the family business\nUh no actually uh when I was little I had no desire to become a pilot and I was just happy being a proud member of the ground crew and just helping out wherever I could but something clicked when I was Thirteen and I just kind of decided you know what like I'm going to start\nMy training and I so load on my fourteenth birthday and got my license on my sixteenth birthday\nWhile one of the things I Love about the Albuquerque fiesta is the pictures of all those balloons just hanging in the air there so colorful they're beautiful what's your balloon look like this year\n[noise] ah the balloon that I'm flying actually is a a beautiful blue in with a orange red and yellow colors and it has the as the assemble which is the state's symbol for a for a New Mexico or on the equator on two sides\nSo I'd definitely stands out it's pasteurized balloon so I'm Carrying twelve passengers every morning with me and this is my fortieth a fiesta that I've attended I've I'm thirty seven of them and I'm Still in all every single time it's a beautiful sight out\nThere it is ... what's your ...\nAh my balloon is black on the bottom with a rainbow the rainbow colors coming down from the top and it's I Believe in that holds or about a four people and it's amazing and this is my third year in fiesta but I've seen it every year my life and I love it\nSavannah we heard how your dad is this experience sort of celebrated pilot what's it like to have him as your guide is he given you tips for flying over the years\nI'm definitely I actually funny enough I didn't want to learn how to fly from my dad 'cause as great as he is he's my dad didn't want him telling\nYou what to do your homework fire balloon\n[laughter] yeah so I had a different instructor but now especially as I'm becoming a more experienced pilot he's been a very very great mentor and helped me to work towards the things I Want to accomplish\nRight I'm sure you're very comfortable up there in the sky but do you worry about your daughter up in a balloon\nOf course because it's so my daughter so as as accomplished as she is and I know how good of a pilot she is um I still require after every Wyoming to give me a call and let me know that she's down in safe show yeah I'm Still bad for sure what what are the risks up there so high and this guy\nThe risks are nominal um provided that you're a really uh you know paying attention it's like any other form of aviation um the number of accidents that happen are very rare and then it's infrequent however when they do or they can have some dire consequences so um the the real risk that are out there\nAnd are mitigated by you know good calls on on the field before you ever take off so it's really a pilot judgment and making sure that the pilots picking a good day to fly well\nThere are some changes to the fiesta this year one drone\nWill be allowed to fly with the balloons to take pictures and there have been some concerns or by local pilots maybe you're one of them about not having enough places to land because the area around Albuquerque is becoming more developed what about that if you notice any big changes to your sport\nOh the the Albuquerque areas definitely changed dramatically like um when I started flying the entire north part of Albuquerque was not built up into anything is still open fields\nAnd now we're really truly flying into congested area every single flight so um but the city of Albuquerque is very very balloons friendly so the city itself designates that basically any school park golf course anything this city owned is open and and welcoming to ...\n[noise] that's Troy Bradley and his daughter savannah who are hot air

B. U. R. I'm Peter O'Dowd this is here and now\nThe vaccine for human papillomavirus or HPV PV has been approved for men and women between the ages of twenty seven and forty five that's expanded from the previous recommendations that included only kid and young adults between nine and twenty six\nThe H. P. B. a virus causes cervical cancers in women peanut oil and neck cancers in men but the vaccine has been shown to be eighty eight percent effective Dr Jessica shepherd practices obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor University in Dallas doctor shepherd welcome\nThank you so much thank you for having\nSure you did the FDA make the right choice to expand the age range of this vaccine\nOh absolutely I think that that choice was a very much a desire especially from you know health providers\nAnd just from you know the health industry seeing that the amount of cancers that are age ... the address and have been increasing it definitely allows more people to be covered and really it doesn't limit people to you know the age of twenty cents which has previously when it stopped\nWorrying that eighty million Americans are infected with some form of each PV and the fourteen million new people contract it every year so why was it ever limited to just kids and young adults in the first place\nSo looking at studies especially when you're submitting to the FDA for approval\nFor a new medication or a drive there's really there has to be an end point and so initially when they're looking reproductive age and the risk of cervical cancers eleven through Thirteen is when they started to try and capture\nAdolescence before there is any sexual intercourse or activity from gay crease in the risk of contracting that virus and so now what we've seen over the years is that\nThey will have increase in in broad range of age in order to get us out more people the vaccine because they have such good outcome\nNow if you're between twenty seven and forty five you're more likely to be in a monogamous relationship so who in that group um do you recommend should get that vaccine\nAnd that's the perception is that you know people are more likely to be in a monogamous relationship not always true but the thing about H. P. V. is that can be contracted very early and again the symptoms of it or not typically what you would see with a virus so many people don't\nKnow that they're carrying the virus\nAnd so it can be transmitted to any partner at any time in life and so if you have the ability for again people outside of that age range now that they're capturing after the age of twenty six up to the age of forty five and that's great because\nThe transmission of the virus can be decreased significantly just able to protect more people and also\nDecrease the amount of H. P. B. cancers cars that actually the risk of H. P.
