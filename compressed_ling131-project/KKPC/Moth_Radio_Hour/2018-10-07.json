own experience but then as I developed in the field of women's health and beginning to understand\nThat there were these profound sex differences across organ systems and in psychiatric disease as well and to better understand what happened then and how we actually change the path forward\nOne of my earliest seminars that I took as an undergraduate at Harvard was with a professor at Emory Hubbard and she was the first ten year old woman in the biology department at Harvard\nShe was a renowned feminist and had work to develop a field that focused on looking at biology through a feminist

to the hospital\nSo as a child they used to run and hide in plain hospital and in our home family my both siblings and my father had to see the asthma\nSo I have seen and learn new med scene so early as age of ten I knew what injection means and everything to me it was a little bit boring\nAnd it's like now I Wonder if the story and I love history I used to listen old grandmother who come into the house and\nMy mom's like no you didn't have a choice I built the hospital for you so my journey was chosen by my mother and I resisted when I was very young but one civil war had been and as age of Fifteen when I deliver first child\nAnd decided to where I have to be you know this is where my energy is more important than anywhere else so my delivery and my first child that made me\nTo accept my mother's plan [laughter] well do you need to live with your ... Fifteen\nFifteen I have no idea in midstream background anything I had to watch this woman was my mom was doing this surgery and I'm running to them and saying that she is about to deliver and they

come across any of these IDs and your medical training will sex differences in terms of how we diagnose and treat patients because he will change in Russia is that correct definitely\nFor us as my mother's work and my work is just putting the woman's house first\nIt's not the scientific level is just to give him axis and being first and instead of coal come to a nation taking care of the only children and emergency but no one is thinking about the woman so that's where we were thinking about it and as a woman has to have access to health care the basic healthcare cleaned delivery\nAnd knowing about Dr Jackson's work it just makes more fascinating yes that's what people are supposed to focus that's what the research should be\nPointed when you were a practicing cardiologist how do you think your agenda in since you approach to work\nAs a woman I think that women look at you for sure with a certain level of trust and you as a woman also understand the context of women's lives so approaching women holistically that as such at the center of women's health\nIt's the intersection of the biology with what their social and environmental context in which they live\nAs well as somebody the other factors that impact their lives like the legal structure and I think being a woman\nYou've lived that life and you think have a more natural affinity not that it can't be taught it can be taught but I Do think you were starting in a different place\nAnd you've had stomach ache or when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make you were women\nIt's huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you and discuss into sexual issues there Ninety eight percent of some other woman went to the F G and female genital mutilation so their challenges their difficulties they faced in you know\nAlso their rights biggest challenge you face in a position in Somalia is woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any fish teacher I have to wait or has been a brother or someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you to your body you know you can do it it's just different activities more if we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask\nWhat was your big but I usually asked my patients do they have you eaten unit because she sometimes forget herself she has ten kids\nShe had been even eaten you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than ...\nCould you take it into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to I think that\nI think for my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely a leading in flood level was very extremely they know in the condition and somebody we don't have blood bank\nSo we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact you need that\nThe blood and and draw divide so we struggled after you know six seven hours looking at ... and ... and she's got to go out a number of ... you cannot have the children you have to wait you have to do this given all this\nPatient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet and I was so you guys you know starting breaching hairy you know you want to die you ought to do this\nAnd by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just got my second husband if I don't give him\nA child he will just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from is not only being in a finishing who or training to what that transformed my clinical skill and approach\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you face take all the first one to ask you point out about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for a non because most treatments were designed for men not women might inside\nWell science has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials but the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at\nThe animals we use in research they are far more frequently
