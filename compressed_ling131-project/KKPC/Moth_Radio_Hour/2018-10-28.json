I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with them and how collaborative the oddest wants to date I always approach every project openly and seeing that each time it said hold different experience because I'm always like kind of different people\nOkay we can get very some authors to his but you've worked with a lost his email on this is my choice will buy Jones yes\nIn some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but the results or the fact that you can often be potentially I Would say ... ... pigeonholed based on your previous work so safe you out a lot of success with women so the oddest it's very likely you'll get a lot of those trucks which has been my experience for\nYou tend to work with them at the beginning of their careers when they still trying to stop dish ... who they are going to be in some ways yeah yeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent me a lot to me when I look at the spread of office you've worked with they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and ...\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for a meet people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to fuse women in the videos from a place of strength\nOr public political strong story\nTelling well I Want to get into that little bit more because one of the most effective ways of promoting music eighth via sex you know when the video naked album cover some ways to selling a product\nBut give me ... posts nitty drew the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an office and you know the exploitation\nOh look it depends on what I'm inspired by\nHighlights flooded with the idea of the family and body\nAnd facts of course but it's from a different place from it takes place is from a place of sensuality each there's a section is\nA woman hold when she is powerful in ... sensuality I Do explored but is it tastes well yeah I think a lot of the quote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if that's what inspired by that is why my mom you might be gratuitous to some places I'm never going to switch as when I Am\nPutting a concept together the few things I'm looking at does this promote the art is what are you trying to say I never think in a way where I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini age\nAnd you have someone wrote dollars that are out if I'm going to do that you have to be for appeal at the end that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nBecause I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician with kid on the song is called tease me and said to the gentleman's club\nYou went to a gentleman and the woman\nDancing but I think in the hands of a different direction that video 'cause I didn't really see any absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nI think that is actually the most raunchy videos ever done when he came out it was it was a big deal because prior to that we get those kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but just to be but clean caught in that video was one of the things that broke him into that that the mobile kind of thinking\nAnd I knew he had a little bit nervous about it you're sending Twenty one I seen at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it's just these women and it's not done this but it it's not like you said if he wasn't that hands on maybe somebody else\nIt will not having tastefully done if you go from the costumes that they were wearing ... they had the march on doing something very central about the ...\nThey have the power and he was the one actually that was overwhelmed\nThe wasn't anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is as you probably want to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now after that you know if\nThere was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of\nThose famous video is is that if the American sing a Katy Perry you know the song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production we're always on the video for ... and by then we can sing or how would you say your work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is all for two very very different artists inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with or not is no doubt you're putting your on Pakistan on a project is just no way to not do that because\nEverything you do is walk and intuition and you're making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of kindergartners flavor to project however I always really tried to not\nLet that person will stop or to take\nAn artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more [laughter] thing is that you\nDidn't want to put your personal something to that that's what I noticed there were just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that isn't\nKing is a product you know and and and it's it's funny because I was a real fashion about five years ago where all these ... started putting their names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was not really\nThe best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about and that this is an estimate for the artist if anything suit\nKing would you say that the common theme is about how women one to come across in these videos about you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival ...\nThen what is it about you know well so you walk away and you listen to the ... Steve how are you in ... because sometimes they really are ... I don't always have to\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny at least to me through how you go from page to final productive what are your techniques\nSo you know they gave me this song I go back I could listen to a song and meeting at the snatch is of pictures in my head like I just like steel frame and then I just have to reduce the gather\nAnd sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know the the phone when I'm brushing my team I got a point when I'm cooking when I'm drinking from why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she would\nCome to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm sleeping with a pen I just get up and I write it all down because I Know I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and hundreds if another hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] a hundred percent I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that that's what it is I shouldn't have been talking about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point in the liberal talked to has come in and in my career because of\nPresident of course it gets to the point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do and trust that this is what we need to do I because I'll be quick deposit I'm a business person\nSecond to last me crazy person but we're not pitching arm cutting that idea very passionate about it I can I can teach that I can feel it I Do everything from\nThe when you look the dress you're going to win the ... the entire vision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know maybe you can get 'em\nKimmy talks about repeat to listening so the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth and she's drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that are definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening practice until you just can't ... you know I almost I guess yeah if you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem it sometimes you get a truck and I like to make it as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "28"}
