country but I actually think that that by itself is not going to turn on the trip because this is something I think that really needs leadership I I agree with the ambassador that the\nThe blame has not been symmetrical I mean we have a president who instead of trying to actually unite the country around some common interests has done everything in town or to try to increase the degree of polarization\nBut in a certain sense that means that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is the result of\nThis kind of what I Would regard as really bad leadership it means that

precipice of ...\nSo if they were for pets will have a minute left So Professor ... if that leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and I think that if you're you know I really do think the upcoming election in November as one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have of holding their leaders accountable\nAnd there's going to be big implications drawn depending on the way that this election and
