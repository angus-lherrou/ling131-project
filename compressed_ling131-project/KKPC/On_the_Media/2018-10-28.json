conference earlier today\nBowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people after a standoff with police powers eventually surrendered and remains in federal custody today\nAnd we just and that that was talked a lot about his anti Semitic views before the attack on a social media platform called gab and we understand has become popular with some far right conservative that's all right activist what did he say they're\nYeah his writings reflect really hardcore anti Semitism vicious hatred and a lot of it echoing conspiracy theories Michelle about Jewish

weapon with a very high rate of fire as well as three ... three fifty seven hand guns\nAs already said today he used all of those weapons during the attack and it appears so far that he acquired the

does he face\nTotal of twenty nine federal charges so far including a murdering victims were exercising religious beliefs are and also harming police officers at the press conference today they were
