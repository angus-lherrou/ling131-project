writer she's a columnist with the Philadelphia Inquirer Maria thanks so much for talking with us thank you so much for having me\n[noise]\nNow another story and our troll watch theory [noise]\nFor this program we've been trying to keep track of the ways that Internet trolls especially those directed by foreign governments have been trying to influence American voters by pushing fake stories are hyping up stores with a partisan or mean spirited edge\nNow we've heard about an army veteran who's trying to eliminate this information on Facebook that targets service members and veterans he's flag about one hundred Facebook pages that millions of ...\nAnd he's with us now Chris Goldsmith is the assistant director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam veterans of America\nAnd he's also founder and president of high ground veterans advocacy and he's with us from NPR's bureau in New York critical for thanks so much for talking to us hey thanks for having me so let me let me ask you to walk me through this now this started because you were trying to understand how well you are\nLegitimate Facebook pages were doing and then you realize that somebody had what stolen your logo and it was pushing content with it and had more followers than you tell me about that correct yes so\nI was just helping my communications team manage our social media pages and um I typed in Vietnam veterans of America and one day I noticed that there was another page that came up before hours and it had an even larger following\nSo I investigated the page found out that they had been using our logo pretending to be us but they were sending everyone to a European\nWebsite the vets dot edu but that was the first red flag where it's you know these people are just trying to sell T shirts or something they're creating an entire environment to support the fake Facebook pages\nYeah tell me about that what kinds of things where they using their page to say\nSo most of the stuff that this particular group of trolls was pushing a we eventually located them in in Bulgaria one particular incident was there was a legitimate news story in rural Massachusetts there was\nA Vietnam veterans monument that had been defaced some kid took some berries and rubbed on it but what they did was they took that local news story in loops the fifty second video for four hours as Facebook Live video\nAnd over that they put a phrase that said do you think the criminals must suffer and encourage people to respond\nNow it was based in truth but it was made to look more urgent and it looked like it was happening live this wasn't just you know one person in Bulgaria you know trying to build a following\nThis was a conspiracy what I'm basically doing is is leaving a trail of bread crumbs so that Facebook's threat intelligence team can take the actual experts to analyze the data I've found\nSo that they can get more information about who's behind it\nWhat is it do you think is attracting people as it is it because they could combine it with this kind of deep patriotic sentimental what's the appeal\nSo the reason why they are going to the right is because that's the type of content that the extreme right is producing organically so it blends in their goal is to blend in with\nAnd amplify the extremes in this country\nThat the ultimate goal here is is not veterans is to make the United states in a permanent condition of paralysis they want for us to not be able to function as a democracy and the way that they do that is they sabotage any\nIdea of bipartisanship not just for our elected members of Congress but for the electric and we as a society need to start educating ourselves\nOn the issue of cyber hygiene we need to understand that it's it's very important to everything that we share we need to make sure that the source is reliable\nAnd when it comes to politics we need to make sure that it's generated from inside the United states\nThat was Chris

subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and\nWho've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party and he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd ... with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie bossy four testified about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot\nYou know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar I get something that I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this was where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right yeah\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like he was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling\nAnd then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled on his than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other parts of the party started touching another young woman\nMy only theory is that\nHe wasn't used to being told he couldn't do something at the end the court testimony it came out there and he had impregnated in another woman at one point and had threatened her and kind of pressured her to get an abortion and that one and she did and that worked out and then he had had this other son of four or five years\nBefore and then ... Adams was absolutely adamant that she was going to have this baby I do not think he enjoyed being told no at any point in his life and so that's the only I I guess you know there's far more to it certainly been just that but I think\nThat's part of it is that you know athletes have to learn but no means no just like the rest of us need to learn it and it's a it's a lesson that I think a pro sports is trying to teach but still has a long way to go\nThat Scott Fowler the Charlotte Observer he's produced a seven part pod cast and sprinted series called curve Ruth about re route who is released\nFrom prison tomorrow Scott balanced thanks for joining\nThank you so much [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's been more than a month since natural gas fires and explosions ruptured across three communities just north of Boston thousands of homes there still don't have heat and now things are starting to get chilly in New England Craig lemoult of member station WBUR GBH has the story of families they're bracing for\nColder temperatures on that September evening Kelsey grinding in Tim Kurdish noticed the smell of natural gas in their Lawrence apartment\nAnd then we actually felt the explosion from the house I Believe on Jefferson straight\nAbout eighty homes and the three neighboring communities Lawrence Andover in North Andover were on fire several houses blew up including one explosion that killed a teenager I mean it was a it was scary thousands of homes were evacuated including bears and they stayed with family for a few days\nBut they're back home now with their one and a half year old Ricky who titles around holding a rubber duck\nGrounded worked at a pizza shop down the street but it's out of work because it's been closed since the natural gas shut off more than a month ago and they don't have any seat at home\nAnd it's been cold and then here I mean we're in a basement apartment so naturally the concrete is going to be called just what that alone [noise]\nA small space heater sits in the middle of the floor Ricky keeps toddling towards\nHot don't tend to think since the incident futility\nColumbia gas has been working to replace forty four miles of old pipeline there also busy replacing thousands of damaged furnaces water heaters and home appliances and they say they're on track to meet their target restoring old service by November nineteenth Curtis doesn't trust that'll happen and says he just doesn't know when they'll have heat\nNo no idea I don't even know how this happened you know\nThat's under investigation a preliminary report faulted Columbia gas for not taking proper safety measures to prevent the disaster as it gets colder utilities putting people up in temporary housing and grinding says she's been trying to get one of those spots they told her the family could have a hotel room in Nashua New Hampshire about twenty miles away\nRight so unfortunately that's not gonna work we don't have a vehicle\nAnd her stepfather who also lives with them is getting cancer treatments nearby and can't be that far away Andrew mailer the manager of north Andover says a lot of people would rather stay home\nBut I think as it becomes multiple days of the next week or so were steadily in the thirties up in the evening that's not something that can be sustained in a safe way\nEspecially since there is a real concern that some space heaters might start fires Columbia gas spokesman dean Lieberman says they've taken in more than Twenty one thousand claims from customers for everything from damaged appliances to lost wages and they place more than ...
