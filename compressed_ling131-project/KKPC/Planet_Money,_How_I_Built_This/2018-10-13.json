NPR News Washington\nGermany thousands of demonstrators are marching in the streets of Berlin protesting rising racism and xenophobia ahead of tomorrow's state elections in Bavaria\nAs NPR psoriasis are hiding Nelson reports the far right alternative for Germany party is projected to decimate Chancellor Angela Merkel's key political ally loaders from the very end Christian social union\nOr see us you party had been flocking to the far right alternative for Germany faction in response to Chancellor Merkel's refugee policy they blame her for more than ... million asylum seekers who entered Germany over the past three years\nBut the conduct that definitely makes it sound he dependency his power on his ability to make other people powerful it was totally be life changing people in my own struck came up to me and said what happened that's what happened I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people [noise]\nThat of course I Want to know what I was doing that they knew how you find out you look at the eyes if their eyes are shining you know you're doing it [noise] if the ice unknown shiny you had to ask a question and this is the question\nWho am I being that my players eyes in China [noise]\nAnd you know I have a definition of success for me it's very simple it's not about wealth and fame and power it's about how many shiny eyes I have around me\nWalk me through your understanding of the physiological experience of of music or does it just was it what what happens to us\nWell it's a fascinating thing it's based in nature now we're talking about total music or aid to new music is another matter says something else but didn't total music if I go to\nA ... you know [noise]\nEverybody feels in that last snowed a desire which is in that note\nTo resolve itself to do and if it doesn't this of frustration there's a sense of expectation milk fulfilled\nAnd so since everybody feels that the composer can play with the total language in such a way that he can set up expectations satisfaction that sense of coming home the sense of being far removed from home and all the emotions\nThat human beings are capable of feeling ... can be represented the amusing [laughter]\n\nSo music is mode and raided it drives me we have an innate can change the way you experience something so it's like why when you watch a movie it can make you cry right\nBut if you saw that same movie without the music you wouldn't\nHave the same effect I mean there there's something\nMotive about music that pulls us in that kind of praise promotions and and I don't know why do you\nDo you know why well it it just seems that the other way can you imagine the movie without\nThe music that generates the emotions that releases the human experience\nAnd it does it of course through the way the\nThing about being the person right now that's going to continue to support Colorado Public radio and programming like this you can do that at CPR dot org or you can call one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nAnd if you do decide to give right now there's an extra benefit you're automatically entered into a sweepstakes to win a trip for two to London\nThis is a seven night trip to Britain you'll be given a fully loaded uh two card to explore the city some money to planned or some of what you're going to be doing when you're out there this is a huge opportunity and it comes thanks\nTo a CPR sponsors that put it together to encourage your participation in CPR its membership drives supporters like the IRA and British Airways they want you to give because they know this\nService really matters for Colorado it really matters for people like you\nAnd they want you to join us so you can do that at CPR dot org or call us one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nAnd the London sweepstakes it's a great reason to game right now is maybe you've never given to Colorado Public radio before again any amount is going to get you automatically entered to win that trip for two and eighty five hundred dollar value trip or to to London you can do ten dollars a month you can do Fifteen dollars a month\nAnd again if you do ten dollars a month we have a new gift it's a pair of funky CPR socks it's a brand new get for this drive so if you don't eat now you'll be one of the first people to get a pair of socks they have the CPR logo on them\nBe a lot of fun to wear around and again your gift of any amount is an automatic entry into the London sweepstakes CPR dot org is a place to give or you can call us a one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nSometimes it just sort of relieves that pressure then it just becomes about hearing someone's perspective\nSo you wouldn't responded to his argument you just listen to to what he said I might\nI might but I start by just listening and asking questions\nBut because he likes me and respects me usually he leaves an opening for me to express my feelings and I do I'm honestly without condemnation but you don't it's it's hard for people to open up\nYeah yeah it it's hard that makes you vulnerable yeah it's interesting 'cause it's\nVery true and yet he creates a conflict because you think well the act of listening suggest that\nThose views can be aired public like like you know the ... there's some things that you could say\nPeople should just keep it inside their heads because it's not\nAcceptable to save them or hear them out okay but how well has that worked\nBecause that's been our strategy so far yeah and we're still fighting the civil war\nLook I I\nI think you're right about that I I\nI think that makes sense but at the same time\nI Wonder whether it's a one way street because by being willing to listen to somebody else you're essentially sending a message that you are open minded person and that other person may not be open minded\n[noise] yeah but how do we as a society change that you know one of the things that struck me after the march in Charlottesville they went and interviewed the mother of the man who murdered the anti fascist protester yeah\nAnd she was stunned at what he was involved in and they said did you not know she said no no no no no we never we never talked about that stuff we don't talk about politics\nAnd I thought to myself I Wonder what would have changed in some of these mines\nIf people actually didn't avoid these conversations and allowed human compassion to eventually work because I think when you get isolated into an ideological bubble and you're only hearing people that I agree with you it pushes you further and further toward the fringes\nAnd the dangerous situation we find ourselves\nIn [noise] is that most Americans are now in an idiot logical bubble [noise] whether they're on the right or the left yeah so it's no longer going to be the fringes unless we begin to pop but the bubble and hear opinions that we find Republican it\nAnd so until we start listening to these opinions we don't like it's going to get worse\nCeleste Headley her book is called we need to talk had to have conversations that matter you can find her entire talk at ... dot com [noise]\nAnd what I liked about this conversation Celeste is that it's actually something that we can do to kind of make the world around us a little bit better and that's kind of a goal on the Ted radio hour we want to share ideas with you that give us hope and ideas that hopefully can make the world a little bit better and\nI think you know or I'm going with this because in order to bring those ideas to your radio we need public radio stations like the one you're listening to right now to get that message out so is this show is meaningful to you in any way please consider helping out\nBy getting to the station here's how\nCan
