when they will [noise]\n\nHow are you able to react that way like how are you able to to joke about things that other people might just pulled her hair out and get really angry ... blood with anger but\nWhen I was I think I think that the way to get people to pay attention is to not to them and to not appear like some raging person who wants to been around with that because actually I'm not like that I perfectly normal sensible human being who wants to try and make the best place\nAnd I'm very interested in keeping an eye here in the u._k. if the big increase in ratings that seems to be in the late night shows at all using humor as a weapon in the current political situation\nI think that is the way forward and nothing is more disarming to protect the new finding them funny to watch how do you call it a policy whose aim is to get equality for women the women's equality project why didn't you pretend and pulled in Idaho the pain can beg politics is wrong with you [laughter]\nIf yeah and also a life is full of things that we believe to be driven which are not true no woman ever been to ... in the sixties it was made up by a journalist\nI even looked it up on the Internet and I could not find anything about\nWhat happened was uh I can hold your mind only ... young as anything but uh there was a time when a Vietnam the people who didn't want to go in the Vietnam War but in the ... and that that idea was conflated with the protests that were held at the Miss America contest\nAt the deed crowned the sheep Miss America which is funny but nobody's instrument of that stuff that I Would have liked to say\nTo me this is a that's the thing like I suspect that you don't sit around and consciously think I Am going to use humor to advance my ideas but it just sort of your temperament\nIs ... ... absolutely and and I have to keep smiling bad things happen in the world look about things that make up every day I think really this is happening now which is so hot breaking pulling that the only thing I think you can do is you have to sell it to come back and get a that activism but\nAlso with remembering that by human beings and we have a sense of humor I don't see any other way forward frankly because if you just something about those things you would just so they\nKnow we're in the world for example the women have equal representation in positions of power okay let's get very quick look at the top one hundred companies in the London stock exchange in twenty sixty one hundred companies\nOr how many women running seven\nSeven or am I supposed to realize that seven I'll run by men will cooled Joan [noise]\n\nJohn running hundred company [noise]\nThere Jane run by men who have\n[noise]\nI'm sure David ... job okay [noise]\nWhy does it matter well it's that pesky business over the gender pay gap or guy in the wilds do women on the same as men and that is never going to change unless\nWe have more women at the top in the ... with the law or the equal pay act in Britain was posted in Nineteen Seventy five\nNevertheless there are still many many women who from early November until the end of the year by comparison to their male colleagues are effectively working for free I in fact the world Economic Forum\nEstimates that women will get equal pay\nI mean all the examples that you give in your talk like more companies are run by Dave's were John are women who run companies I mean it it would be funnier if it wasn't so depressing\nSign up I Know I'm ... I'm just trying to pointed out ah you know life is uh is is has many amusing sides to it ah I have to say Mr Trump bless him has been a boon frankly a boon to factor as well but\nOn my mother's you duress and I didn't get it because my parents were first cousins which they are [noise]\n\nIt only happens from accidents like what happened to me on my birthday now I must warrant it I'm not inspirational\nI don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me because at some point in your life you have dreamt of being disabled come on a journey with me it's Christmas Eve here at\nThe mall you're driving around in circles looking for parking\nAnd what do you say [noise]\nSixteen and the handicapped face it [noise]\nAnd you're like God can I just feel little disabled [noise]\n\nAlso I got to tell you I got Ninety nine problems on hold Li is just one [noise] as if there was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI I remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and oh you saw it live young that's our call so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nAgain [laughter] so I think the human capacity you\nKnow the way I'm humans get through these really terrible times is by flipping the script on themselves yeah it kind of let you take the story back into your own hands\nBegins own turn flipping the script happened when she was in college right after September eleventh and the start of a wave of Islamophobia\nAnd it started becoming clearer and clearer that Islamophobia is one of those things it's not going away\nI kept thinking like oh will be will hate Muslims for like a few months and then we'll stop [laughter] like I just thought there was going to be a reasonable trajectory [laughter]\nUm and then it never never stopped you know and um and I felt like I could you know I had a voice and that my voice as an Iranian American Muslim was not something that\nThe average American has already heard and so again decided that the best way to disarm the haters was to make them laugh and that's been the goal is just um\nYou know if you have never had a Muslim friend um maybe my stupid they can be or Muslim friend\nThe game does this through what she calls social justice comedy and how it works well here's the gains explanation\nFrom the stage\nIt can be broken up and just remain categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and Florida State category here are the haters\nComedian it's my goal to convert these hairs because they hate a lot of things which leads the negative outcomes like a racism violence and Ted Nugent on a plane is\nWe have to reckon with the haters but there's various within this group and it's not that they should go after all of that right someone created a highly scientific taxonomy of hate or they basically took all of haters I put them in a petri dish like a scientist and this is what I found that\nWe have the trolls they're the people who have quit their jobs so that they can post on Youtube videos all day long\nOn their haters now these people will be at a stoplight they'll wait for them to turn green and why they don't\nMost interested in is the swing hate or they just don't have enough information in the group I liked the target was social justice comedy because\nIt makes you laugh right I don't think you know state of openness and that moment of open it's a good social justice comedians can stick in a whole bunch of information and if they're really skilled erectile exam [noise]\nFor social justice for us it's not partisan okay this isn't political comedy this is about justice and no one is against justice\nIn a negative you know what you're sitting inside of a burrito\nLike either be hearing a real like an interesting treaties on income inequality that tasted a really sophisticated poo joke\nOkay so she wanted to do something about Islam a phobia and what to look for the swing haters\nSo me and another comedian ... decided to round up like a bunch of Muslim American comedians um as per usual\nAnd take him around the country to places like Alabama and Tennessee and Mrs in Arizona\nYou know what I mean just like places where you are accustomed to seeing like a bunch of friendly Muslims and we would duty street action we would set up like an ... in the middle of town square\nReally cautious about as long as it's not the joy just about our world join\nReplied them with pastries so that they can feel like hey someone who's going to give me pastries doesn't have it out for me\nWhat would people get tough\nOh my gosh they could ask literally any saying\nWhy some Muslim women look like you are right\nYou can't tell who they are Rob a bank and you can identify that's\nReally a good class you know so we got a question like that all over the country um you know because I don't know where that job and I don't you know coverage so you know so like people could ask those questions over\nI'm another question that was frequent was why don't Muslims denounce\nTerrorism don't why I haven't seen Muslims size you know\nWe got that everywhere and I continue to get that and my travels all over the country why don't Muslims denounced terrorism and so there's like a huge PR missteps that happened and where American thing that might come downstairs and I don't know\nHow this happened because literally every Muslim I Know done to her I'm like did we not like out of this happen\nWhen we come back the giver showed explains why it's important in social justice comedy to keep it delightful show today painfully funny guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\n[noise]\nSupport comes from the U.S Olympic Training

just hearing from comedian begin first saw it and she had a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up a conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patient [laughter]\nYeah I\nThink one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is uh\nA joint and shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip you took was the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came up something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster

it's about justice so we\nHave to change our fighting they get you a delightful posters kept biting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise] basically what I have a couple\nOf comedians took
