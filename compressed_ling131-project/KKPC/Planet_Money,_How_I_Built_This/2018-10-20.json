polling station when he detonated explosives killing and wounding police and civilians it is so far the biggest single attack on the election\nBut I'm curious because like to be able to do some time Martin I mean that the north of England is not has like the the greatest farmland in the world right\nWhere it makes no is is very much you know it's it's absolutely amount you know but we just talk about the need to get people talking you know because actually led there'll be decreasing amount of land in many parts of the world that we can go to our food down but we still need defeat us out\nSo we need to think about ... close it can come and go besides the buildings when of course we can and well I think it's that happened over the last nine years if people are suddenly on their eyes to space\nAnd seeing their environments and a completely different way and saw it happen to grow food on that I did some testing so even in the north of England we can change the way we live by thinking about where we grow things how do we grow things in ...\nI'm totally moving to time more than in the summer [laughter] yeah or it's great\n[noise] that ... that movement she started in tied Martin and now in towns all around the world is called incredible edible you can learn more about it and Pam's full time talking to Ted Ted dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay so fruits and vegetables in every corner and Todd Martin that's real food right but the problem is that in most modern supermarkets especially in America that is not what we eat\nYou know it's it's sort of the hands how you define things but I Would say a minimum of forty percent of the of the stuff in American supermarkets wouldn't really qualify as food by the\nDictionary deflation forty percent wouldn't qualify sued well if you think of food food than the definition of food is something that sustains nurses and the definition of nourishment is something that um increases your health\nSo if something is not increasing your health but make you ill it doesn't really leave the dictionary definition of food\nThat says food writer and cookbook author Mark Bittman his most famous cookbook actually one of the best selling of all time is simply called how to cook everything to people hug you and airports\n[laughter] it's happened to have that not often but yeah it's happened\nAnyway marches that most of what we eat today isn't real food but it wasn't always like that as Mark Bittman on the ...\nA hundred years ago just what everyone was a local for every family how to cook usually a mom and those moms fought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of Europe [noise]\nThere was no snack food and until the twenties or do Clarence birds I came along there was no frozen food [noise]\nMargarine didn't exist\nIn fact when margarine was invented several states pass laws declaring that have had to be died tank so we all know that it was a fake there were no restaurant chains eating ethnic was on her of unless you were ethnic [noise]\nIn those days there was no philosophy of food you just ate you didn't claim to be anything fats cards pro teams they weren't bad or good there were food you eighth ... hardly anything can pay more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient\nThe corn flakes hadn't been invented the cops are at the ... cheese whiz none of that stuff goldfish swam\nAnd again every one aide local in New York and orange was a common Christmas presents because they came all the way from Florida from the thirties on road systems expand the trucks took the place of railroads fresh fruit began to travel more oranges became common in New York\nThe south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland\nEffective as you're well known there everywhere and the deficit family farms as part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato or even in summer\nEventually California produced too much food to shift fresh so it became critical to market can than frozen foods loss arrived convict\nAnd again you can't believe drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans once you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy so\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nThere are some people who are consuming thirty forty fifty teaspoons of added sugar per day so we've been sort of updating our sugar anti for many many years and of course that's why type two diabetes first became a huge problem in the Nineteen twenties and heart disease and the Nineteen thirties\nAnd then something happens in the Nineteen eighties high fructose corn syrup happened\nBut so is is corn syrup half of his contract worse than can sugar\nIt's cheaper but they're both equally bad and they're both equally bad but if it's cheaper it's that it's worse and\nWhat that does is also makes sugar cheaper because of the competition plus that was exactly at the same time the low fat directive came out of the U. S. D. A. and the FDA Nineteen Seventy seven the first dietary goals for Americans said eat less fat\nWell if you eat less fat the food tastes like cardboard the food industry knew that so what they do they pumped into sugar and now high fructose corn syrup was cheaper so they could do it ... miles let me give you an example of how this works ... my favorite product of all time lucky charms\nYeah they're magically delicious Hadar right why they're marshmallows in the box cutter delicious secondary by other marshmallows in the box or\nBecause they're fun to eat 'cause marshmallows or sheep and goats are expensive to take up more room in the box and they can sell them for more wow great business\nYou know [noise]\nSo everyone says education educate the public as you get published tell what's going on except for one thing education has it worked for any other substance abuse the Nancy Reagan was just saying no work\nReally so\nWhere does that leave us everyone says wait a second don't tell me what to eat well you know what you've already been told what to eat where were you for the last forty years as your food supply was being changed under your nose where you're protesting then\nEveryone says get government out of my kitchen you know I don't want government my kitchen either unless there's somebody\nMore dangerous already there okay so the real question is who the hell do you want in your kitchen the government\nWho will take your freedom and your wallet\nOr the food industry who's already checking your freedom your wallet and your health\nThat's your only choice [noise]\n\nSomething given a choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food and the answer is\nCan they absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states\nOf that four hundred fifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent\nIs chronic metabolic disease of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry's mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer is real food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable\nFor everyone at that weight I'm assuming the sugar industry really hate you sure yeah in\nIn ten words or less yeah they they they love me yeah that's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public to make its own informed decision and then but not\nMany people are saying what you're saying I mean\nYou know look there's a lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interest other than taking care of children and seeing\nChildren get to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's vested interest [noise]\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you in college yeah just a little bit\nOf course now and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert for dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal with orange juice and take capri sun and\nA granola bar and that's all before three o'clock you know then you've got a problem\n[noise]\nForever let's take is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at Ted that NPR dot org were back in just a minute stay with us on the
