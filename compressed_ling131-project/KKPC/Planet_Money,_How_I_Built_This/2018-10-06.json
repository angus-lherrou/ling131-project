C. and the hours before the Senate is expected to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice among them is twenty five year old Matty laboratory who traveled from Scranton, Pennsylvania\nIt's just hard in this country that you love and believe in and have so much for it to me and told that when it's all about it and I feel like that's what I got from everyone kind of an eye and\nMeanwhile on the Senate floor of this hour lawmakers are delivering speeches supporting and opposing Kavanaugh though as NPR's Amy held reports it's all about a foregone conclusion that Kavanaugh will take a seat on the high court as early as next week\nThirty hours have been taking down to today's final confirmation vote after the Senate advanced Kavanaugh's nomination on friday Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the only Democrat who has indicated he will vote for him\nMentioned was one of four undecided senators who signaled their support for Kavanaugh yesterday mentioned was explaining that he waited for Republicans Susan Collins to do it first I knew when I saw she was going to do that I have tried to\nWatch [noise] then I [noise]\nWhen he was interrupted by protesters shouted sham and the Democrats are hoping to marshal the national protests over how the allegations were handled into votes in next month's midterm elections Amy held NPR News Washington\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo

authoritarian\nIn the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast nine to human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that costs cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets and companies have already raised almost a billion dollars to apply for for ... as a therapy and patience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs of the last couple of decades\nBut five years ago when I started my PHD with Jennifer Doudna CRISPR wasn't that technology at all [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo you're saying there's technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how fast has become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's lab that was to any ten\nYou wouldn't find a single mention of CRISPR\nIn you know the lay media unless it was talking about a vegetable CRISPR are but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out\nWe now or at a point today where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't know about Chris ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR to how to study whatever biological question they go after and their laboratories because\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works and if we do that\nDNA encodes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what the effects are\nOkay the technical details of how CRISPR cash nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly enter spaced short\nPalin dramatic repeat and cash nine is the key protein that makes it all work but what you need to know if that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy in a relatively inexpensive to any genes in precise waste any gene ... any living thing from bacteria to people\nComing back to the four letters of DNA thinking about those eight hundred dictionaries filled\nWith the same for letters and now I imagine that you have to\nSearch for a single page and not just single page but a single letter on that page and mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an a to a tea not an easy ... or an agency so for decades this was the kind of pie in the sky science fiction idea that we could dream about doing\nBut no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter\nAbsolutely that's exactly what it does and I'll just add one company out it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so if you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of\nGetting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patience\nNow the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health can be achieved this ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine the future you stem cell technology together as Chris protests nine to remove disease cells from patients repair them in the lab and the transplant those corrected cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience\nAnd I expect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with Christopher entering the pipeline of the next few years what really got folks speaking this past year was the report in may but for the first time ever\nAll those things right I think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific\nGenetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside so what a friend you nailed delivered it into a fertilized egg so into a human embryo so that that future child\nEven though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity you might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits still inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variants into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against this thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting a gene editing into kind of\nSorry my thing too good to be true but uh when you would fit minister\nOr fat or either psychological\nUh you get the same results namely identical twins separated at birth show are quite astonishing similarities\nThat just I don't know ... so then like even things like like habits or or personality clerks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and the jails and the first couple of years of life\nAre there are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know\nYeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you undergo a trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars but I think there are certainly a um their statistical forces there's there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah I mean when when you think about like who you are I mean do you do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself as basically the same kind of person I like seeing music I like same foods\nI like the St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests are and then and research on personality shows that there is a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character a as they go through life\nBut a ... there are certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred in most people would say that they get older we get less and your article we get nicer\nAh we get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty uh he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nSending it if we are more or less the same right at twenty or at Seventy is it even possible to make big changes to who we are I\nThink we ever has to be a change our behavior which is really what counts I I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and that easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are proven effective at reducing anxiety and phobias in treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that that those don't appeal to a some if you are real immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe just kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry is so intricately complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social um mechanisms of of interacted to language to facial expression their body language that there are ways of of changing our\nFeelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and uh and and art and evidence based psychotherapy\nSo there is a scope for for a range of behavior within the ... all of a given personality type and we can probe the outside of the ... the genes make available to us\n[noise] do you when you think about what what enemy to person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because the interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are a attempt to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion sensors and no one can keep track of all of them even a ... in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or environments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together not not the exotic cases of beer twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins at all of us know\nIf you know ... a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar to people plucked off the street at random but they're unique individuals that they you you don't confuse them when once you know and sometimes they're not France and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a\nNow how do you account for those differences it's not fair I jeans at least not the ones they inherited from their parents that could be some uh a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic required\nA it's not there by and large the environments because they grew up and do the same parents the same school the same house the same older subs seemed younger sibs\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a for a chance for the role of the dice in or who have become because uh [noise] two people who have everything in common both the genes and the environmental level nonetheless don't turn out to be a distinguishable\nHarvard psychologist Steven Pinker has given several attacks including this one about the blank slate you can find all of them at ... dot com\nMore ideas about what makes us I guess
