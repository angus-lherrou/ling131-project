NPR News Riyadh\nOfficials are now essentially doubling the number of people they say died in Florida as a result of hurricane Michael which hit there last week Florida State officials updating their death toll today\nState officials did not provide details of how the victims deaths were storm related a dozen of the deaths apparently occurred in ... county a seaside area which took a direct hit from Michael nearly a week after it roared ashore as a powerful category for hurricane upwards of a hundred and Ninety thousand homes and businesses in the southeast are still without power\nA spike in the federal deficit has members of Congress concerned including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell NPR's Scott Horsley reports the deficit jumped Seventeen percent last year mostly because of the GOP tax cuts\nThe deficit ballooned to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars in the last twelve months a remarkable tired of reading for a country not mired in recession or widespread war\nThe increase stems largely from tax cuts and hike in military spending but in an interview with Bloomberg Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell blame the big entitlement programs Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nOr there's been a bipartisan reluctant to tackle entitlement changes because the popularity of those programs hopefully at some point here we've got serious about the ...\nThe federal deficit is expected to grow to more than a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nThe number of help wanted ads going up in August to its highest level in nearly two decades showing the economy growing strongly over the summer\nWell they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent Palmdale here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation into the disappearance of this Washington Post columnist\nOn U.S officials haven't weighed in about all of these reports in the news at the Saudis are now for a train that says like an interrogation done horribly wrong we don't know exactly how the Saudis have been spinning this with ... in private or if he believes them but\nWe do know that President Trump seems to at least according to his Twitter feed Trump says he spoke by phone to the ground brands who was ... at the time and he says that the crown prince\nIsn't this is the quote on Twitter totally denied any knowledge of what took place in the consulate\n[noise] it does seem as though Pompeo has been sent to walk this really fine line President Trump is threatened severe punishment and his words to whoever's responsible for ... parents may be murder but but there's also a lot more at stake here in the in the wider us Saudi relationship\nYeah and in this country Mary Louise is is really key to the Mideast strategy and the Trump Administration there are big us arms deals\nAt stake these are U.S policy on Iran is is a vital here the sanctions are going back into force and they the U.S needs the Saudis\nTo keep the oil market stable um and then on the other hand the administration is facing a lot of pressure from Congress and members of Congress are outraged over this apparent murder in the consulate in Istanbul and over the Saudi conduct in the war in Yemen so I think you're totally right there the administration is trying to walk this very fine line\nA secretary payers headed next ah which means we're headed next to the capital of turkey to Ankara what the agenda there\nWell he's going to be meeting with the um foreign minister there obviously turkey is also really important ally in a country that wants to get to the bottom of this do I'm ... I'm In turkey today we're searching the Saudi conflict and they found evidence that this Saturday um\nJournalists was killed there um so it it's going to be to follow up on those investigation that to NPR's\nMichele Kelemen reporting from Saudi Arabia\nIs not just governments figuring out how to deal with Saudi Arabia Israel and the suspect to death of ... the major corporations are distancing themselves from my kingdom top executives have pulled out of an investment conference scheduled to take place in Riyadh next week they include leaders of J. P. Morgan and Ford\nAndrew Ross Sorkin to the New York times also plans to attend and moderate panels not only did he pull out he was also now reporting on how CEOs made the decision to withdraw from the Saudi conference and he joins us now welcome thank you for having me you say this incident is forcing business executives to become reluctant statesmen why reluctant\nWell I think that over the past year or two really under the Trump Administration CEOs have been forced into these uncomfortable positions of having to speak out on moral issues this conference in Riyadh known as ... in the desert has become a crucible of sorts\nFor so many CEOs over the past week and all of it being done without really direction from Washington I'm treasures eggers Stephen ... is still going\nCEOs have been left to make these hard decisions what's on the line for these CEOs wise at such a hard decision\nUm the Saudis look at attendance of something like this as a show of faith in their country as a show of loyalty and so the idea that somebody like Jamie ... would decide not to attend\nReally puts potentially the employees the business at risk real profits you report on the actual phone calls where the CEO's were making these decisions over the weekend what went into\nTheir ultimate decision to pull out of this conference I think for most of them this reported murder was one step too far you have customers know so much more about what's happening in real time reacting\nProviding feedback to executives on these issues in a way that they did so in the same way that consumers\nMight expect executives to take a position on immigration or same sex marriage you're saying there could be consequences if they did not take a position on this issue\nAbsolutely in particular the view is that over the past two years and again I Do think\nIt goes back to this particular administration these executives have come out so forcefully taking a moral position whether it was on Charlottesville whether it was on immigration what there was on the Paris climate accord they felt compelled to do those things\nAs you know the news cycle moves fast and memories are short do you think this will have long term consequences or is it pretty quickly just going to get washed downstream and things will go back to normal\nI think for some of these companies frankly I think they're going to be real implications for their business Richard Branson had announced last week but she was going to step away from Saudi Arabia literally this afternoon\nThe Saudis are canceling the virgin hyper loop infrastructure project that they put together in retaliation\nYou know after what might have been described as a skirmish between Canada\nAnd Saudi Arabia over the summer the Saudis literally told their financial in investment managers to sell all of their investments in stakes in Canadian companies as retribution\nFor what they saw as a hostile ACT UP when the Canadians criticized the country for some human rights related issues\nAndrew Ross Sorkin writes the ... column for the New York times thanks for joining us and if you're having\nSunshine is the weather word today across much of

considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly when hurricane Michael barreled through Florida it also crashed right into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and a critical one\nAnd candidates vying for the governor's seat and a U.S Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nRevving up their meanwhile here is his opponent this is Republican Ron dissent is on his way to the panhandle to help out ... years\nWe're going to wind up there on\nThe folks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... he's the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he has been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott at sea bass gay welcome to the program that you are again Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect and the governor's race in the race for the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor is the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm and the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency\nTo sort of a help this state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted to what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a profile as first lady has stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left ... Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee\nRick Scott though he's not formally campaigning he was listening a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand\nThe point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaign\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month's October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest hit comedy of the mall and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone\nThere are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governors Scott issued executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of voting locations\nSo that you have these super voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but everyone's vote would be protected\nHas hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on him and I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls but hurricane Michael ... was a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which is of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical of whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning has been reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're grateful for the health they're getting from first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government find a give people hope\nSteve ... he's Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane Michael on politics in Florida Steve ... thanks so much\nThanks where all these Obamacare won't be on ballots in next month's elections but the fate of the eight year old health care law and other ambitious healthcare initiatives could be decided depending on which party wins control of Congress NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what's at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign at\nI don't talk about it much but does he face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and as a requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans in ...\nThey will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how Democrats around the country have seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler who directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign at out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care this year it's the mirror image\nOf what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless at how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that ...\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans want the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization what\nYou're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermine the AC a\nLoo Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of that now Blue Cross Blue Shield entering the medical insurance company here\nEven if they win a sweeping midterm victories Democrats won't have the power to pass Medicare for all but they might\nJump start the conversation I had to the next election in two years\nScott Horsley NPR News Washington [noise]", "show_name": "Northeast
