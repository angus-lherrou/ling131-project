Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year in Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota\nAll requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention ... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of an why use Brennan\nCenters voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to\nCommonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the ... some\nCases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nThe ride hailing apps Hoover is predicting it's super each restaurant food delivery service will grow to cover Seventy percent of the U.S population by the end of the sheer\nCompany says a

starring Steve corral and Timothy shower may now playing\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Audie Cornish the Trump Administration says it's taking action against some of the Saudi officials at the leaves are responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal to show James secretary of state my palm pale made the announcement today\nWe've identified at least some of the individuals responsible including those in the intelligence services the royal court the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries who we suspect to have been involved in Mr to show that we're taking appropriate actions which include revoking basis entering visa lookouts and other measures\nMeanwhile Gina Haspel the head of the CIA is in Turkey today to investigate because you'll just killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that is it a welcome Greg hey so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said stumble along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nThe CIA never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe how things to take place there um and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they're conducting these sort of ... separate investigations\nBut there's also negotiations going on um this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement and some sort of negotiation so that's a key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending Haspel there\nWell the president clearly wants to stay in very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his response is um he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about thinks he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and word should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and Mike Pompeo to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who was responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place in\nThe meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\n[noise] yeah I think we saw today president hurdle won gave this big speech and he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis\nAnd and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia are rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent Sunni Muslim country um turkey has a very bad economy they would like investment from Saudi Arabia Saudi a contract\nSo the Turks are likely to keep playing this out drawing it out where whereas the Americans and the Saudis would would probably like to have to finish it up pretty quickly\nUm the ... the Turks have or we believe the audiotapes um there's still the question where the body is so I talked to to Bruce ... of the Brookings Institution um and here's what he had to say about the the Turkish thinking\nI think are to want to enjoy watching a BS twist and the wind and I think he's probably going to play that game for some time to come\nIn the meantime you mentioned the Saudis wanting to move on quickly how have they responded to all this wealth\nToday was the beginning of this big business conference or in the capital Riyadh the so called Davos in the desert\nAnd Mohammed bin some on the crown prince NBS of backed out but then he made a surprise cameo appearance in and got a standing ovation so this is clearly the Saudi playbook to a\nTo a business as usual let's find a way out of this and move on the big question of course will be will Mohammed bin some on remain as the crown prince his father is in his eighties an ailing a so far NBS is still in line to succeed him\nThat's NPR's Greg Myre thank you for your reporting\nThank you and leaving hearing the killing of Saudi journalist ... has sparked international outrage the people right here in the u._s. or else they're talking about the incident and how President Trump has been handling it\nNorth Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports on how it's playing out among voters and us media outlets just two weeks before the midterm elections\nMorality and her friend Boston Neary work in publishing and live near Burlington, Vermont both say they're definitely voting next month both describe themselves as into\nWhen I ask if they are paying attention to the ... case they nod their heads we actually were discussing it in the car on the way down here\nWe meet on the street in Virginia Vermont where the tour shopping and leave peeping variety says she's troubled by President Trump's focus on money and an arms deal with the Saudis rather than seeking justice for a slain journalist if he was murdered\n'em I don't think that his biggest concerns for the person you get on that and find out and make an educated decision it was a human being\nNeary agreed says she thinks Trump's tone just isn't right\nI I think that sums it up more transparent moral leadership [noise]\nThe right thing this narrative\nQuestioning Trump's moral compass on the ... case has played over and over and media that tends to be critical of the president here's Joe Scarborough on MSNBC\nAnd then he was killed and he was dismembered and Donald Trump's response hey we get a lot of money from their or Trump's values are not American values buzzer Donald Trump's values\nBut in conservative tilting media friendly to President Trump this sounds very different the Washington Post last week described a whisper campaign by conservative commentators and activists ended discredited showed some suggesting possible ties to Muslim radicals\nThis narrative has been taken up by Republican politicians including Corey Stewart a candidate for US Senate in Virginia who spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper that's for sure when\nHe was ... was not a good guy himself\nWhat does that mean exactly not not a good guy himself well I ... I mean there's a lot of stuff out there a\nOne voice leading this attack on the show but she is Rush Limbaugh less than three weeks after the Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist was brutally killed\nLimbaugh used his influential radio show on friday\nTo describe the show G. as suspicious a man unworthy of the president's concerns during there's no whisper about this cabinet whispering anything when I talk about this I'm ... from the tops on Saturday the Saudis acknowledge ... died in their embassy\nBut many conservative outlets have simply downplayed his death like President Trump they've focused attention instead on that caravan of migrants moving north through Central America and Mexico Peter ... is the host of the program Fox and friends it will be time to deploy the military I Believe so because we haven't changed our immigration\nPolicies we this issue immigration did seem far more significant to many of the voters we spoke to they ranked protecting America's borders as a higher priority for Trump ... case Mike downs is a retired state trooper in Westport New York a Democrat who says he'll be voting Republican this year\nTrump is on the right track trying to correct to certain things like for instance the immigration you know we watch it on television you you know I feel sorry for these people but we can't police the whole world\nWith voting already underway and parts of the country are interviews didn't find the Trump's handling of the show ... killing appeared to be changing many minds about him or the mid term elections those who favor the president seemed on troubled by the case or weren't paying that much mind", "show_name": "Northeast Report - Late Edition", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "23"}
