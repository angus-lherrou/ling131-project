latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many as ...\nA more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either I first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office as you know it's usually very tight lipped in but I did decide to speak about this uh\nAnd it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller so allegations that would date back to time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down an individual with an empty provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nOn the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote\nA but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you

shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to them on a Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome\nThank you it's great to be here and we'll start with a very basic question but it's a question that still confound me why aren't Jews such a focus for white nationalist [noise]\nYou know for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of rightness the superior\nAnd a real intention to maintain that kind of superiority both on on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how those transpire between people\nBut also on ... on a national level through our politics on through the way that we talk about and document our history authored a way that we manage our institutions and it's an effort to maintain power and to keep people who are different um marginalized 'em and separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white ... much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh\nEighty to Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background\nTo white nationalist or you know are Jewish community here in the United states largely comes from immigrant backgrounds or to come from backgrounds have a strong ethnic identity when we came to this country and all we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin\nAnd just certain kinds of white minutes we're both elevated and celebrated in this country as far as our history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of Jews different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threat\n[noise] people of color are visibly different and because of that and we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate from those who have more\nSkinned privilege because her skin presents later or wider and then in contrast we think about the hatred and Jews and if we assume that most Jews are white in this country then we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identities\nSo do you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but if there is something different about it now\nWhat's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional positions that have traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic you think that's the new\nI think when we have our policy makers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes as fact\nAnd using fear to marginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different and the other thing that's different\nIs the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified\nSaid what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employees to combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember\nIs that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us and so the the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marching down our streets that we know each one of us we're going to come out of our houses to support the other\nThat we will not question who needs who needs this kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture as a as a as a as a as a nation and as a people that is our most important strategy right now\nA lotta Kaufman is director of the Jews of color field building initiative thank you

mobster in England\nAnd he did something else he corrupted the agents and cops so that he turned the Federal Bureau of investigation into would've sexually was Bolger bureau of investigation and they

buy tipping him off by taking is money by becoming beholden damn as\nThey should have been a big old or the FBI they enabled empowered in older than him even giving them the names of these would be
