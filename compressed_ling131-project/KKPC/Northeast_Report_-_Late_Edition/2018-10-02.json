and rock and roll Russians things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually started age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh happened when he was Seventeen years old\nTo be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but there were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rock is parties his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington

an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand ah sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad\nHundreds and Kansas Senate or boy\nAnd he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling a are

about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician the Democratic\nParty and his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise came with a very honest and emotional letter message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back

he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you

a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because a prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffered from severe\nSkin color dimension his lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things of that state's six to execute inform\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or a psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing you cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's gets a frantic word delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murdered after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to stay looks forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision
