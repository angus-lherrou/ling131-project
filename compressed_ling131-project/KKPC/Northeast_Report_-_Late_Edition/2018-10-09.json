article exploring what happened to show game fifty nine year old Saudi dissident and journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a week ago today\nAnd was never seen walking out Robin Wright wrote that New Yorker article she is a long time chronicle or of the middle east who's been visiting Saudi Arabia since Nineteen eighty one and she joins me now Robin good to speak with you\nGood to be with you [noise] let me flip back on you that question that you posed in the New Yorker how real a possibility is it that Saudi Arabia murdered Saudi journalist Jamal ...\nIt's just stunning that there is no proof of life now in a week and that the Saudis have offered no explanation for what happened to him his fiance waited for eleven hours outside of the conflict and\nFinally because he left his cell phone behind with a warning to call ... she did and that's where we stand and that's as little as we know today\nThe Saudis have offered a denial of any involvement the embassy here in Washington put out a statement calling or any claims of involvement outrageous and expressing concern for ... well being um it sounds as though you take those two miles with a grain of salt\nWell I'm very struck by the fact and all that talk to me quite frequently over the past year about the threats he felt to his life even being in Washington DC\nYou've known him for decades I should mention I've known him for a long time and Jamal head I've talked to him quoted often over the past year and\nHis growing criticism about the government effectively led by the crown prince Mohammed bin film on and he he told me in August that he was worried about a threat to his life and said that the kingdom would like to see him out of the picture as he put it\nI think he didn't realize how real that possibility what they are otherwise he would not have gone into the consulate\nIn Istanbul yeah you're right that\nThe mystery surrounding his disappearance fits into a broader pattern a trend of silencing just sent it to me about that what's the pattern that you see\nThe pattern is a clamp down on activists even as the\nGovernment talks about reforms in modernizing society and opening up to whether it's women wore the young a social life and allowing movie theaters for the first time it's very striking that that Keenan jak as it\nAllowed women to drive also started picking up some of the biggest women activists one was recently been sentenced to death and one of the most striking things drum Oliver said to me\nWith quite recently when he said that the crown prince was totally autocratic and\nTotally a liberal and that he was concerned not just for his own life but for others which had led him\nTo take a position he never thought he would remember this is a man who was a reluctant dissident he was someone who had supported the monarchy and still didn't principle it was the type of role and and the tactics\nOf the young crank print that had led him to worry about his own life and to speak out for the first time after years of saying nothing on his own friends were\nArrested how far outside the realms of what is normal in Saudi Arabia are the crown princes tactics I mean Saudi Arabia as you well know it's never claimed to be a liberal democracy\nLook there are many murders governments around the world and Saudi Arabia has arguably the most abysmal record on human rights of any country in the world but this kind of\nExtra territorial action is really very unusual and a crackdown against someone who's not in Saudi Arabia crack down on people who shouldn't be the face\nOf a new young person who claimed that he was a reformer really is very telling about the state of the kingdom\nThank you Robin thank you\nThat's the New Yorkers Robin Wright speaking with us about the disappearance of Saudi writer and dissident Jamal ...\nIt's been a little more than a year since the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace\nSexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct animal training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places on the rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as new\nPeter shell skin tone of shelf deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until you can call in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy originally written down Sabbath\nOn his radar he says he'll supply you know one more bureaucratic hurdles\nThat we're not used to certainly for because of course\nFrank Kenya is Rochester base human resources consultant his clients are small businesses he says even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with at this point\n... estimates over half of the state small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise than New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including lived trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions and then requires feedback from the employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York state you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is a New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd you don't have training that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protective category noxious sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but had been he says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer knock during this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about", "show_name": "Northeast Report - Late Edition", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "09"}
