G President Trump has emphasized weapons deals between the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nI don't like the concept of stopping and investment of a hundred and ten million dollars into the United states\nA hundred and ten billion dollars NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre ... is here to take a closer look at that number Hi Greg hey Mary Louise I'm a hundred and ten billion is that the state of the current arms deals between the U.S in Saudi Arabia or\nNo it is not ah the president seems to be mixing some old contract some current contracts in some hope for a contract we spoke to some people who study this including Bruce ... at the Brookings Institution\nHe noted that during the Obama administration the Saudis bought about a hundred and twelve billion dollars worth of us weapons so they that was in that ballpark\nBut those contracts are mostly come completed by now and here's what right Elle said when I asked him about the state of sales with the current administration\nSense Donald Trump has been president United States and Saudi Arabia have concluded less than four billion dollars worth of arms agreements\nLess than four billion dollars so that is a big gap do we know how much the Saudis actually do spend are currently spending on weapons from the U.S well\nThey do spend a lot and they really ramped up their defense spending in recent years particularly because of this a protracted war they're fighting in Yemen and in fact their defense budget is now considered to be the third largest in the world trailing only the United states and China\nAnd last year we've seen reports they bought three point four billion dollars of weapons from the U.S far more than any other country so as a general principle the Saudis are the biggest weapons fire from the United states not on the scale that the president has suggested\nOkay so that hundred and ten billion may be aspirational I kinda wish list but what kind of weapons have they bought\n[noise] so the fighter planes in the F. Fifteen or really the most significant single purchase right now because they're using that daily in Yemen and the bombing campaign has now been going on for more than three years\nBut the Saudis don't have a lot of big contracts at the moment as as we just heard and it's really the United states that that has the leverage because the in this relationship right now because of the way it supports in supplies the Saudi air force here's ... again\nTonight President Trump told the king he was cutting off spare parts to Saudi air force to Saudi air force would be grounded tomorrow morning\nAnd the president has said that if the U.S doesn't sell weapons to the Saudis in Russia or China would step in and do it but it's it's really not that simple of red tail noted that\nYou can't simply strap a Chinese bomb on an American F. fifteens ... systems have to talk to one another so the Saudis really would be in a tough spot in the United states were to use that leverage and cut them off\nAnd look ahead with me gr I have the Saudis made any kind of finance in terms of what arms deals that are looking for in the future\nIt's a big one that sort of been under some sort of discussion is a missile defense system but again they've spent an awful lot of money on the war in Yemen and they're not necessarily seen as being in the market for a big new contract right now\nSecond point the U.S Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has to approve these contracts and the Democrats in some Republicans are quite upset with the way the Saudis\nAre prosecuting the war in Yemen and for the past year so they've really been reluctant and it doesn't look like it would be an easy go for the Saudis to get a new\nContract That's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you Greg thank you\nLooked like the guys are supposed to stay steady and mostly clearer today around Denver and Boulder hides in the mid forties this is Colorado Public radio news things for listening and supporting us during our fallen membership drive\nIt might have felt a lot more like winter then fall this past weekend now with that now but so far there's no snow in the forecast for this week for the front range clear skies from Fort Collins to Pueblo today hides in the forties and thirties today in the mountains around veil\nSupport comes from doctors Kevin Patterson and Julianna ... pass quality of Denver metro MS dedicated to the art and science of oral facial and dental implant surgery or more at D.

did it play out did this plea deal comes the surprise\nYou know I Can't really say it's a surprise ever since he was indicted in June it seemed as if things were moving in the direction of a plea deal\nProsecutors had copies of his electronic messages with reporters taxed encrypted messaging apps and that made it a hard case to defend now Wolfe was charged this year with three felony counts of lying\nBut in this plea deal hell only plead guilty to one which means he likely faces zero to six months in prison and the judge ... brown Jackson let him go home today\nAs long as he promises to

with and did not meant to sharing any classified information\nThe defense team also says they're going to emphasize has long public service when he sense later this year it\nPut this into context for us because the Trump Administration has made a point of saying it wants to crack down on leaks and on leakers does this case represent that in fact happening on are they doing more beyond this case

these cases and even when they don't charge a compromise or leaks of classified information like they did not in this James was case\nFor people who are interrogated or investigated by the FBI there's always a risk that they could charge you with lying to investigators instead that's exactly what happened to James we'll hear and could be happening down the line with other subjects and targets of
