trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh the president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen ex background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means\nYou're in a house three days and to the pro NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in Studio ... either let's start with the big sticking point so far which has been a question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking at you know a Democrats as we've heard if complain that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that uh the administration's but strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat said the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they said that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this ah they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nA today the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly\nUh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in the background investigation that said Trump said today that well he has final say are you listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has had a Republican leadership said they want the Seattle cancer\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope were almost inevitable a on this question of senior a set of GPA pointed comments at city Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge a grandma also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh those allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSource I mentioned this is day three of the FBI is a week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing in those three day so far with\nThe euro itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned up the FBI is interviewed Ramirez\nUh she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witness the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out before it at this point it also had to reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat next\nUh and then there are a number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legit events in question when of course his cabinet us read mark judge we talk a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI or because his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more if Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWas the last twenty four hours a former friend if Kavanaugh is that you came out a publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drinker Kavanaugh when they were at you know a says Kevin was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nOr but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kavanaugh did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the cabin on that thing you are it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin those truthfulness about\nIs drinking his truthfulness in his testimony that it's a something that should be looked at it when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin I said to stay with us Ryan Lucas thanks Ryan again [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you're listening to

three days into its week long investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to understand what a supplemental pro but this type might entail we reached out to\nJack ... he's a former FBI agent he's conducted plenty of background probes into federal judges and he walked me through how he would go about this one if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home perhaps Dr Ford to ride around with agents we don't have much time and we have to do it quickly if we can limit\nThe neighborhood where the general area and we might be able to find out they're also real estate records available that you have to be I Would investigate\nLet me just start with the first example you would actually have Christine Blasey Ford in a card with you and just drive around the neighborhood and see if that draws her memory to point out the house I absolutely would also and you would try to look for what you said for plans of houses in the neighborhood you match the description from her memory I Would\nIn her memory is there is a living room right inside the front door stairway up to a bedroom on one side and the bathroom across the hallway we're looking for that\n[noise] what else would you do judge Kavanaugh offered some written calendars from his high school years what would you do with those calendars\nOur interview everyone much calendar and the crucial time period is summer middle of the summer or so July Nineteen eighty two\nAnd what else what else do you think is manageable to do within one week\nWell to do it quickly you can do a polygraph of all three people involved in the alleged sexual assault judge Kevin ... mark judge and a doctor for you good polygraph all three of them\nOkay there are allegations that involve Kavanaugh's behavior well under the influence of alcohol um during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough job of his drinking habits in high school and in college\n[noise] yes I was in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want that on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn up information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have said a background investigation I cannot what tell me why do\nI I Do because of the training the FBI yeah it's\nReally a while the staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country frequently and the agents who signed this case agents on backgrounds are well trained who've done it many times\nIt turns out the FBI find information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court does he happy I have a responsibility to pursue those additional leads\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and unlimited scope recording to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth with those additional interviews\nDo you think the FBI has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't uh at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI good request additional time if they're found new evidence new information about the wide background is being conducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the quest\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nOh You're welcome Elsa thank you even as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so with only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced cabinet questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president for sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the s\nI. investigation that was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices\nBack then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued\nA challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis species labs and only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are native species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court rulings stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along", "show_name": "Marketplace",
