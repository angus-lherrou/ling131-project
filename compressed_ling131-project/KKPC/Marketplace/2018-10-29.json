fear about immigrants from Mexico from Guatemala and Honduras and and the so called caravan are immigrants from a Muslim countries he's very concerned about and has stirred up a lot of fear about but\nWe have a home grown hate movement in the United states and the the mass shooting at the synagogue is just the most recent example of it\nHow seriously do you think we need to take this home grown hate movement and do you think that that we as a nation and that our government is taking it seriously enough\nI don't think we're taking it seriously enough that I'm not sure it would be possible to take it seriously enough I think it's potentially the greatest threat that we face I'm just if you look at last week with three major incidents of of\nFar right extremist and terrorism and and our country at I think that that that's a much more real threat than for instance that a caravan of of immigrants that that's thousands of miles away and and and that is hoping to potentially come here and get jobs and\nI let it snow Charlottesville on a mix of course\nYeah of course um the other thing is that among these really have a valid white nationalist groups and I didn't really understand when I began reporting this book that at that white nationalist tend to blame juice for almost everything and you know and and so I think when we see something like the ACL report\nSaying that last year was that was one of the largest years for for threats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand accidents and it's\nUnfortunately not surprising to me because these are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through\nBringing in immigrants through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of the violent backlash and from from the white supremacist idea\nIs this an unnerving time for you ...\nYeah it's it's a hugely and every time for me and in part because when something when something like the synagogue shooting happens and\nI feel a haunted and depressed but I don't feel shocked and you know in order to feel shock you have to be surprised and unfortunately these kinds of incidents are not surprising to me anymore and in fact it seems like there's a certain kind of inevitability and that is true in terms of mass shootings in general at\nThat that this country has not been able to address resolve and but it's also increasingly true in terms of you know acts of hate at you know I don't think that

said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border\nPoses a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so they're already something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nOr just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still we still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas\n... a barrier is more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter is also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well that that's where the visual say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or their own leaders support role again\nAnd the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction to federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't

dozen package bombs too high profile Democrats critics of President Trump and CNN made his first court appearance today\nFifty six year old she's our say oc could spend decades behind bars if he's convicted Danny Rivera from member station WNPR in was in the courtroom and joined us from Miami Hi Danny\nHey I Know this a court appearance was largely procedural tell us what happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk I'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents\nTo illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti democratic pro Trump's an anti media stickers and he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bill because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community\nWhat was his demeanor\nSo before the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan jumpsuit\nHe didn't say much um but when he talked he did sound kind of defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all it was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield them from from the view once I started happening\nI'm the judge us in the series of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of nodded I mean he looked\nSomewhat defeated I Would say um [noise] and the\n... yeah and ...\nSorry about that um you you could see you could see he was upset at some point you know his face kind of turn red who's cheering up his upper lip was quivering um he he didn't look like he was doing too well\nAnd this was all taking place in southern Florida which is not where his trial is going to take place explained that\nYeah so the charges were actually filed in the southern district of New York um he was arrested in in my close to Miami so that's where the the original I'm hearing is taking place but she will at some point be taken up to to New York\nOr the U.S attorney there is the one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs\nWere mailed there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes\nUm the the trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon these cases tend to take years or even longer to go to to to trial if there's no the deal\nI'm In the meantime the next hearing the the judge said it's going to be on friday here in Miami so he'll beer here at least until then and at that point we'll learn whether he'll be recently released on bail\nOr if you're going to be transferred up to New York for for more hearings [noise]\nAll right that is Danny Rivera reporter with member station WFCR in in South Florida thanks very much Danny\nThanks for having me\nWe're going to take the next few minutes to remember to be eleven people killed at the tree of life synagogue on Saturday\nTwo brothers inseparable and devoted to their synagogue Cecil and David Rosenthal Cecil was fifty nine five years older than David the brothers live together in a community home in Pittsburgh run by achiever that's an organization that helps people with disabilities\nChris show ... is vice president of residential supports with achieve it and she joins me now via Skype to remember the Rosenthal brothers a crush of welcome and um and my condolences on your last I'm so sorry\n... appreciate that\nDescribe she so and David for me what were they like\nGay and these were larger than life\nOr tear down our ... ... people were selling trying going to the fabric of their lives to rock throwers or hell they would stop and talk ... every line and ...\nAnd I read that she had an official role he was a greeter at the synagogue\nStay still hot on the greeter at the sad that I Would refer to him as far back fitter to throw hell he was always ... how are you\nGay and that was a very reserves hers thing will finish that her letter today that he just opened up they were so close to their Farley David would call his mother every front or a guy like oh God how from work\nThey got up with a positive attitude how has your family\nYou do and what your day look like for it today blessings for you today and they threw parties for everything and in fact one time they had their bathrooms remodeled in their home and they wanted to throw a party for remodeling the bathroom\n[laughter] trying to imagine that one and and and then\nThere was a next door neighbor where they had their house remodeled and they were going to put it on the market and they went to the open house because they wanted to be a part of that\nYeah what kind of work today do you describe them coming home from work\nDavid Was working for good well and ... and see if there was about to start a job two days a week and a family oh\nBusiness has it taken a toll on your staff who worked with them and help them for for all these years\nYes soon runs them at such an early\nAge excuse me and they are such a vital part of their family our family so it is extremely difficult now\nI'm so sorry part of what also must be difficult is letting all your other clients all the other people who rely on achieve a no how are you talking them through this\n[noise] myself and other staff member went out yesterday to meet with house late so people who are down to offer them and explanation as best we can about the events of Saturday\nAnd to offer any support we are also going to offer people kind of a service where people can come and share their memories and their failings\nSo you're planning some kind of gathering within your organization to honor and remember them absolutely and it sounds like these are two brothers who like to party who would have appreciated that gesture and been right there in the mix\nI think that is exactly correct I think that our Saturday you could have counted them to be where they were\nThat's where they wanted to have been the best way that we can remember them an honor then is to know that they live their life well anybody\nYou talked to in ... near them they were well respected in their church and their family is absolutely fantastic and\nIt's one of the best situations that could ever be\n[noise] that's for sure with achiever talking about David in Cecil Rosenthal the brothers were killed
