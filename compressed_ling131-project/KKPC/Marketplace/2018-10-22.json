Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auction by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser aired Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here I'll say\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art well I think every couple of generations you have some\nIn that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel Just chomp where he literally took and then you're in on hanging on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability\nOf a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really I tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price that in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the quarter is the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it\nAnd given that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter than most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off\nAnd said this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale I don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare
