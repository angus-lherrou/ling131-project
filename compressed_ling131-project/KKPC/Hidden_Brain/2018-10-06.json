project\nI like to look back at it and say I didn't know that I knew how to do that and so we had done these live shows we did a red rock show with the video games live\nAnd then I also actually hired them to record two of my soundtracks I did a video game and movie here in ... flu my whole crew from LA and we'd we'd made it into a recording studio and hard to ... and so there's been a\nYou know

to do anything you want just out of curiosity what would you make and I I I fumble some answer of I've always wanted to make a show or a concert or something that's science and music together and he basically said great\n... the show features a young protagonists called the seeker she lives in a dark forest that's kind of terrifying to her but there's a campfire that offers some comfort Tony without giving too much away what can you tell us about the story line sure wrote\nOne of our very first conversation was about how do we capture what science feels like\nWe don't want electric people we don't want to do it at a like here's how black holes work and let's explain space time that we don't want to do that or we want to capture raw emotion and the way the human beings have been doing this for centuries is through storytelling\nA specifically through a tradition of storytelling that now we called the classic myth like the Joseph cambell hero's journey it's it's the same type of story time tradition that scene in the matrix Star Wars Alice in wonderland lord earns you name it\nSo we are telling a\nMythic story about this young girl and she's afraid of the dark\nShe's alone just like all of us in her life she for questions\nIt's out there and the darkness that it's not the dark that is terrifying to it it's what can be hiding in there that we can't see she's in a state\nWhere the three most terrifying words are I don't know and then on his fateful night as her campfires dying and dying and\nJust try to feed it and put stick to the end would and nothing's working and it it it seems to have a mind of its own in fact we have a little bit of a cast away Wilson thing going on I don't want to give too much away\nThe idea of an inanimate object that you can talk to yeah okay and that's not suggestive leak kind of talks back\nI in this night where she's been here for a long time and fires dying dying dying dying and she's at her wits and when out of the woods a man in a\nBunny suit just coming out of nowhere and he started warming hands up on to the little me your fire and offers her help if she's willing to go on a journey and take a big risk\nShe decides to go on that journey and what it kicks off is a whole series of encounters where she'll tangle with these larger than life characters all played by the same actor the really brilliant effervescent Troy Baker how did the real life scientists to weave into this Austin\n[noise] like I mentioned earlier the original conceit of the show was basically a purely science plus music concept and and you can almost think of that as a science variety our\nYou know we live in a world where people like Bill Nye and near the grass Tyson it become kind of pop culture icons as the inside baseball term for them as science communicators\nAnd I thought I've always loved those people I admire those people I've worked with some of those people professionally but what really excited me was the idea of hearing from the actual scientist themselves the people who we bring them out of the lab we bring them out of their observatories would bring them out of their various\nExperimental dens and say let's put you on a stage wasn't alive orchestra and just tell us about what you do and so the speaker will encounter a kind of existential question and then\nHas what we're framing as almost like a vision where the lights we'll all go crazy it'll get very colorful and then the scientist comes out with a big fan fares from the orchestra and then they perceived to tell us about their work in a very personalized sum autobiographical way\nIt took seven years to Saturn and then their teen years [noise]\nParticular measure went in and [noise]\nAnd oh wonders what we saw\nHow was it to work with a scientist so you've got a I'll just read at a rate here a professor of physics at Cal Tech this is Maria ... okay and then Carolyn ... who's well known here in Colorado a professor of planetary science at the University of Colorado\nAt Boulder and then Alex Roberts professor of anthropology and paleo past solid G yeah ancient diseases I guess how how was it to integrate them Tony\nYes so you're probably thinking right now like what okay you've got this mythic story going on your site is kind of like what I was that one show how about like what what's going on here and they're animated shorts by the way yeah there's we have an ad\nWe we uh we integrate animation and and lots of lightning design and we have a um an amazing robotic fire thing\nThat you'll just have to see to believe that that Tony built himself that I've I I I did build myself what I can say is that\nThis is a light in the void is cause most meets a Christmas carol\nOh OK cosmos so that's like the documentary series originally by Carl Sagan Carl Sagan and then re done by by Neil DeGrasse Tyson oh and then a Christmas carol in other words because of these operations yeah I mean it really sounds like this is
