Republicans and Democrats was was negligible now the Democrats are the ones who really made a big shift and went way to the left and have left the middle of the country are you know as\nFar behind I think you know that that's what we saw\nIn the election of Donald Trump is you know these people that nobody accounted for\nThese people that you know that no one\nThought you know in flyover country

Trump's says he's confident that Republicans will do well in the mid term elections before heading to a campaign rally in Florida tonight Trump also insisted that citizenship rights for U.S born babies of undocumented residents can be revoked\nI Believe you're going to have a simple voted to believe that fossil or by the first ballot dollars but it was ordered jak voted out I'd rather do your Dodgers that President\nFar behind I think in those two justices as well as justice is Thomas and Alito and probably the chief justice John Roberts I think you arguably have five votes\nTo overturn what's called Chevron deference which were first to a decision in the Nineteen eighties where the Supreme Court said that agencies like the EPA the securities and Exchange Commission or OSHA\nUm ought to be given a very wide berth in their decision making we the court should defer to those regulations and rulings I think you will see Chevron deference in great jeopardy\nOr their other priorities you think this new court will have\nI think it is possible that you'll see this court\nUm harking back to the days of the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen twenties when the court would strike down what we now regard as garden variety uncontroversial\nRegulation of the workplace and strike it down on First Amendment grounds on the grounds of so called economic\nLiberty people forget a but once upon a time at the turn of the century and for the next Thirty years the Supreme Court struck down minimum wage laws\nAnd maximum our laws or regulations concerning workplace safety they did so\nIn the name of economic liberty now eventually FDR proposed court packing and was loudly critical of the court and the court change gears in Nineteen thirty seven the famous switch in time that save nine and for\nThe last eight years the courts interest in liberty has largely focused on individual liberty and you've got decisions for example like Rosie wave on abortion but I think it is possible that you may see that pendulum swing back\nIf you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution we'll be right back after a short break ...\nThank you to leadership partner cloud rigid naturalist a significant investor in our community through their gift to CPR learned more about leadership partners on the individual giving page at CPR dot org\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself\nAt his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford the allegations of sexual assault and let it us justices who are already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices I've interviewed I've stayed in touch with them since the book has come out I guess I can offer two thoughts one leaving aside the specifics of Dr Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's response the justices\nCan stand seeing the court placed or in the mail room they they think it's bad for the court they think it's embarrassing and while they'll watch the hearings are on TV you know they have cable at the court they live in a marble temple but they can still watch TV and they hate it\nHaving said that I think part of the reaction this time was having a specific most of the justices no\nKavanaugh chief justice Roberts served briefly I think with cabin on the DC circuit in ... if not they live near each other in suburban Washington they belong to the same clubs eat at the same restaurants there are other piece and Elena Kagan\nJustice Kagan when she was dean at Harvard law school tired cabinet to ah come teach there so they all know Kavanaugh they knew know him far more than they knew Neil Gorsuch when he joined the court and they like Kavanaugh and they respect him there is a reason\nThat Kavanaugh was the leading so cold feet or judge in the country that is the judges who send their own law clerks up to the Supreme Court to then clerk for justice is Kavanaugh was the leader in the country incidentally I think second place was Merrick Garland\nStill on the federal appeals court in Washington and ... who of course was Obama's pick to succeed Scalia in two thousand sixteen\n[noise] so I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices\nIn the Supreme Court who have been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault and these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassment issues\nAnd it questions the credibility of the ... court because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're a bias or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal Z\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas to part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself or hurt herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll cabin uh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias\nBut you know his performance after Dr Ford testify talking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him in an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed huge true\nPartisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nYou know or the Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that Thomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February that lives in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts ... I think it helps to an end feeble\nCongress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act just because they know that the justices across the street will act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the hold and teach Trump and therefore\nPresidential campaign ... confided to a friend\nThat he was outraged by candidate Trump's attacks on Roberts Roberts in effect saying I've been a loyal Republican my whole life I worked in the Reagan Administration I helped the Bush campaign in Bush Gore how can anybody seriously question\nMy credentials I was struck by that that the chief justice of the United states would particularly care what the presidential candidate thought because long after that candidates gone weather is elected president or not ... chief justice Roberts will still be occupying the Senate seat of the marble temple and will be there for decades\nSince this is the era of the John Roberts court in two ways one is that he's the chief justice but also he is now considered to be the swing vote so he is really the most decisive factor in the court now right\nCorrect he will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as it is of the court it'll will truly be his court and he will have the potential for quote unquote greatness\nWhen he's demonstrated at his greatest moment on the court in the Obamacare ruling has he demonstrated it in any other moment\nNo [laughter] not really it may be on the margins of some rulings but the two important projects for this chief justice have been deregulating\nCampaign finance Citizens United and all that and removing\nA racial preferences from American Life whether it's in college admissions or a how the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty sixty five is applied and he firmly believes in the conservative agenda on those\nTwo issues if you look at what he's done in those areas don't confuse him\nFor a moderate he's not but I think he holds the potential\nTo apply the brakes and I think to the extent we see the court further placed into the males drum in coming years now that it's got five votes on a lot of issues I think you may see this chief justice take his views about the courts integrity and\nPlace them ahead of his own particular views on this or that issue\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that gutted the voting rights act\nAnd that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um two ... future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to the Supreme Court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous Zimmer arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nOr you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices but Congress passed a law\nAnd reopen the law uncontroversial e periodically why is it the court's role to override\nThat democratic preference why is it um that those who brought\nThe challenge against the voting rights act somehow you need to have their alleged writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts is a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on upholding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that he had to draft of his decision what was the differences between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted\nTo strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks to draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBy the second opinion that resulted in the ... being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because there were four justices on each side he knew\nHe was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions\nLooked like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts and otherwise the opinion just doesn't right\nAnd he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best\nSense of the word in a close case decided I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter\nTo strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\nIf you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution he's also the former legal

inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to come to the point is on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh wasn't originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture lest I say that not really understanding the difference between those two terms but um is Gorsuch are Kavanaugh\nAn originalist or ... or\nDo they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a a trope\nIs that if you look at the constitution and I've read mind a lot there is no cause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me based on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favor as a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents were senators I'm to use their own judgments as to what you mean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "01"}
