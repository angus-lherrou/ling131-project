{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "Mhm so in the in the Republican I'm Obamacare repeal plan that passed the house there were what Republicans claimed work protections for people with preexisting conditions\nOr industry groups advocacy groups Democrats lots of people basically looked at these productions and said these don't go nearly as far as Obamacare does if people lost insurance for a period of time those protections might go away\nIn other cases you might be able to get health insurance for that health insurance wouldn't actually cover your pre existing condition\nWhich would ... you know sort of eliminate the points\nSo really there's no one clear plan that's emerged Republicans do clearly wants to make the case that you can have these pre existing conditions protections without having Obamacare that's a line that you'll hear a lot\nUm Missouri senator or excuse me Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley who is one of the attorney generals who is suing the federal government over Obamacare and his running against McCaskill in Missouri\nHas said this quite a bit you don't need to have Obamacare to have the preexisting production could conditions but there is no consensus Republican plan on this Holly has floated a few ideas that different people have said\nFall short in different ways uh but that conservatives have supported inside yeah this this will get the job done\nIt really there is no consensus Republican plan there's been no attempt to develop one in either the Senate or the house or in any real way\nSo really the answer is that they don't necessarily have an answer but they do want to be able to say look we can protect free existing conditions without Obamacare without necessarily saying how that would actually get on while okay we've\nGot time I think for one more call and that is from Maggie in St Louis max thank you for calling into America on the line\n[noise] thanks for taking my call so health care is an issue for you in this election [noise] ah\nYeah and extreme line like type ... diabetic and uh I live in Missouri and yeah cash Charlie's kind of a\nTerrifying for me I'm more of the reasons I live back from Virginia ledge because I couldn't get\nHealth care not true employer in a state of Virginia Larry had a high risk pool that was put in for several years ago so now is that five hundred bucks a month at premium I could actually get coverage\nUm and yes yeah I mean pretty much encouraged by Medicare came in every job I get out when I retire all that was determined by the health care that they provide\nAn end the amount of coverage that gets ... and I don't I don't want to go back to that [laughter]\nI I I hear your bag and you are not alone in in that sentiment make thank you very much for calling in to America on the line\nI and that sort of brings into high relieve Kevin what you were talking about it when I asked the question what are the plans that Republicans have for the replace part um if they're successful in in getting rid of\nA overturning repealing the Affordable CARE Act and from ... from what you said that there are a lot of there are a lot of ideas but no consensus\nYeah there there is no consensus I mean the Republican plans to replace Obamacare have always been focused on lowering costs they haven't necessarily been ads focused on protecting access\nAnd those sort of two goals have always been in conflict throughout healthcare policy how do we ensure access and cover everyone including the very sick including the very poor\nWith outs also driving up costs for everyone else and that's sort of the the problem no one's been able to fix 'em Obamacare had a few provisions that were designed to curb costs\nSome of those provisions seem to be working some of them don't seem to have been working as well and that's really the central tension here and Republicans overtime clearly have emphasize more alluring overall health care costs\nBut yet that might mean that they're more vulnerable and the questions of access and on this particular question of protecting people with preexisting\nKevin let me ... let me ask you a a a left field let them build question since we're talking about Arizona we were talking about or a race to succeed Jeff Flake in the Senate real quickly are you hearing any rumblings on the ground among people in Arizona a about wanting Jeff Flake\nTwo primary President Trump\nOr I haven't particularly heard any here I'll be honest I haven't quite been asking\nThat is definitely a sentiment that you'll see in DC when I'm there there's a clearly a group of Republicans want someone to make a what they fully admit uh probably fruitless challenge for Trump in the primary well or whether that person is Jeff Flake or Ohio governor John Case like\nThat sentiments definitely out there right I haven't had certainly hurt anyone in\nOur and if you and if you haven't heard and Kevin is not being said seven

economist at grant Thornton in Chicago she says one reason many investors are so rattled this time is that the direction of stock market is so unpredictable\nAnd then um fourteen because that's when I moved to a new town as the brings in family does in the film and that felt\nLike where I was emotionally connected to a time in my life I wouldn't say that's officially when my parents separated I think there was actually previous to that there was some ins and outs in the relationship I'm\nSo for me that was like spiritually the right age to sort of put myself into the story\nAnother a kind of see him in the book is that this fourteen or sixteen year old boy is getting different narratives from his mother and his father as they're going through this turbulent period of their marriage and he has to decide who's right who to believe and\nUm that's really tricky when you love both your parents and they're telling a different stories about what your future is going to be like is that something that you relate to also\nAbsolutely and that actually you've now reminded me of probably the most exciting first hit I got on the book was this feeling of the mystery of who are parents are\nDo do do you know when you suddenly realize like they are past life without the problems are that they're real people you know in in sort of seeing them as whole people which means they're flawed people that was exciting to me I I sort of had to get to know Jerry Anne Janette better\nProbably as a means of understanding my own experience maybe being put in the middle as you say but especially Jeannette I was like this woman is so complicated the mysterious and\nAnd sexual yeah which is I think also really difficult for the teenager to deal it especially because she kind of include him in a direction that just\nYes and and I how I feel about that is this woman has probably been a good mother for fourteen years and the good wife\nAnd I think the dad has tried in in in his way and I think they've done their best in many ways but suddenly like one day the rug pulled out from under the charade is up and it's just like this kid is sort of being kicked out into the wild right you know it's like okay\nTime's up you this is welcome to the real\nWorld [noise] so you directly asked Richard Ford for rights to adapt his novel wildlife into a movie and he wrote back to you in a letter he wrote that\nIs included or at least ... erupted in the press kit free movie I'd like you to read that letter it's a great letter\nI'm grateful to you for your interest in my book but I should also say this in hopes of actually encouraging you my book as my book your picture were you to make it as your picture you we're moviemakers fidelity to my novel is a no great concern to me\nEstablished your own values means go read the book behind so it doesn't get in the way\nThanks reading that so was that liberating to read that like the writer of the book is saying do your thing I'm okay\nI could not have written something better myself that you wouldn't want somebody like that to say to you I I was shocked and moved it is an incredible but of wisdom and permission so considering how much I Meyer is writing in general and especially how much this book movement and how much it meant to me\nTo have that sense of permission was incredibly important\nWere there a line from the book that you wanted to make sure we're in the movie and there's no voice over so it all the lines are dial up\nThat's right so the book is first person and actually looking back on the event\nVery tempting to use voice over especially because the language is so beautiful we sort of set a challenge for ourselves immediately like let's try and not choose what let's see if we can do it without voiceover let's try to make this present tense and let's put it onto the experience of witnessing this through the boys are starting to eat in a childhood\nYou know what sort of be opening image and slowly peel back layers of this portrait so that was the goal\nAnd their lines that I felt like had to be in the film that probably are not now do do you know because\nIt just keeps growing and that's one of the most beautiful things I experience of making a first film\nIs the growth meaning writing the script and putting so much working at the script honestly for for a few years because you just as an actor believing that the foundation is kind of what we all stand from you know and and jump off of 'em\nAnd then suddenly bringing actors into it we're asking you questions\nWere bringing subjects that you might not have even thought of\nAn emotion passes through them and it fills out something and suddenly you don't need that line that you thought was the\nEssence of the film or something um you know in fact there is a line that's cut from the film then I think is really important which is more in the character named Moran Miller play by bill camp says to the kid Joe\nSometimes you have to do the wrong thing to prove that you're alive for me that line just balls me over when I read it um and I couldn't wait to put it in the film and then the edit room we didn't need it ... interesting\nNeed it kind of says that when I probably shouldn't even dream of say no [laughter]\nDo you have a lot more anxiety as a director than you do as an actor\n... it's such a different kind of anxiety tell me about them differently [noise] well\nThere's one a migraine and one of them I guess I don't I think that for me acting is just a bit more lonely because you do so much of the work on your own and when you arrive\nKind of hopefully full so speaking and then you're what you're seeing partners in your director and but\nDirecting is I'm so collaborative it's more like you know playing in an orchestra or something maybe you're you're one of them you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean arrogant and it was going to affect the job you're dumb\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any long time 'cause I'm quite used about somebody's always asking a question from here you have to make a million decision today\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Paul dino who you probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he's directed his first film at an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the movie's called wildlife too\nWill be back after a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Paul day no great actor who's films include there will be blood love and mercy Little Miss sunshine he's in a new Showtime series called escape at Dannemora\nAnd he directed his first feature film and it's called wildlife it's adapted from a Richard Ford novel at the same name\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and us here you're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they're discovering that there's oil there\nAnd um there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capitalist who comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonists and in in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church mhm so this is the scene where you're baptized seeing him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another ah oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nWe thought well what are you in a ... D Julian go and speak to him it's All right John nice\n\nDo a machine or [noise]\nYou come here\nAnd you wrote gorgeous and wealth but you have also brought your bad habits as a badge lighter you last year to after women and you have a band in your child\nUm carry through and the rest of your acting career and now in your first time directorial effort\n[noise] yeah Paul I think has a lot of love I think he loves his actors and his crew he has a an incredible eye for detail I think it's definitely been important for me um I've been wanting to have been a filmmaker for a long time to sing directors like this go to work\nMeaning to see them wait for the oil drip to be right even though time and money is you know burning\nI remember one time or in a costume fitting you know him noticing something in the stitching the tie that nobody else would have noticed you know I'm just sort of\nThe focus to care and the integrity and it's also important when you see somebody like him I'm able to enjoy their work and and have a moment of fun probably too but to absolutely loved working with him and and frankly many of the directors I've worked with in the common theme is really um hard work\nThat took about your film love and mercy and this is a story of Brian Wilson\nMost famous for for each portion of course for his solo albums and I'm In this film there's two versions of Brian Wilson is the version you apply when he's younger\nDuring the beach boys era and then the version later in life when he's having serious mental health issues\nAnd I'm probably more than that part of the play by donkey sat\nSo I Want to pay scene from love and mercy you've been in this scene writing a God only knows grates on and you play it for your father and your if your father who's played by bill camp in the movie is an abusive control freak he's various are carrying with his sons\nAnd I'm very hypercritical nothing's ever good enough for him and so you're playing the song for him while he's sitting and looking very tense and smoking his pipe to here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from loving Marcy\nI'm In\n\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over the in\nThe so rough I Know but it's getting there is right for cause was\nShe likes to mean it'll get better that the vocals will counterpoint the backing track real soulful\nSo you don't want my advice for my lovely and just tell me what you think it's usually\nI'm living on her own\n[laughter] we're still family\nAmazon Fire their own father don't stuff that argument again argue I say something and you argue but don't say anything\n\nForget what you don't like to solve I never said that I can tell\nJust say something I Would change the title the country's a tuna\nCalled God only knows and fifty five fifty or I Am that\nDid you close your eyes look I asked you to tell the United states [noise] if you close your eyes you can see place\nSomething's happening\nIt's like being blind but because you're blind you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of thing\nI don't know what you're talking about\nI close my eyes students here say [noise]\nI don't know maybe it could be something with the right arrangement where you live French horn on it and [noise] flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex key shifts\nFrankly if you really want to know I don't care for it\nTo wishy washy if you leave me why leave me life will go on why go on living it's not like a Beach Boys on your brothers are going to hate it ... it just suicide note didn't you just say it could be something with the right arrangement well I gave it another\nThought okay if you can't keep your voice down in my house\nSo that's my guess ... in a scene from love and mercy the full day no as brand Wilson and camp as his father Murray welfare and it's really upsetting seen I mean God only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that\nAnd that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's\nVery upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in a way it's\nThat approximate it ain't no brain loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I've seen you actually playing records\nYeah and that's ... that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just in the same\nYou used to be in a band called moved a new guitarist and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably have formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film of emergency\nListening to it ah is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally or personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly pet salads and smile\nI don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you get so much light in him and he met him yes yeah and when he when we talked about music you still felt like a school boy about it you know um you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really\nBut but by lightning signed him I mean you know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to give give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know\nUm it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he was offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd we found that totally I get it yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those courts like you'd you know how to play those courts let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd single doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly\nYou know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan his his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a gee you know she's often emphasizing a different um note that in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound or the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time um so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that\nI don't listen to them often because it really sends a chill through ... and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess is ... who is now also director Paul day no his directing debut is an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife and the movie is also called wildlife
