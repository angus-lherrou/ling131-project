D stabilizing\nUm nature of President Trump's field tea um or seeming affinity to ... strong men or two Russian President Vladimir prudent or to a Kim jung on of of North Korea\n[noise] well I think in that case um\nFor one thing in in a system built around alliances uh the way the American system is that actually has a lot easier to push around your allies than your adversaries because your allies are dependent on you the facts of the United states and Trump have been able to squeeze\nMarginally better deals out of Canada and Mexico and could probably squeeze a bed marginally better deals out of Europe too it was partly because those countries are entirely dependent on the United states and so we can use that leverage against them\nIn the case of adversaries they're not dependent on the United states and they actually can do was damage and I think that\nTrump in a way a is a classic kind of you know the phrase I Would use as a kind of bully tower he's tough with the people you can push around with and he's very deferential to the people who can hurt him so he looks at a guy like ... well setting aside whatever\nComplicated relationship ... may have with Russia in a general sense but who was a strong guy who can do\nDamage to us a Kim Jong alone is a strong guy who can fire missiles at us and so those people he's rather up see quiz ah to our allies he's a bully that so you know I think at a certain sense there's there's a logic to it but it's it's not a very sort of a I think a very attractive ...\n... you know the the um I I'm I'm thinking of uh of three things here I'm under normal circumstances of the president of the United states\nUm the United states would be forcefully out there on this um the stories about the um um the head of Interpol um and what the Chinese have done um our colleague a Washington Post a global opinions columnist or mouth ...\nAnd his disappearance a Russia poisoning um people in Great Britain with\nThese things be happening if there was a forceful voice coming out of the White House not only that only expressing condemnation from the United states but also standing on those principles that made the United states\nA shining example to other nations\n[noise] well I mean I don't want to pretend that nothing bad ever happened when the United states was playing his role in the world obviously bad things always happen but I think that you are identifying saw a a real trend here\nAnd the trend is that all kinds of bugs around the world are increasingly are believing that they can get away with doing things like this I think in the case of the the the Saudis I'm as it appears assassinating\nForeign germ or a Saudi journalist in a foreign\nCountry and sending out a hit seem to get him that would not happen unless they were pretty sure\nThat the United states wasn't going to do anything about it after all Saudi Arabia is entirely dependent on the United states for its defense and survival so they have to believe that they should that the Americans would do nothing a similarly for the things that we see Russia doing in terms of poisoning spies so there's this general sense\nA that it that everybody is sort of free to do what they want and there is no\nThere's no one in four seeing any kind of a fundamental decency in the international system I think there's no question that the increasing absence of the United states from that role is not only encouraging these actions but it was when courage more and more and in fact more serious kinds of actions in the in the years to come\nBy boat one were to answer your the name of your book as the jungle grows back if the United states um gets in a new president Democrat or Republican who um decides to stand up for the liberal um the liberal world order will it be too late\nTo beat back the jungle\nI think it depends when it happens that can have a point where it's too late I Want a steak of the first point is you've got to re educate the American people why it matters\nAll right Bob Kagan thank you very much for being on the show that's it for us tonight thank you to all of my guests join us tomorrow night trying again tomorrow and I remember you can tweet us at ...

Wednesday with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than three point one percent NPR's Jim Zarroli reports that the drop comes at a time of rising interest rates\nThe Dow is down steadily throughout the day and then plunged even further it lost eight hundred and thirty one points by the end of the training session investors pulled money out of high growth tech stocks such as Facebook Amazon and Microsoft and the NASDAQ Composite index fell more than four percent\nSeveral factors appear to be worrying investors one is the ongoing trade tensions between the United states and China\nAmong the day's big losers were Boeing and caterpillar which are big exporters another concern is the steady rise in government bond yields and the Federal Reserve's ongoing tightening of interest rates Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nFederal authorities have charged a New York man with building a two hundred pound bombs prosecutors say he planned to detonate the device on election day on the national mall in Washington\nAnd it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working just think about other things that could possibly go wrong um and I kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds there were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nAnd I think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nA and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet with Janet Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about this period in their life\nAnd just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to a family where you're trying to raise kids you know in Neal's case to you know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York it asked her the in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash including the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that the ... this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um after his space craft\nDocs with the fuel spacecraft in space the first time one space craft has docked with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything said do you like the the the spacecraft that he's got west\nThat's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control\nAnd he's just kind of spinning and tumbling and it's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes where you can just experience\nThe the and the extremes\nOf being I'm In space capsule and this case because it's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it's a terrible mistake right so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the Gemini mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have destroyed you know everyone kind of feeling like a like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick of fate\nThis problem you you described began and it's not just that it was a this you know can immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of cutting out to big wide shots that would\nThat would sort of overly explain things trying to really be subjective and immersive to what Neal himself and he and his and his colleague Dave Scott would experience than I think that was really important to us\nAnd that was just one of many instances of you know I guess what I'd qualify as you're near failures or in certain cases failures that led the way to the success story of the moon landing um um so I think trying to remind audiences how fragile this all was how dangerous\nOr the lives that almost cost in some cases the lives that did cos\nI'm you know I think it helps us appreciate maybe just just a how hard earned that final moonwalk really was\nMaybe in tradition here if you're just joining us my guess is Demian choose out and he directed the new movie first man that Neil Armstrong at an all a tip to be the first man to walk on the moon he also wrote and directed Lala land and whiplash we'll be right back this is ...\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Damien ... who directed the new movies\nOr a man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties in Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and ... also wrote and directed not our land and whip lash\nWhat did you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises you can viscerally experience it and\nTherefore portraying well\nWe tried to shoot and in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know some set of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same our production designer Nathan crowded and incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and we ... we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on a most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to ah and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had a kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and\nExtension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are and that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan ... isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and and Dave Scott you know ah [laughter] oh we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody for lap Horton question [laughter] ... not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was just getting ... from we we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no it got us actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't then\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space um injustice position with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life into a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and actually sitting down and facing them\nOr you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and flying into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think because we had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] um congestion her which did the score\nFor the film and you also worked with him on whiplash another land you met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um I Know music is very important\nTo you during the the moon landing sequence\nUm there's music that sounds to me like part military part like western theme music and you Star Trek referred to space has the final frontier [laughter]\nI don't actually intentional to have that kind of western edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military ... kind of galloping like horses in a western [noise]\nUh well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know could sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflecting Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kinda get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves to\nThe inner Homs is that when you are how\nHe ah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio or between the capsule and kept calm or and mission control and what not um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you can listen to all of it online and and uh\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh you know a everyone it come too far that point to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music why should we could get in to Neal's mind space if we can get into that sense of just a relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would be fit to see\nOK let's hear some of that music and his mom landing music\nFrom the score for first man [noise]\nX. men landing music from just inherently to score\nFirst man and new movie that Neil Armstrong and engineering space missions and\nLanding on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and ...\nThey're saying that your film is become controversial for in some circles as that you're getting show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera ...\nAn excerpt of the transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication\nCaller and this is from September fourth the interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown was asked do you think that's upsetting\nAnd Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked you think other people should go see the movie and ... says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about\nThe flag material the movie you know I think those\nAre pretty much exclusively among the people who had seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions of something like that or get aroused think are obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flags standing there on the moon on the lunar surface\nIn terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know in showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the rod into the into the litter soil and propping up at the flag a we made a choice entirely ... choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and
