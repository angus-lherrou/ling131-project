I think that they're ... yeah we can have a different discussion but anybody who starts and promised that that that it's both sides also the idea that there are\nYou know a representative number of people of color on the in the conservative giant and the liberal or progressive there ain't no not\nTrue I I Will tell you what I what I Would didn't resonate with me about this study is that nice but a lot of time on social media I spent a lot of time into watching MSNBC or were you know Fox News or CNN I spent a lot of time on Twitter and you see the intense anger that Americans have for one another and then you go out into the real world and meet people\nAnd you find out how people are not like that you people actually can have these conversations and when you do meet people face to face it is a lot easier than if you can just you know swipe them away hey I'm unfortunately we have to leave it there\nThanks to all of our guests tonight and thanks to all of you for listening joined us again tomorrow night I'll be back here again remember you can tweet us at hash tag eight O.

President Trump says the U.S is asking turkey for audio and video relating to a missing Saudi journalist Trump confirmed it during a brief Q A name with reporters\nAnd that was a big deal until the assistance or we have asked for it if it exists with them but I mean we've asked for it if it exists\nThe president on Wednesday repeated that Saudi Arabia is a major ally noting there's also an important customer for US military experts\nIn an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday Trump warned against a rush to judgment comparing condemnation of Saudi Arabia to the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nResidents in parts of Florida's panhandle are still waiting for power and cell phone service to return after hurricane Michael tour through the state's northern coast a week ago NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports some rural communities are just starting to receive relief services\nFEMA has been sending teams of search and rescue specialist like Adam sheets of Virginia task force one in Jackson County sheets them multiple trailers damage from the storm on the same property where a brick house still stands\nAnd this is all family role in that home right there's a poem that okay in order to get assistance from medically they have some medical issues\nHundreds of families are still sheltering in school buildings around the region and you along NPR News Jackson County Florida mine\nGordon drownings in the Mediterranean Sea have reached an all time high this year and as Joanna Kakissis reports from Athens the United nations warns against a rising tide of hostility\nThe un says the anti migrant rhetoric that's rising in Europe is toxic and divisive\nIn a statement the un high commissioner for refugees fill up a grandy said the anti migrant rhetoric is out of touch with reality fall asleep painting Europe as a place under siege by foreigners\nGrande called this scapegoating these are human lives he said\nMore than Seventeen hundred migrants have drowned so far this year mostly in the central Mediterranean they're trying to reach Italy where an anti refugee government has tried to ban all private humanitarian vessels rescuing migrants whose flimsy boats sink in this long in perilous stretches seat\nFor NPR News I'm Joanna Kakissis in Athens\nEuropean Union leaders are giving themselves several more weeks potentially until the end of the year to cleanse your friendly divorce with Britain before their separation brags that somewhat on Wednesday avoided any friction but also produced no tangible results\nAnd it means something and I like that\nWhile we're on the subject of cheesy um horsing around the show that project starred in had a theme song\nAnd not many TV shows have theme songs anymore that explain the premise of the show yeah and so I Love that that horse in Iran actually has a theme song explaining what the shows about so I thought we could listen to the theme song [noise]\n\nSo that's the theme song for the show within a show on Bo jak horsemen I'm so why did you want a theme song for horsing around\nWell you know like you said you don't hear theme songs are certainly not expose a tour theme song so much in this day and age but it does feel like a staple of those shows like the Brady Bunch of the perfect example of okay so you're just joining and here's the premise of the show this will be characters are this is how it works\nUm and it felt like a really fun\nWay and like I thought if you heard this song you would immediately know what kind of show dishes\n[noise] since bowed jak as a horse did you ever watch Mr Ed you're too young to have grown up with it but I'm was that an influence at all and he too\nLike the bow jak horsemen series within the serious horsing around he too had a theme song that kind of explained the premise of the show that he was a ... horse\nAre you know I have seen a little Mr Right it is slightly before my time but I think the the nature of being my age is that when I stayed home sick from school I didn't have cable so I Would just watch whatever was on TV which was often older rerun so I Do have\nA bit of pop culture knowledge outside of my own experience um and certainly part of the original pitch was what's Mr Ed like behind the scenes right what [laughter] when Mr Ed goes home after a few in my early and that was helpful way to go through\nAnd it's really funny if you're just joining us my guest is Rafi ... Blacksburg and he's the creator and show runner of Bo jak horsemen an animated comedy tragedy [laughter] that's both really funny and sometimes really really sad so we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise] Hi my name is ... and I'm a member of Colorado Public radio [noise]\nI don't have an unlimited budget for these types of donations and so I think the ability to withdraw smaller amount every month throughout the year with a better way for me to give more than I Would have been able to you in one lump sum now\nIt's easy to become an evergreen member just log onto CPR dot org and thanks [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is ... Blacksburg he's the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy drama series\nBow jak horsemen and um it's now\nIn season five ... five was recently released on Netflix when I first started watching bow jak I thought oh this is such a funny show about the tropes of popular culture and then like the deeper I got into it I thought like wow there's some really emotionally upsetting things that happen in this [noise]\nYou know voting is an alcoholic he's mean effects this has this ongoing monologue self destructive monologue in his head about how much she hates himself and how ... how much he knows he's always doing the wrong thing and so what he does is is drink more\nIntense things sometimes get like really dark and at the risk of I'm giving something away from an earlier season\nI'll say that Sarah Palin who is the actress who plays bow jak daughter adopted daughter ... sitcom horsing around um after she gets out of rehab years later and he invited her\nTo get high which he should never have done she just got out of rehab she ended up oh dean at you know toward the end of the episode and it's it's kind of shocking I mean you know it's a comedy it's animated but you really emotionally unprepared for that\nI think the the the pitch for the show you know what I went into Netflix was always votes going to start like your typical animated comedy and it's going to feel like as you're watching it like oh I get this I get what it is an over the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more\nAnd and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first\nYour thinking oh my God I care about these characters went went up and they they tricked me um and so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we've really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy uneven tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and it's bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness instead and some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and\nAnd jackets and such to spare afterwards and feel responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly guys off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in but maybe\nMinor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side and he's not trying to\nPaper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a note maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to launch for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia is birth mother comes to to she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be in a live your life again it of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya or they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway that we're supposed to water be careful\nLobes of the way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nThe network really juiced because they're ... for good\nReporters because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. L. to the guests stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do is just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings ... not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nBut I think middle school or high school me who is the butter those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that mean to me and I think I Am also guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always\nThinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in it can actually\nSure I can give a couple of examples you know I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes\nAnd I think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs passed it as I had convinced myself that we were and thought that we were and now some of those jokes\nIn the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I'm not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very boorish character and we had a a gag or he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive\nAnd uh they're going to Alaska and he has a line or about\nWhat we're going to Alaska or what am I going to say that it's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber monsters is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize and clearly the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke\nUm but someone tweeted at me a couple of years ago and said you know I Am a native Alaskan myself and I was watching your show\nAnd there is not a lot of representation for my people on television and to watch this show make this joke about my people and knowing that this was the only reference in the show of my people and knowing that nobody who works on the show is of my people it it hurts\nAnd I cannot then say no but you are wrong because I did it correctly I you you misinterpreted it so you are wrong to be offended I have to hear that note and go oh you're right maybe weren't as careful about that as we should have been\n[noise] I Know I Know some comic steals become actually very difficult to do comedy because there's always somebody calling you out for saying something politically incorrect so I'm Wondering how you've changed the right in on the show with this kind of sensitivity\nThat you feel you didn't have in the first season and that you're trying to have no\nWell I mean first of all who says comedy should be easy like why why do you get free like oh this is making this making my job harder yeah blue ... that's what happens in life\nSometimes there are challenges in your job or your career and you have to learn how to take them and I think it's a good thing and I think this means that more people are being hurt because I don't think\nAll of a sudden just because I saw that tweet I I don't think that means that people were not offended or hurt by my humor before it just means now I can see it and now I Am aware of it and I think that is a good thing\nAnd I think it is a challenge to to to challenge your own preconceived notions of what is okay or what is funny or who are you making your comedy for and I think if you're a comedian who doesn't care about that\nThen fine to make the comedy for the people that will not be offended and that will be your audience you know I\nWant to make comedy that that people who are perhaps disenfranchise or marginalized can't enjoy I don't want my comedy to exclude them so it's a challenge but I take on and it's sometimes hard to get that feedback and people say hey this really hurt me\nBecause my ego wants to say no it didn't you know because I Want to feel like no\nI I Am I Am smart I Am good I'm a good guy you don't understand I have good intentions but I I think hearing that really helps me and I I don't want to get to a place where I'm not hearing those notes or I feel like I don't have to hear those notes because I think it makes me a better more sensitive more interesting writer\nIf you're just joining us my guess is ...

the Netflix animated\nComedy tragedy he's\nA bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central\nSo watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter man who had a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so and mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto in the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah says\nHappy Halloween because it's missing and and so we have the the misfit toys or Hanukkah um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAre you now officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "18"}
