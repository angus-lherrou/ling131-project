have\nDescribed it as part of me wonders whether it's because it's in part it started out as a rural crisis and the rural communities particular like the rural media for example it's been has been hollowed out in the way that say local newspapers have been hollowed out and it just that is that part is it uh\nI Would say that's probably part of it I Would say to that that\nThat the people involved you know I'm a member of the medium or working in Puerto for many years and and ah and if you and if if the people who are most affected actively don't want to talk about it if the obituaries that they write our purposely\nI'm a obfuscating or actual fabrications if you can't find those people willing to talk\nIt is very difficult to to bring it to to light and that is really what is happening all across the district starts and starts in Appalachia the rust belt areas spread now of course I think really it is the biggest place you find it really is in the suburbs uh\nI'm a mostly white people I'd say Ninety five percent Ninety plus percent um bobbing white people but I Would say that there's a lot of those folks are just as some horror that they never imagined happening to their families on so\nUh they are very very willing to have been I Would say until until the last three years\n... um are unwilling to talk about it when you don't have people who are most affected I Know it was a media member of the media if you don't have those people most able to tell the poignant story you ... it's very hard to get traction on it and also if you don't have\nThe kind of a I covered the crack epidemic I was my first job as a reporter uh and journalism many years ago when the child Stockton a California I could tell you that you cannot avoid the crack epidemic not because so much with the drug\nAbove but because of the\n... the gang involvement to the drive by shootings of bullets so a crippling young young children um I mean that was it was impossible to avoid the crack epidemic in this one\nYou've seen overdoses sky rocket really as crime rates all across the country have really dropped precipitously and that's a that's also a new thing about this epidemic\nWhat your point about obituaries that's one of the other interesting stories this week it was a ... a an obituary about a young woman\nOr you know such a cliche went viral but it did in part because her family was so explicit about what happened to her and it was very much\nA cry of heart you know to people saying you know educate yourself about this just before you go let you know we have about a minute left I'd like to ask you as our culture got what would you like to see what would you like to see\nA as ... in in terms of how we address this issue for from the standpoint of our art because anytime you know the Hollywood or the artistic any take something on people always accused him of glamorizing it or not really telling it\nOn the other hand you know so what would you like to see in the minute we have left\nI mean I I think it's really interesting that the two shows that we perhaps most associate with depictions of the drug trade\nOr over our our say our generation a Breaking Bad is one and the wire is the other right and they're they're both shows that are incredible shows you know really great storytelling but the Breaking Bad almost has a sort of black it has black comics sort of satirical plans to it or that\nBrings a different energy to the the thought about you know what that crisis represents about the human beings within it and not about\nAn infrastructure system a phenomenon or something right I I feel like a lot of times we don't see that that more human individual perspective when you talk about you know drug issues in in communities I guess I'd like to see more of that more texture and more humanity\nThat shift Yankees uh CNN contributor and Wall Street journal online column is joining us from NPR West in Los Angeles Culver City

Panhandle tens of thousands of people are still without power NPR Shana than than reports\nMost of the outages are in Bay county and northern Florida near the border of Alabama and Georgia residents say they are using candles flashlights after dark and generators to power air conditioners most of Florida's electricity sources are outside areas most impacted by the storm and remain intact\nThe hurricane destroy transmission lines substations and utility poles connecting those sources to customers goals powers says as more than a thousand employees working on restoration and in the meantime authorities are warning residents to stay away from downed power lines\n[noise] one the one hand there are a lot of products on the market a credit products that has a PR below thirty six percent but as I said the typical payday loan customer or applicant has a credit score a that's five Seventeen it's in the low five hundreds\nOr they're not getting credit cards they're not getting installment loans they're not getting those the sub thirty six percent NPR loans and they're not going to get them a after this ballot initiative if it passes\nA now are these predatory loans I I think that um that's an interesting thing to talk about what does predatory mean usually in the payday loan market and there are a thirty four other states in the country that have pay the loans\nOr as as well as Colorado usually in the Hitler market we're looking at issues of ... or abuse with loans that are arguing full in just two weeks and they take more than one third of the customers next paycheck when they come do they have they PR is in the range of four hundred percent or higher\nOr they have pre payment penalties or other kinds of harmful practices\nThe loans and Colorado because of the two thousand ten law have none of those things so it's not clear to me what what is meant by a the term predatory loan in this case\nAnd this goes back a as I said to previous legislation that's been passed in Colorado [noise] uh and so it it sounds like other access to credit would be difficult to come by\n... as you say if the interest rate has kept in Colorado at thirty six percent a payday lenders will be out of the market uh but what do you base that claim on\nWell the as I say they're thirty five states in the country that have payday loan stores or Colorado is unique and its law\nOr the Fifteen states plus D.C that have the do not have payday loan stores how they effective MPR limits in the range of thirty six percent Idaho empirically there's not a state that has that kind of a PR limit and has a store is making a credit available\nOr like a payday loan or a small installment loan to people with this kind of credit score now\nEvery state in the country including Colorado has pawn shops and rent own stores\nWhich often cost a lot more than pay the loans every state in this country has consumers with checking accounts who have see based overdraft programs that charge a typically thirty five dollars every time somebody overdraft they're checking account but payday loan stores do not exist in states where there's an effective NPR Catholic thirty six percent\nOh All right so we can look to other states as a harbinger of perhaps of what might happen in Colorado if prop ... passes on the mid term valid\nI think it's important to follow the money and the biggest contributor to one eleven is a group called the sixteen thirty fund which is based in North Carolina and fights for among other things to tax fairness transparency in government and access to health care\nAnd local donors this is interesting I include the mile high United Way I Want to say that we reached out to multiple payday lenders and none would do an interview on prop one eleven but not surprisingly we can say they oppose this measure [noise]\nIs it possible that if pay the loans aren't available in Colorado that people might be a forced into more dangerous situations I mean I I don't know I don't want to paint too bleak picture but like loan sharks is that a possibility or a the idea of even physical harm or something like that\nYou know the the loan shark thing comes up often there's no evidence of it OK I'm\nEvery now and then you will hear somebody tell a story of how they know somebody who hangs up by a check cashing shop and they'll make a few hundred dollars available and small loans to people informally um but on a on a widespread basis it just doesn't happen and and that that's for a lot of reasons but I can tell you one big reason it doesn't happen as\nPeople who use pay the loans are generally just kind of mainstream ordinary people they want to use legal stores they don't want to go to alleyways and get cash\nThey're looking for a place that has a sign a storefront customer service some sense of protection from state law they don't go to um a loan sharks by and large\nBut um you know what they do do is they look at the other options on the table and some of them will overdraft more some of them will go to a pawn shops more rent or own shops ... some of them\nWon't borrow as much but um I can tell you that in in Colorado with the current pay the loans they're small installment loans everybody has a minimum repayment term of six months a the a PR and the cost of the overall cost is about four times lower than any other payday loan state\nAnd so there are a lot of protections yeah the question hammering when we've already consumers asserting that I'm going to have to wrap it up but I think that the fundamental question facing voters is whether Colorado law has gone far enough or if they think it needs to go\nFurther I'm grateful for your time thank you Nick ... director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable trusts in Washington DC and to reiterate neither he nor to take a position on prop one eleven in Colorado the measure would cap interest rates on payday loans it's thirty six percent\nAnd they'll note again that payday lenders we contacted were unwilling to speak\n[noise]\nVoters in several suburban Denver counties could have a big say over which political party will run state government these

next story exposes a little known aspect of slavery let's say that some listeners may find disturbing Denver poet dominate Christina gives voice to end in slave to black woman who in the Eighteen hundreds\nEndured medical experiments\nProcedures performed by a white doctor considered to be the father of modern gynecology\nChristine as new poetry collection is an orca speaks a history in poems and welcome to Colorado matters thank you for having me you right in the voices of both an arc of the enslaved woman and Dr Jay Marion Sims the white doctor who experimented on her [noise]\nUh let's start with a poem written from Sims perspective Dr Sims makes something new that just set it up for us what is the new thing\nThis was really when he was at the precursor of inventing what would become the modern day speculation which is used today for pap smears and you know ... a logical exams\nAnd this grew out of his work some would say torture slaves correct okay so let me have you read this\nDoctor sends make something new what should happen most always is invention\nThere is no wider mystery in the universe than that of woman what salt and bone she's got she is a composition of ... thought a borrowed read if you know your Bible she is so easily just assembled\nI take the ruins stock of ease the wilted pedals the spent flash and bring it wire steel restoration\nEverything we delight in came first by the blood of a woman\nAnd then and then iron and what men do after\nIt is well documented that seems experimented on female slaves as part of his gun a logical research correct [noise] what did these women endured during and after the experiments that poem really gives you the sense that there's a dehumanizing going on here\nRight and of course you know the the institution of slavery was already participating in that dehumanization and the modification of bodies so for me it's it's about doctors then sort of\nGlacial this inclination toward his subjects they were just subjects they were not human beings they were not afforded the rights or the proper considerations that you would you know offer to a human being or someone that you respected or valued or emphasized with\nAnd fundamentally what he was trying to do because there was sort of a stigma attached to treating women I'm particularly guy like logically so he was trying to figure out a way to repair damages that were done during labor and delivery traumas specifically the ethical ... you know\nStill it tears um and so he cornered these enslaved women in this makeshift hospital behind his house in Alabama and experimented on them with the intent of perfecting that procedure and then offering it to white women and he did so without anesthesia anesthesia without\nAnesthesia right there was a belief I've read that a black people could not feel pain right that was part of correct what was in his eye cuts to the point\nThat is right that was the prevailing sort of ideology at the time that black people did not record pain in the body the same way that others did and so it was fundamentally a way to justify brutality\nAnd so for these slaves for the people he was experimenting on this would have been incredibly painful of course on for a long time of course yes ... ... what did you ever have been beneficial to them yeah\nIt's my understanding that he did repair some of these terrorists to the women um I think for me it's about\nProcedure um they were tortured and there was a ton of blood letting before repair was done right and so there was still no real regard for their humanity or their person HUD yes he fix certain injuries but he created others I have\nBeen hunted since reading your collection I mean just just so haunted by this history I Wonder how it affected you when you first learned about an hour 'cause story and let's be clear that an orca is a a was a real life person\nAbsolutely um I found her by accident I'm In etymology so I went looking for the etymology of the word anarchy and I found this name than ash tricks Antarctica\nAnd needed to try to track her down and it was clear that she was only the only language that was being curated for her\nWas as a means to talk about the doctor Jay Marion Sims and I was appalled by that then that would be the ... that's right in his story that's right but not the other way around that's right and so for me it was about trying to leave enough room for her\nTo be able to speak and tell her story and and move as much of myself and my own projections out of the way which is really hard to do um but I think are really necessary thing to do if you're going to attempt to press on a ... you\nAre listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan Warner and we're speaking with the Denver poet Dominique Christina and she has a new collection of poetry called a ... speaks a history in poems\nAnd it should shreds lied on some pretty terrible history or that on top of inflaming people in the United states slaves were also subjected to medical experiments and\nAh I I think what's what's so painful and so complicated here is that much of the science the medical practice today is based on the left right\nThat's right isn't that complicated yes speak to speak to that for me as a woman you know and it does it creates a tremendous complication for me I I recognize that\nThere is always a balancing act that is required when we talk about what we are the beneficiaries of in our present day realities\nWe have to at some point interrogate how we got here and often times there was torture or pain or wounding or bruising in the back of it\nAnd so it does create a complication\nFundamentally for me though and aka is not singular\nThere's still a very important an urgent conversation around women today who do not have authorship over their bodies particularly during labor and delivery you're still being prescribed and dictated to in the hospital room\nIt was very important to me that in this conversation we hear you use a ... voice of the collection and it's frankly the voice that I had like towards the end of the Congress issue we're left with her words would you read a poem called no magic no how yes\nNo magic know how that's when I take down my own dumb heart right there\nWhen method that to say a mule what a few more mild left to slavery stopped by the water on his way to someplace right there right there when massive Dr look right passed away I hurt to say she it's helpful gal can take a mighty licking\nRight there right there I scoop out the little bit of a woman
