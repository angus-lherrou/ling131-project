for Holt International children's services which was\nIn Nineteen fifty six and it's the same agency that our parents used to adopt her almost Thirty years ago\nI Am a Korean adoptee and I work in the post adoption services department of the agency a it's a brand new position it's really kind of a new innovative direction that we're moving to include adoptees in programming for adoptees what\nHave you done specifically to\nYou know address these issues that you're talking about these issues that adoptees and brought up to us is feeling isolated feeling like they never had a real chance to get in touch with their birth culture or what have you been doing in your job to make\nThese adoptees feel like they're not isolated and they do have a connection to where they are from\nI think what I've actually seen sharing is that it's not I think that there is this assumption that the longing for birth culture but a lot of the times it's a longing for like deep connection to people that are like you\nSo I think that that happens in a couple of ways do the work that um I've done\nOne is that we have adopted camp they started out as heritage camps that focused on Korean culture [noise] um but the realization happened that their adoptees from all over the world now in the U.S\nAnd so uh we do something called cabin talks that are the topic of the day and I remember the first year that I was accounts where we're sitting around and there is domestic adoptees and there was adopted from China Korea\nEthiopia and we're all sitting around and everyone was just sharing their birth story\nAnd for us first stories are pretty traumatic stories you know for one girl it's like all I Know about my birthday is I was abandoned in front of a government building in China\nLike that's extremely traumatic if that's your first known existence but what was amazing about sending circle is we went around the circle and everyone shared something pretty similar to that and so in hearing the stories\nThat adopt he knows that she's not alone in that grief\nThese adoptees who I'm assuming are all youth right that are going to just camp okay yeah nine to Seventeen they are just so hungry for a place where there are other kids who are the exact situation that they can and that all almost in in of itself and that is their identity which I feel like we don't talk about yeah I agree\nI Would actually at a conference it was like the Korean adoptees as Chicago to his annual conference but that was the first time in twenty nine years that I've ever sat in a room of entirely Korean adult adoptees\nAnd it was extremely emotional and I just remember um\nDuring the closing ceremony one of the adult adoptees was on the stage and they made a remark that you know you guys are my homeland\nAnd I think that that really hit ten skiing deep inside of me because it is just like we kind of feel or we can have that feeling like we're not really Korean for all intents and purposes and we're always recognized as a foreigner\nIn the state so whereas whereas our homeland as adoptees and for a lot of adult adoptees I think they might not in each other\n[noise]\nThat's Caitlin how

I don't know I\nKnow it it does it does make sense I'm interested in how and how you answer this question William about as the president says as being a very scary time for young men and I'll just interject the the count as a at least twenty two women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct dating back to the seventies but go ahead or William\nYeah I think there are thought reaction that should be afraid it's\nBest to a certain point\nBut I can understand how they have certain men could be scared and those certain men probably should be scared because they're also probably perpetrators\n'cause yeah we we know statistically as you said that the false reports of sexual or like so so low and jumping and other people are just kind of made it seem that hundreds of thousands of men are being falsely accused like every second of every day\n[noise] I Wonder if you are as we wrap up here you might give us two or three action items men can take to make the culture for women safer\nI Do think humility as one of the\nKey values that the man who go to the program and walk away with so an action item related to that is to be humble and listening to women and transgender folks about their stories and it is incredibly easy to access stories now because we\nWe as his men had been given this enormous gift that isn't me too movement\nI Wonder if you struggle with your own fear is that this could just become one more example of sort of men is the Knight in shining armor you know rescuing the damsel in distress is there something fundamentally about this conversation\nThat implies in any way that you know women can't help themselves\nI think that's a great question and I think that's why one of the leading\nSort of values that I think about his humility because if you approach engaging in gender based violence conversations with the angle of humility it's really difficult to get into the I'm going to be the Knight in shining armor armor here so once you begin to understand fully the roles of men and addressing patriarchy and sexual violence\nYou start to see that there is absolutely an avenue for us to engage where we're not saving the

designed to make redistricting more fair\nAmendments y and Z political boundaries and what's at stake with them or the focus of ... this time here is host San brash\nGerrymandering has become one of the dirtiest words in American politics it's when people draw congressional or legislative districts to benefit somebody off in themselves and it takes the blame for a wide range of problems with our democracy rigged elections voiceless minorities partisan polarization\nAnd no shortage of hurt feelings\nMy experience on the reinforcement commission was um it was probably the most uh discouraging experience I've ever had in politics [noise]\nThis is Rob ... wearing a former Republican state lawmaker\nIs relevant to this topic I served on the reapportionment commission which draws a state legislator mines and two thousand women\nJust commission formed after the twenty times fences job was to draw the boundaries of each legislative district to outline the voters would be served by each Colorado State senator and representative\nWas the beginning of the commission on the very first day that we met I read a letter into the record and I asked the other ten commissioners let's do it differently this time\nWe were said let's not decide on maps with a simple majority we should all be able to agree here\nAt the end of the day my my plea and my hope was do we pass them have to get both Republican votes in democratic votes and it would be a consensus outcome that approach was not accepted by either party I was asked what was the reaction when you read that letter and I think that the probably the most descriptive word is crickets [noise]\nAt that point it becomes a part of the process so I Do fault of their being a Republican member of the commission and\nWhat does that mean like what were you advocating for when it came to you know fighting for Republican interest on this mission\nI mean the partisans on the on the commission their job is is I mean just to put it bluntly used to draw a map that's going to let the most members and their party possible I mean that's really what this comes down to it is purely a play for power and whichever party has the most votes is going to draw the most favorable map\n[noise]\n... where he says that's what happened to Democrats admitted maps at the last minute after what he thought was the final deadline dozens\nAfter months of process big scandal Denver Post reported on it didn't matter the next day we had a vote\nIn the single independent on the panel voted with the Democrats to approve the map right away it was seen as a Republican live the new boundaries knocked out from the European come in and it created more competitive seats where Democrats had a shot of winning\nOr do you want to live in a district where maybe there are a lot of very different kinds of communities in it but your Congress person the fight for their job every couple of years and maybe somebody else knew is going to come take it if they can represent your district better\n[noise] you're listening to ... from CPR news when we come back Sam will look at amendments y and Z and how they're supposed to balance the tug of war between

I'm I'm a resident of Grand Junction Colorado and the Democrat served with Robert Mueller and the\nState house we're just getting together because we wanted to catch up on\nWhat each of us was doing she doesn't remember what you ate\nI've probably probably had a salad I've probably been undercut that was a side of the fries [laughter]\nI'm pretty sure I had the salmon Caesar [noise] um and we got we got to discussing a politics where I was doing ... policy and we'd redistricting came up I think there was just a a unanimous feeling around the table\nWhy can't this get fixed everybody sees what's wrong with it it's just patently obvious that this is a broken system\nHow come it hasn't been fixed until now and and you\nKnow we're all legislators were used to serve in the legislature so it's very easy to say you know it isn't as good as when we were there [laughter] and and how do we make it better for us but we ... we kind of agreed on five six seven principles that would be involved in doing this right and\nIt was these principles that formed the backbone of what's now y and Z and they have to overarching goals you prevent partisan gerrymandering and striking a balance between keeping communities together and encouraging competition so first idea to do that\nThe commissions are to have\nEqual representations from an affiliate\nIn other words the panel should have the same number of Democrats or Republicans and unaffiliated voters but\nWe also believe that the decision making should be done by a super majority\nSo that you just don't have one person who's vote swings the outcome\nThe idea was to require a bipartisan compromise and they decided that compromise should be struck in public not some back board room with a bunch of well paid politicos\nThis entire process should be subject to open meetings and open records and as transparent as possible there should be neutral criteria that don't favor either party\nThat means the district should have to conform to city and county lines wherever possible and they should be compact not weird quickly shapes that don't make any sense and if the commissioners managed to meet those goals\nThese commissions should promote the maximum number of competitive ... from\nThe first respect communities and then whenever possible draw competitive districts\nThis group of former lawmakers walked out with a plan it was by no means an easy route onto the ballot\nThe state Supreme Court shut down at first attempt in twenty sixteen and this year they had to merge it with competing redistricting proposal from a coalition of progressive groups finally last may the state legislature referred y and Z to the ballot\nIn Colorado at its best and I think we've got in front of us said Colorado solution that will soon be a model across the country\nAnd they did it in a pretty surprising way they voted unanimously to get out of the redistricting ...\nWho really wants to stand in front of their constituents\nAnd some say I support the status quo where uh the partisans draw the maps and where you voter are completely taken out of the equation\n[noise] and you mentioned earlier that you have no doubt that if this passes there will be political operatives were plotting to find some you know little way to get an edge do you see any vulnerabilities in the plant\n'em well if I did I'm not going to advertise to invite the operative to game the system but there's the old saying that if you build a better mouse trap the mice get smart [noise]\nOkay so Rob ... where it might not be willing to speculate about how somebody could steal the cheese from his proposed newer fancier mouse trap but I can [noise]\nTell me do it we're going to turn now to Amanda ... dollars she's the executive director of Colorado common cause to nonpartisan group that supports voter access and trying to make government as representative as possible and it helped craft amendments y and Z\nSo for our conversation I'm going to be the sneaky political operative and look for ways to to gain a partisan it sounds good sounds guys he looked like every\nPolitical operative I now really at all just tell you when I play monopoly like I'm ruthless I'd money under the board I read the bank I on mortgage properties I make trades based on future incomes I'll take kickbacks like\nI'm not a political operative but in another life maybe\nSo my big fat for how to cheat your is your system\nIs to get the right people on the commission people who are my people who I can trust us or my interest in my party so walk me through it or how does this work\nOkay so we're trying to get to four four and four four Democrats four Republicans weren't affiliated butter correct twelve twelve people in our condition the first task is there's an application and now just to all of Colorado anybody can apply to\nEven you could fulfill your dream of being on a redistricting commission there are some requirements you can't be a lobbyist for an elected official or have worked for a political party then you get a survivor random lottery\nBecause in California and they had\nOver thirty thousand applicants so we're just trying to ensure in case something like that how we get that much interest in Colorado that they're sort of manageable poor this was going to be like people you know signing up to go to Hamilton or something right\nHigh stakes after that I cannot three retired judges then evaluate those pools for what's called initiated community criteria are you part of your neighborhood association your PTA whenever we want people who\nLive in a hot a whole don't know anything about the state right next six of the commissioners would be a pointed at random the other six would be appointed by that same group of retired judges with some advice from legislative leaders and they're going to do that with a woman for the diversity and they said that the commission hopefully\nLooks pretty similar to the state of color [noise] okay I I mean as\nThe sticky political operative here I mean\nIs this complicated just to like confused me is that the purpose is\nNot going to say that we're trying to confuse you but we're definitely trying to work because they have to get through a couple of different stages of both random chance and nonpartisan selection it should be pretty difficult to hand picked someone\nThe this commission its its records would be open to the public right crack when the hearings would be open to the public they would and they have to be held throughout the state okay\nThat sounds great for me because if it's a public hearing I could just get on my political operative buddies together and I could be like go pose as a member of the public go to this commission advocate or criticize the map based on our ... meetings and maybe you can influence some of the commissioners", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "13"}
