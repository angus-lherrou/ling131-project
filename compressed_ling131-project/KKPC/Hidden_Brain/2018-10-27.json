children\nAnd they should not be required to exchange their privacy for the safety of a very few\n[noise] it seems that a law might be narrowly tailored to those parents who withdraw their children

yeah\nYou know most of them are this is a jail not a president and the prisons run by the state department of corrections and presidents are mostly where convicted felons or serving out there and says a longer sentences you know ... years and\nJails are run by county sheriff's and people who are in jail or either pre trial they haven't been convicted of anything they're just sitting there and he kept post a bond\nOr they're serving shorter sentences for misdemeanors both of those categories of people if you're serving time for a misdemeanor or your pre trial hasn't been convicted of anything you can definitely vote in Colorado\nAnd did most of the people in this jail realize that did they know that they would have the opportunity to vote this year\nNo and that was the big point of this

I mean during the time and stuff\nAnd how did they ever be able to register to vote unless someone brought their voter registration to down I mean there ...\nPoints to remember did you see

right to vote includes felons we continue now with ... the political podcast from CPR\nHosts sand brash looks at what could be next in Colorado When it comes to inmates and elections\nThe bill we're talking about this episode the one that gets parolees in Colorado the chance to pre registered to vote\nIt has a redemption story of a tone it died and was resurrected and that's not something that happens very often at the Capitol let me explain Senate bill one fifty ran into trouble and it's very first committee hearing had Republican and democratic sponsors\nBut Republicans on the panel they weren't so sure about it\nIf someone is a\nAnd really wants to know it should be their responsibility\nAt first the bill died on a party line vote with Republicans and opposition\nAnd the ski fails\nThen a day later one of those Republicans decided to revive and\nAs soon as you\nSay that I'm sure I Know he has some discussion yesterday and haven't voted on the prevailing side of that of a one fifty I Move for immediate and a reconsideration\nThe change of heart came from state senator Owen held a Republican from Colorado Springs\nSometimes you have to have the humility to admit that you don't make the right vote in Mary that humility with the courage to change your vote I guess we won't parolees to become productive members of our society\nAnd we would be foolish to diet and the chance to prepare for the responsibility the constitution very clearly gets them [noise]\nIn other states like Florida and Virginia the voting rights of ex felons has become a brutally part is an issue\nBut in Colorado it has its share of Republican champions not just hill secretary of state Wayne Williams is also a Republican and he lobbied for this bill his office has also moved to make it easier for jail inmates to but\nI certainly believe in\nThe opportunity to to serve your time and then go forward or to repent and change a and you know I think that's what most of us hope uh we do a as we make mistakes as what we should hope for others [noise]\nPer Williams some of this has to do with his Mormon faith\nCertainly that shapes my values and um you know as we work to garner support for it from folks that might not normally be opposed we didn't talk about the ability of that redemption that ability to come back to the phones\n[noise]\nRedemption was also an important idea for state senator Kevin ... Republican from Loveland he co sponsored the bill that passed the state legislature earlier this year it was actually one of his last accomplishments has a lawmaker he's term limited and won't be back at the start of the next session but so can I say senator Lautenberg ... that I can still say that\nRight up until the next to the to the next assembly is actually seated and\nUnique I connected with one bird from his home duty I'm In and out to all Colorado lawmakers if you want some good will with radio reporters have a home studio\nI Believe that anybody who goes to the prison system has a lot of strikes against them coming out of the system and I mean we loaded up with ... with so many barriers to bringing people back into being functioning citizens\nLicenses that you cannot obtain if you have a\nFelony on your record for example or hiring obstacles as well yes I Believe in personal responsibility but I don't believe the government should be putting on a national obstacles for that individual to get back into society\nThis is not a big element of that but it is a component to put people back on their feet [noise]\nWhat do you hope that this says to someone and they're getting out of prison when they meet with their parole officer and they her about\nPre registration say and regaining the right to vote what do you hope that says to someone who would soon be completing a criminal sentence\nOr two things come to my mind one I use the term redemption which I think it helps them recognized that they have paid their debt\nSecondly however you should give them that sense of responsibility which is essential for us to you know do the right thing when we are living in this uh this this land to freedom\n... what do you mean by that it gives the former prisoner that some response\nYeah it's it's one of those components a of a living a good life if you will to to understand that you have a responsibility to look after the interests of everyone through your voting privileges or or a rights\nAnd it's it's not everything but it is one component\nFor giving people the proper motivation to do the right thing in their lives I you know again I don't think it's the it's the cure all but I Believe it's a it's the right\nStatement that we make to that person coming out of the prison system okay you're done you're now citizen again and we're going to help you get back on your feet by helping you I'm a registered to vote\nHow have you talked about this bill with other members of your party I mean have you said the same things we've been talking about about redemption\nCNN and and making sure that people understand rights that currently exist what have you said to get them on your side\nWell to me and important component is\nThat to this is not a first step towards giving a convicted felon in prison voting\nRights because in Colorado if you're convicted of a felony while you're serving your sentence and that means either in prison or on parole you do not have the voting rights of a citizen that is a part of your penalty for having committed a felony the state of Colorado\nI Believe that that's inappropriate points\nThat should be kept in place and if if we wanted to change that I think we need to put it within the whole context of okay we are now reducing the penalty for every crime in the state of Colorado is that really what were intending to do here\nThere are again only two states that never remove someone's voting rights after a criminal conviction in Maine and Vermont people in prison on a felony charge can vote Justin Cooper the activists from the top of this episode wants to see Colorado move in that direction\nColorado as an opportunity to lean towards that full Rand franchise men I'm a restoration of all rights right as it relates to voting we'll see we'll ... we'll hope to get there I think it's an opportunity for Colorado I'm to be a leader in that in that sense disliked Vermont writer Maine\nWhich means this truth this moment of bipartisan ... around felon voting rights to be a fleeting thing in Colorado so far it's focused on helping people understand when they regained their voting rights a future fight could be about something much bigger\nWhether they should ever lose that right in the first place\nCPR San brash on the effort to make sure everyone who can vote gets the chance to next time Sam explores vote arrogant voting security to make sure ballots get counted and that hackers\nAre kept at bay you can subscribe to ... wherever you get your podcasts and you can hear it Mondays through
