wounded including for law enforcement officers after suspected gunman Robert Bauer soap and\nI er at the tree of life synagogue during the ceremony this morning authorities say the forty six year old is hospitalized and fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds FBI Director in charge Bob Jones says the suspects full mode of isn't clear\nThe actions this person took today for a couple were in the

as NPR's hammer Keith reports Trump says it's an act of anti Semitism\nIn prepared remarks President Trump said it was a wicked active mass murder pure evil and unimaginable adding you wouldn't think such anti Semitism would be possible in this day and age\nViolate filled boys of anti Semitism must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears there was no tolerance for into

does start to treat those with whom they have differences with a little more compassion and respect David Schaper NPR News Fort Lauderdale\nAs we heard Cesar say I allegedly sent pipe bombs to individuals and a news organization CNN that President Trump frequently criticized last night though the president bristled at suggestions that his rhetoric is to blame for what he called the sinister actions of one individual\nBut we want to if it's fair to ask if his tone has created a climate conducive to violence like the mail bombs or the carnage at a synagogue today I talked about this with professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson an expert on political discourse at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of communication we talking about the ...\nPlenty of critics that President Trump has normalized and quote unquote other ring of people attacks on political opponents as enemies\nThe president the United states has a unique capacity to determine what are accepted political norms of discourse\nAnd to the extent that expands those outside the normal boundaries he says to everyone else those expanded boundaries are now Andres in which you can not only speak but speaking public and not be afraid of sanctions and for that we have to hold Donald Trump accountable\nI mentioned you that we've been traveling around a state of this week meeting with all kinds of people I spoke with a group of Trump supporters were going to hear from them a later this weekend\nThey professor not to have heard any of the president's attacks on individual the media I you know I was asking him about the tone that the president sets but they professor not to have heard any of that\nWe all live to some extent within our own like minded communities and when we live inside our own media bubble were far more likely to see the world through the filter that it offers so to the extent that the president is saying things that have been normalized inside that constituency they're not going to remember it specifically it's going to be a background assumption\nThere have been any device of moments in American history of any violent moment I mean assassination politically motivated bombings the civil war for that matter how old are you can ... the era as a person who studied communication throughout our history\nThe difference between then and now is that now exist in an environment in which these horrific acts that is bombs were sent to two people yielded two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not\nWhether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them but it suggests we've lost our capacity be horrified by the sort of action we've lost our ability to say whether they were Democrats or Republicans we disapprove of this action profoundly\nAnd we're going to ask is the climate that is conducive to it something that we aren't any way contributing to for example when someone's driving around with a van with pictures that suggest ... member him at the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun\nThat that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then I tend to rally in park that than go to a rally where some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T shirts how we manage to normalize that so much that in this moment we couldn't come together and say\nWhoever did this this is highly problematic we disapprove of it and we are going to look at the broader culture and ask how we minimize the likelihood that will ever happen again\nThat is Kathleen Hall Jamieson professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for communication her latest book is cyber war how Russian hackers ... helped

we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nWe decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought what secure the White House for them and all of the states went for Trump on election night now though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house\nSo we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them watch and they're on what's on their minds this election year and help us understand but we've been hearing we ask WHYY states Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered us pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state me and for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shaped and general acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even fiber Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year in a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nPain they may have felt that you and I couldn't fathom\nThat all that's how they approach problems and we put all that together and it always allowed us to get one step ahead of that criminal by pulling everybody's unique perspective together and that's essentially what the problem solvers ... says it's a legislator version of that\nAnd I tell everybody I mean if you ever had a chance to sit on a one of those meetings you'll be so proud of your country because you out of the guy cannot tell who the Democrats or Republicans are that room you know when I leave Congress whatever that is are under whatever circumstances that is I just want to be able to say\nThat I I did my part when I was there to advance that belief that we got to get rid of this judging people based on what box they checked on their voter registration form when they're Eighteen we got to get past that\nCongressman Cedric thanks so much for for talking to us today\nThank you and WHYY stave Davies is still with us for a couple more seconds ... congressman fitzpatrick almost went to ... took pains to identify more as a member of the No Labels group or the problem solvers conscious than he did with the Republican Party what do you make of that\nHe has a case to make that he's an independent who voted against the repeal of Obamacare he's gotten support support from gun control groups Democrats like India and he will help the Republicans keep control of committee assignments and the flow of legislation and nothing Democrats care about will ever get to vote and that's what matters\nThat uh WHYY state Davis day thinking so much for being with us today good to be with [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd we are continuing to learn more about the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning the attack took place at the tree of life congregation ... morning services were being held eleven people were killed and six others were injured Adam hurts meant was a member of the congregation he's not the director of marketing with the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh\nHe's with us on

they still have not been able to notify or the families of those who've died and so uh so so far nobody knows the identity of\nWhat you tell us about the congregation what kind of ... was it what stands out from your time there\nBut boy with him a tree of life a was a combination of two synagogues in Pittsburgh emerged to conservative synagogue so really lovely a welcoming place um\nIt's in the heart of scroll hill which is a central part of the Jewish community a lot of the population of George Pittsburgh and ... just a wonderful warm and welcoming place\nAnd I never would have to ask you about this this has to just strike at your core\nAnd forgive me this news is so fresh you probably haven't haven't had time to process it but I I just wonder what's going to your mind at a at a time like this I mean did you did this ... strike at your sense of safety as an American as an American Jew I just I'm just wondering how you are processing this\nReally a I'm a shock to anybody in this community you know the truth is that ah we're lucky in Pittsburgh that generally the Pittsburgh Jewish community is a one of the safest Jewish communities in the United states\nUm we've had a community security director for a couple of years who's really been improving security at the synagogue in that church agencies and so this comes as even more of a shock to me and to everybody here\nHow do you think you'll process to spend the next couple of days\nThat's hard to tell him we are having a a community gathering or tomorrow at five PM oh that's a really all of the synagogues and in Pittsburgh are participating and\nI think in my mind it's time to come together joined together as a community I feel like a Jewish Pittsburgh as a family and so this attack really does feel like a an attack on my own family\nAnd and finally how how can others in the community support you I'm sure there are many grieving with who are not Jewish what what can they do to support you at this time\nWe've had an amazing outpouring of support both from the church community and the non Jewish community all over Pittsburgh or even now you know just\nA a couple of hours after this terrible incidents um local businesses came out with food for our grief center and gotten taxed and emails from churches I think that uh you know the best thing to do is to come together and help the community
