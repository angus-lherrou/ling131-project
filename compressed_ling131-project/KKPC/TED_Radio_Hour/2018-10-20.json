Bush administration have tried to increase water deliveries to farmers and California's massive Central Valley project where water from snow fed reservoirs gets pumped south to arid farmland but those deliveries are perennially cut back due to attempts to protect endangered fish and drought\nThe president's order would speed up the current review of this as well as to other projects in Oregon and Washington\nIf environmental restrictions are loose and there will likely be a pro long legal battle and one of the biggest champions of this latest plan is deputy interior secretary David Bernhardt

has been traveling with them and she's now on the bridge that separates quarter mile from Mexico and she's with us now Emily thanks so much for talking to us a little bit more about where you are and what's happening right now\nSo I'm On this bridge as his head that cut by spot on Mexico and what I'm saying right now are just in their diapers kids without shoes on tons of men and ... it feels like I'm In the midst of a humanitarian crisis\nCan you just tell us a bit more about what people are telling you who they are and why they've been willing to go through all this so most of them\nCame from Hunter S and there are so folks from El Salvador and some from Guatemala that the vast majority of from Hunter S\nLargely is that this wasn't planned they read or heard about the caravan\nAnd conditioned and in Honduras are bad that they can't get gas that there's no food that they're they're simply\nStarving and that they had to take a chance they also felt much safer and numbers travel to Mexico as part of a big group of people instead of just a loan or paying a smuggler or coyote to take them\nNow understand that a number of people were actually turning back now\nThat's right so Guatemala has said buses to take a those migrants you want to return to Honduras to take them back voluntarily and so\nI talked to a woman by the name of Rosalind I looked as as a as she's twenty six years old she said like many of the other migrants that she started to join the care benefits and come to decision but but she regretted that decision along the way\nShe has four children back in Honduras and she said she knew the trip would be hard but it's even worse than she imagine\nThose that are in that they made it out on the line and more so she says to me she'll suffer back and then dressed but at least she'll keep her life and she refers to the fact that yesterday the Mexican police deployed tear gas against migrants tried them from Mexico and that people got hurt and so she says given these conditions it's better that she returned to Honduras\nBut you said that there are still several thousand people there so that suggests that most of the people are going to try to stay in and move on keep moving with the caravan\nThat's right up and for the point I mean I'd say there's maybe two to three thousand people on the spread most of them are moving forward I talked to a twenty four year old Kevin cut them India he's traveling with his younger sister and a\nFriend or they've been travelling for three days they camped out on the bridge last night with thousands of the other migrants 'em and they want to reach Florida with their friends here's what he had to tell me\nYeah knows if there was with me\nHe says the Europe becomes your friends so few becomes scared you use that fear to your favor and it pushes you forward and he says we're going to try and get across Mexico anyway they had and that includes by boat or trying to cross the bridge that I'm On right now\nYou know President Trump has reacted furiously to this he's been speaking you rather that campaign rallies demanding that Mexico closed the border by any means necessary he claimed to send us troops to the southern border I I was wondering if that message is getting through to the people that you've been talking to and what sense do you have from all the both the Margaret sending authorities there\nI Would say that virtually none of the migrants on the spread really know what Trump is saying they don't have cell phone service or they don't have money to charge your cell phone so it's basically word of mouth they know Trump doesn't want them they absolutely\nKnow that but that's almost meaningless to them what they want to do is leave their lives they're they're very far they're very violent life behind and on tourists are so they're going to push forward\nBut I have this sense today on the bridge that this is not going to end well I don't have the sense that all of a sudden Mexico is going to let these three thousand people in 'em and so it makes me wonder what's gonna happen\nTo them that this is this is going to turn for them to a humanitarian crisis where these people are going to go I don't think it's going to end well\nEmily Green as a reporter based in Mexico and she's with us now from the bridge that separates Mexico from Guatemala with thousands of

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this\nIt absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is and he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of thing when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that things offices are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed him and I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described a six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other show as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to support the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often disproportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nShe wanted to talk with she can't 'cause she just doesn't have the voice yet and then once
