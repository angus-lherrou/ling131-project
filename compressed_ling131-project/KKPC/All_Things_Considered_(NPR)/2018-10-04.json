planets collide she uses to actual cannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nThrough [noise]\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large collusion knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat his rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRocks paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that are men grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nA amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to tests where we can prove whether or not the men actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became in the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation you're saying it\nPart of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've become a kid who was
