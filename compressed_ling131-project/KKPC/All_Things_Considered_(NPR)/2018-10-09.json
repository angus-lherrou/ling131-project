several hours and John Young with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un they talked about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and scheduling second meeting with President Trump called it a good trip\nThen he was in Beijing Today and that does it was notably not as good Chinese foreign minister ... had some sharp words for ... about the state of U.S China relations NPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing and he joins us now Hampton ... ...\nSo what exactly was sat in front of reporters what were these remarks that were so critical to us from China\nWill whiny really started out on a pretty harsh note saying to us it constantly escalated trade and tensions with China waited harm China's interest in regards to Taiwan and it it made a lot of baseless accusations against Chinas foreign and domestic policies\nWanting noted that compared come to brief him about his trip to North Korea and to seek that China's cooperation and he said this is exactly why we should be cooperating and not confronting each other\nDid Pompeo respond to any of these criticisms in front of reporters\nWell he said to us and China were in fundamental disagreement on ... points and I think what came out through this was that China feels that the U.S is just launching an all out sort of Cold War on every front\nAnd I think this has something to do with the speech that vice president Mike Pence gave last week\nWhere he accused China of malign efforts to undermine President Trump in the upcoming elections\nYeah that was just one of the things I mean really it was across the board from stealing American intellectual property to human rights the treatment of the week or a minority in she's young it was really confrontational and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy would Chinese officials take such a fence at Mike Pence's speech if the vast majority of what she was saying substantively it steps the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an inconvenience speech to be giving welcome here was making this trip\n[noise] you know this has been building up earlier this year we had a national security strategy an official document which basically means China as one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude\nYou know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this this depiction of China is really a a rogue regime and one of the top threat to US security that\nThat has to be dealt with harshly I really think that's the the tone that China's reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials have been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China\nOr because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's top stance with China hurt the US's ability to reach a deal with North Korea\nOr well certainly that's the implication of what happened today of course we're seeing a confluence of factors not just the north Korea issue that the U.S needs China's help on it's it's just so many issues of global importance but to us seems to want to put a competition with China in\nFront of cooperation on these global issues\nChinese involvement is making a ... a marketing executive says Kenyans can learn something from

all things considered ... Chang mid term elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party many presidents try to shy away from that idea but not Donald Trump he has a lot on the line next month and she knows it as NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nWhat does Donald Trump think is at stake on election day well just about everything if Democrats\n[noise] they're then\nThey're going to raise your taxes you get a prime all over the place you're going to be boring rows of order below lose your rights to those guns you're going to ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it\nThey want to join a marriage in June Venezuela\nThey really do even for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president lost a midterm election knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing the house is is a problem losing the sun is Wichita struck\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nYou suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved within the house the big the big problem will be the job of endless investigations of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had dug high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the Benghazi investigation on steroids\nThis has been ... in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means that Trump's are is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to tell\nVoters former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are re elected to the majority of ... of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get is America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIt is possible to try to lead which was another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies\nOn particular issues but we're talking about a climate today that is much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago and so do if the Democrats word or two people it would be you know an ugly was not fun our\nSome supporters of the president paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did the Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever says that you should not only fire just clearly they had no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do real fifty six Estes Garcia Obama people would have felt like when there will be three it's a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTrump rules his party by fear they're going to see him a lot less if they get their butts kicked he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser\nOr not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an algae beats he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of ban\nThat steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that that really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMidterm and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people yeah\nUp to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course there's kind of just movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now still does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now or as long as you're being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trained as the mystery of the day\nAnd I always said I said I had her mind for me actually\nBeckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out unless you didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her\nThat guy was to me after I sat and he said no they're actually really good for and it's hard to get caught himself the forest\nTold me that I was actually a really good for a girl\nWhen leading guitar maker fender congested a consumer survey and twenty Fifteen it was surprised to

people off the street it sends them away for mandatory prison terms if they have prior violent crimes in their past the question for the court today was whether certain kinds of robberies or

justice to get him to be a more moderate figure on this bench Everytime huh but what about the the fear that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle was so partisan whatsoever in Christ I think is the word you used\nThat there would be this cloud of partisanship hanging over him and a hangover the court did you see any sign of that\nNight in the courtroom today Brett Kavanaugh of course introduced

Chang this morning began with a surprise resignation from the White House Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's got an incredible job she's a fantastic person very importantly the tree also is somebody that gift\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for trying twenty\nI can promise you what are we doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nAll right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of this ... I also so why now why is he really stepping down now well\nThat is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote her resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look so good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally millionaire self she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure form\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe some time in the future time to make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as\nKind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right when you go to hell\nYeah so the thing is different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leading on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that is true of many writers of his foreign policy team but she hasn't been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley has confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get can use a decade she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different what the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately now some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but are we to assume that this is really the end of her political career\nWe are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty um she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established and it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands [laughter] of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump family\nThat's NPR's Mara Liasson thanks Martin thank you [noise] the national Security Agency is the country's largest intelligence age\nAnd see and among its most secretive from NSA headquarters is a huge black cube of a building surrounded by endless parking lots and tight security out in Fort Meade Maryland just outside Washington the agency's work touches everything from a Russian hacking to cyber warfare\nTo the privacy of us citizens yet the NSA rarely speaks oh NPR's Greg Myre we paid a visit there to meet someone who would speak and who wants to make the agency more open\nThe in essays Rob Stuart is a talkative guy at a place that specializes in eavesdropping\nA big federal government agency it spends a lot of taxpayer dollars and so as a general matter I think the public has a right to know how it's funds are being spent\n... became the NSA inspector general in January as an independent watchdog it the sprawling intelligence agency he really likes to talk about whistle blowers\nI felt very strongly that this was a key function for an inspector general's office to have a robust whistle blower program at\nHis office received five hundred and sixteen calls on its hotline during a recent six month period they run the gamut from complaints about contractors who allegedly charge too much to whistle blowers who claim they suffered reprisals\nStorage a former prosecutor can discuss them only in general terms still he's playing a visible role at an agency that often seems invisible with its spy missions and classified budget\nThe NSA it's always been the most secret agents in the United states far more secrets than the CIA\nAuthor James Bamford has written for books on the NSA and still find that challenging to get information like how many people work there\nSomewhere between twenty five thousand and fifty thousand somewhere around there\nThe ... broad mandate includes electronic surveillance on the likes of Russia and China\nPreparations for cyber warfare and guarding against foreign tampering of the U.S election system former NSA contractor Edward Snowden a whistle blower to some and a traitor to others revealed many agency secrets in twenty Thirteen\nSince then the NSA his taste much greater criticism in the debate over privacy in the digital age again James Bamford\nThe problem I've always found what they say is a there are laws out there that say they shouldn't do this show gave that than in the past they have gotten around them and that's why we ended up with the uh is dropping scandals\nThere are hints of the new approach the NSA Director used to hire and fire the inspector general under new rules store is the first nominated by president and confirmed by the Senate in July ... released an unclassified version of a semi annual report something never done before\nAnd there's the office logo when store to arrive the office of the inspector general R. O. Y. G. had the same one as the NSA within eagle at its center\nAnd I thought wait a minute we're independent gee he put together a graphics team are logo now has a big all which looks like it's doing oversight I think\nHis recent report does address weighty issues like the government's use of the foreign intelligence Surveillance Act or fight so\nWe found that there were several deficiencies that had the potential to impact protection of us person privacy\nHe also raised concerns about Internet searches that could jeopardize civil liberties however the details are only in the classified version of his report\nShortly after taking the job storage invited watchdog groups to the NSA one attendee niche Whelan box of the project on government oversight says this storage\nHe I think he's a breath of fresh air over there\nBut he predicts it will be hard to change the culture around whistle blowing\nThe fear of retaliation Israel I mean a lot of people don't want to even go to all that even if they could ultimately prevail many months or even in some cases years down the road it's just it's a it's a headache it's a nightmare\n... says China is offering thousands of scholarships and the hope that some of the Pakistani students will become ... teaches right now he says there's about twenty two thousand Pakistanis studying in China the fourth largest Saudi of foreign students in the country [noise]\nOne of those talks to Sonny's who wants to study in China is and um she only gives me a fuss name she was a long black rose black headscarf and a black face spouse she jokes about how nobody can tell her age [laughter]\nShe's currently studying fuzzier therapy\nAnd so this is my high cities I may go to China do you think it opens job opportunities that you've studied Chinese\nI think too because as I'm studying to be and if I go I should I feel like the food and visit her do their best to sue I can go there for my high status\nShe says even if she doesn't study that she hopes she can visit some day and that reflects something else happening in Pakistan\nThis new sense that China's cool\nIt signals a profound transformation in Pakistan's relationship with China\nFor decades it was centered around security and the shed just trust that neighbor India now it's slowly becoming a relationship between people and that might make this old relationship even stronger Andrew small is the author of the book the China Pakistan access\nI think you start to have something that is actually a more sort of sustainable cultural place just for the relationship and you up for it it's just being so uh staying in the ...

down there I guess the hurricane mornings didn't uh didn't to interrupt the proceedings down there\nNot just being from Florida John ... or\nSomething let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all you have to let them know the number one vote count 'em and you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about more than just the sport that vaguely\nWith all athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was after we okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right way but more so than just getting out of all I think\nYou have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of the time the state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that are really affect you\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there now you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use his clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question but but what just things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of Europe from Anna for but I Do think you'd want to hear from lawyers who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not affected by the law of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly did the Saudis murder ... that provocative question is the headline of a New Yorker article\nExploring what happened to crush again fifty nine year old Saudi dissident and journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate in stumble a week ago today\nAnd was never seen walking out Robin Wright wrote that New Yorker article she is a long time chronicle or of the middle east who's been visiting Saudi Arabia since Nineteen eighty one\nAnd she joins me now Robin good to speak with you\nGood to be with you let me flip back on you that question that you posed in the New Yorker how real a possibility is it that Saudi Arabia murdered Saudi journalist ...\nIt's just stunning that there is no proof of life now in a week and that the Saudis have offered no explanation for what happened to him his fiance waited for eleven hours outside of the conflict and\nFinally because he left his cell phone behind with a warning to call forties she did and that's where we stand and that's as little as we know today\nThe Saudis have offered a denial of any involvement the embassy here in Washington put out a statement calling or any claims of involvement outrageous and expressing concern for ... well being um it sounds as though you take those denials with a grain of salt\nWell I'm very struck by the fact you all had talked to me quite frequently over the past year about the threat he felt to his life even being in Washington DC\nYou've known him for decades I should mention\nI've known him for a long time and Jamal head I've talked to him quoted often over the past year in his growing criticism\nAbout the government effectively led by the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and he he told me in August that he was worried about a threat to his life and said that the kingdom would like to see him out of the picture as he put it\nI think he didn't realize how real that possibility would date or otherwise he would not have gone into the consulate\nIn Istanbul yeah you're right that the mystery surrounding his disappearance fits into a broader pattern a trend of silencing dissent to me about that what's the pattern that you see\nThe pattern is a clamp down on activists even as the\nGovernment talks about reforms in modernizing society and opening up to whether it's women wore the young a social life and allowing movie theaters for the first time it's very striking that that can just as it\nAllowed women to drive also started picking up some of the biggest went in after this one was recently been sentenced to death\nAnd one of the most striking things during all it are said to me with quite recently when he said that the crown prince was totally autocratic and\nTotally a liberal and that he was concerned not just for his own life but for others which had led him\nTo take a position he never thought he wouldn't remember this is a man who was a reluctant dissident he someone who had ordered the monarchy and still didn't principle it was the typing hole and the the ...\nOf the young crank ... that had led him to worry about his own life and to speak out the first time after years of saying nothing on his own friends and\nI said how far outside the realms of what is normal and Saudi Arabia are the crown princes tactics I mean Saudi Arabia as you well know it's never claimed to be a liberal democracy\nLook there are many ... governments around the world and Saudi Arabia has arguably the most abysmal record on human rights of any country in the world but this kind of\nExtra territorial action is really very unusual and a crackdown against someone who's not in Saudi Arabia crack down on people who should be the face\nOf a new young person who claimed that he was a reformer really is very telling about the state of the kingdom\nThank you Robin thank you that's the New Yorkers Robin Wright speaking with us about the disappearance of Saudi writer and dissident ...\nIt's been a little more than a year since the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct animal training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places and the rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as news\nTo Peter ... co owner of ... deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until you can call in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual\nHarassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy originally written down now that it's on his radar he says he'll comply you know one of your credit for those\nOf us that we're not used to serve me for the cause of course\nFrank Kenya is Rochester base human resources consultant his clients are small businesses he doesn't even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with the ... point\nKenya estimates over half of the state's small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise than New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including low trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions and requires feedback from employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses
