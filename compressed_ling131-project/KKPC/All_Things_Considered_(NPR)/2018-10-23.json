S. spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remember thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the Trump Administration might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and proper like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the ins with us started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting You're welcome\nAudi residents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the destruction caused by hurricane Michael\nAs a snapshot of where they stand now twelve days after the storm about Seventy thousand customers remain without power some water and sewer systems are not working\nAnd cell phone service is spotty a complete breakdown of communications during and after the storm cripple the emergency response and now it hinders recovery NPR's Debbie Elliott reports Jim\nMelvin lives in ...

undocumented immigrants apprehended for the year was down slightly to just over half a million far below the numbers of the Nineteen nineties into thousands\nStill a senior Trump Administration

early sell off\nAt one point the Dow Jones industrial average that nearly five hundred fifty points before rebounding in the latter part of the day at ... has already been volatile months and market analysts say that could continue has invested worry that the global economic expansion that feel the bull market is beginning to slow\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union a first agreed to this and Nineteen eighty seven and one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect our lives by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them how we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe when they originally created this agreement the idea was that\nThe Soviet Union wouldn't be able to prevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really\nMulti fold no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO\nSo there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do\nAnd to uh Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nI Want to take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the street\nSo it's true that the u._s. is concerned that China might use what's called a dump on twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installations or to hit an aircraft carrier and not whether us ... considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal than they can do so\nCould pulling out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations\nAt this point certainly they both hold today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons and the world\nAnd it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now does leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world less safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that and you could retaliate if they didn't do\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under\nScrutiny and Xi Jinping we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile the largest warhead is the one that has\nThe security and um that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent\n...

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish were going to meet a family now that his walk more than five hundred miles from Honduras to southern Mexico they are two of the thousands of migrants who have formed a caravan to travel north with hopes of reaching the U.S\nPresident Trump has called them and assault on the country and threatened to send the military to the border to these families are undeterred as James Frederick reports from the Mexican state of Chiapas\nAfter only a few days in the migrant caravan twenty eight year old Betty west we only use her first name because of threats against are faced a difficult choice she had come determined to reach the U.S and seek asylum\nYoung young let me add\nOne yeah she says I came with my two brothers and sisters but his Mexican forces blocked the bridge into that country her family said they were leaving the caravan one brother turned around to signing he could make it in the meantime an under us\nHer other brother and sister in law had family send them money and they paid smugglers to take them to the U.S\nBut it costs to eight thousand dollars in the family didn't have enough money for Betty and a five year old son Justin\n... have not been among them by me and my my ...\nIt's really hard she says we don't have a mom she died it's hard to see your brothers would you choose a sister in law over you buddy and just their morals are\nBut not from all on the\nBridge they met this family a grandmother her two daughters and several children bitter current Justin and sort of caravan family the Guatemalan border is now well behind them [noise]\nRight now they're showing up black tarps of of cardboard floor they've laid in the Central Park this little town weeks left\nHere you really get an idea of how thousands of people can survive walking across Mexico\nThat's a radio spots from local government of weeks left a town of about thirty thousand it asked citizens to bring donations of food water in clothing\nFor hours locals have been streaming and getting the migrants almost everything they need\nThe kids here are surprisingly happy upbeat after another twenty mile track in Ninety degree heat today [noise]\n\nJust end in his new ... are obsessed with my Mike in headphones [noise]\nFinding the family to travel with was a saving grace for Betty injustice man man what a game is good she says we felt like turning back after my brothers left me but they knew they could continue north once they met the other family\nGoing back to Honduras she says is not an option\nThan my life\nAs Betty explained she had a tortilla shot back and take who seek out the the Honduran capital five different gangs were extorting her and she owed them five hundred link purists a week about twenty dollars that was nearly half of what a shot may and the gangs threats if she didn't pay they take adjusting\nAnd will not on that and not to ask the land of\nThe pain is so huge she says the kids suffer but she says they can't go back to hunter even though she's heard about families being separated at the U.S border right now just in seems to be having fun on a separate truck north he's bouncing around with his friends his mouth stained blue from a lollipop locals are handing out to kids\nI mean yeah they do like to thank God\nShe says I'll cradle in for a while as we walk because he gets tired but I don't care I'll carry him as far as we have to go the caravan keep spending adjusting safe gives them a sense of family they lost a few days ago it brings out locals with donations it's the only way she could imagine making it to the U.S\nFor NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now and update on the migrant children\nWere separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child not because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring a child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definitely we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe've heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we\nBelieve legal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\nI was lucky that I was a ... some of those projects to flat for lying it's about group of terrorists but they just come to these levels will do the accident be blow up bin Laden and wherever I'm just kind of makes you second guessed it may be most of us have thought and then once this is\nJust like us in stage three I'd do is um this idea of the problem is that you know where I'm not ... ...\nEuros I'm playing on only ones which are very very culturally specific and you can look at this is like playing roles rock and play a guy\nNamed a full days but the the premise not in just about the rest of the nation is about ... the place where it's like I could also play practical in the series is not about leaving my identity behind is about not just being shuttled to a two dimensional idea of it\nSo as your star is on the rise you reach this new level of fame and we'll call this level of fame the Hollywood sex symbol\nOf what you can't see that the audience at this event can is a master's photo from a magazine projected on the screen behind us is race mad lying on a leather couch oil up with a shirt [laughter]\nLike for you [laughter] you could say [laughter]\nYou're kind of put on a pedestal right especially when somebody is like a smart ... current events and issues of the day then you are the kind of woke Internet boyfriends and that as a pedestal you can be knocked off of how precarious does it feel that kind of popularity\nOkay what is I mean it's two things I think about what you said first is this idea of kind\nOf embracing sexuality is a man is brown Ninety particular um that's something that sometimes I feel is like a little bit corny let's face it you know it can be but I also think if somebody is kind of influence to do because I think often brown men you know culture in diaspora not allowed to be sexual sensitive essential dead like\nEither terrorists barbarians are going to come and eat kids\nWill be competing andme escalated and then the objects of design ... you know I didn't turn lies that I caught\nMe as well and in my own mind I never costs myself\nIs that the leading guy was someone who would be you know desire but in that way and so that's really a process of re education and kind of re examining your self image to allow yourself to do that to not itself to be that particularly if you're from a six\nYear you can do the culture so it's actually something that it's it's it's\nI think it's been Paul my journey of growth to to allow myself to occupy that space [noise] um in terms of like being knocked off incident pedestals I mean like you happen to be ten seconds doesn't it you know\nAnd I asked because you do speak out on ideas right you're not afraid to go on some talk show and really say what you think about something and see if you get nervous\nYeah I guess maybe on some level I Do feel like a man maybe there aren't a lot of people like me\nDoing this so I Do feel some responsibility to represent wherever but coming we'd that in speaking to your point of being knocked off as kind of ... and disappointing people\nYou can't represent everyone you climb represent everyone's point of view the idea that I can like you know that any given film where there is like spending I bake them disease to the big sequel goodness gracious me with the night off can satisfied\nExperience of a billion Muslims around the world well how many million South Asians in America that in itself is patronize\nAnd it's an unfair blood into place I think the one responsibility do have is to try and be full\nSelf and that's going to disappoint some people on the religious enough for some people I'm too religious father people I'm going to take a show a few months with some people I'm not taking enough others [noise] you know no one in this room of course [laughter] so\nI think the main the main responsibility you have is like no I'm going to do me like even when it's scary for me even when I'm going to find out more comfort zone than a few to expose I'm going to be my for the most complex self and doing that hopefully you inspire other people in power the people to go like why you know he's going to\nShow up in that and maybe I can to

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish the Trump Administration says it's taking action against some of the Saudi officials at the leaves are responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal ... secretary of state my palm pale made the announcement today\nWe've identified at least some of the individuals responsible including those in the intelligence services the royal court the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries who we suspect to have been involved in Mr to show that we're taking appropriate actions which include revoking bases entering visa lookouts and other measures\nMeanwhile Gina Haspel to head at the CIA is in Turkey today to investigate because you'll just killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that visit Greg hey so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said ... along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nTo CIA never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe how things to take place there um and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they are conducting these sort of separate investigations\nBut there's also negotiations going on on this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement in some sort of negotiation so that's a key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending hassle there\nWell the president clearly wants to stay in very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses uh he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment that then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and my palm pale to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who is responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\nYeah I think we saw today president or the wine
