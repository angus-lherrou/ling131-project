disgusting way of seeing the mob rule in Washington DC\nEvery single one of us in this together this is one of the most important election of our lifetime and we all\nNational political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us to talk about what both parties are doing to gain an edge in this final stretch before the midterm tomorrow Hi there Hi so start with the issues there's all kinds of things that could be weighing on voters' minds these last three weeks of the the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border of crisis with Saudi Arabia [noise]\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field\nThey are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all the house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three\nPick up seats that they need which they don't they need Senate map looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of\nSenate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular we know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout mid term election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries and special election\nAnd what's the closing argument that both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people\nAnd I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress how Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care which is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich\nCreated a huge deficit and to close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security [noise]\nMay I ask you the flip side of a closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what's what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than\nRepublicans are worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought of Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland\nA Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave and how the borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent Democrats know\nThat the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district it is deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about president from how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations I Will work\nWith the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump me a love for two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nAnd love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist\nGoing into Washington I Know exactly where I'm working with I build a relationship on both sides of the aisle\nLove is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that he stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding from statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years and it's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat from McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this each other and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like Nick Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nSnow you may hear with more favorite sites that are full of fixed I can see more and like you to watch for the stories ... ...\n[laughter] yeah that's the snake man may mean those are and he's published hundreds of papers naming over a thousand types of animals lizards snakes the occasional turtle\nUm but a lot of scientists say he's turning out a lot of quantity but not so much quality so that he is flooding their field with these animal names based kind of on slippery like sloppy science\nSo how's able to name a species without good science backing it\nUp at all for this surprising a it turns out that ... they had this big rule book for naming animals but the main role is he pretty much have to yelled ... uh it it doesn't matter if you got any science to back up your new animal declaration you just need to publish first you can even self publish if you want\nAnd so that's kind of what this episode is about in part is how scientists\nThis mess and it's also of course about what happens with Travis and snake man we we went looking for the snake man here and the you know the story got more complicated than we first thought it would be that makes it good story it's a real story oh yeah yeah I I went back and forth on

joined by kj ... Will Stone who covers health care there Well hi Elsa\nSo you know we see a lot of issue ads about health care throughout the state including one that jak genes started but what candidates actually saying about health care on the campaign trail Democrats\nAre certainly framing it as a choice between two very different visions of health care and another referendum on the Affordable CARE Act\nThat voters can expect a GOP to do what they tried to do last year or repeal the healthcare law I'm In this narrative is kind of forcing Republicans to take what I call more defensive posture\nUh it's very much on display in our tight Senate race between Democrats have been the defense of ones for the past eight years but you think it's Republicans now that is seems to be what's happening right now I mean if you just look at the race between Democrat gears didn't cinema\nUm she's using that line of attack against her Republican opponent Martha mix Sally and you know in response from ... how to kind of soften moderate her stance on the issue saying we cannot go back to where we were before the CIA and we need to fix the law and protect people with preexisting conditions\nAnd so for me I think it shows that to win a statewide race in Arizona which before the AC I had one of the highest rates in the country Republicans like make Sally need to reassure voters\nThat they support certain key provisions of the healthcare law and not just a full repeal so you don't get the sense that the mantra repeal and replace resonates anymore in the states not so much and you can see that you know in the political races and a lot of the concern revolves around Medicaid\nArizona expanded Medicaid under the ace EA and we had a lot of people who needed coverage so there was a big rush joined the program\nThat was at risk under the GOP bill and people in Arizona like the state's Medicaid program a Republican moderates like the program it functions well\nSo no one wanted to see that a damaged or cut\nAnd that's where those who shop for insurance plans on the market place they say they want more options cheaper plans lord a doctor bowls but they do not want to see a full overhaul\nYeah on on more options you know we heard current body said that she was hoping to have more choices in terms of health insurance during the next open enrollment season that starts next month what does it look like I mean it looked like there will be more options for the state\nIs looking remarkably better of the market has stabilized states rebounded health experts I talked to say it will be more options and it's really one of the more resilient are examples in the country of the marketplace it's working that's kj these Will Stone thank you very much well thank you [noise]\nThat is all things considered from NPR News\nWe're just getting started with all things considered for a friday afternoon on CPR news\nThousands of Central American migrants from Honduras are heading for the U.

about it it's been Seventeen Days since the Saudi journalist us resident and Washington Post columnist walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and disappeared\nWe're going to spend these next few minutes tracing the reaction from Trump and his national security team how it has swung from\nCondemnation to a rogue killer theory to withholding judgment at least for now\nWe've got NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele column in here to take us behind the scenes on the shifting us position Michelle was on the plane this week to Riyadh and Ankara with secretary of state Mike Pompeo Michelle Hi there and welcome home thank you\nI think we're all familiar with how the story starts by now now the Washington Post there is one of its contribute to his a prominent Saudi journalist\nA vocal critic of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is missing 'cause she'll do is photographing walking into the Saudi conflict that was October second I'm nobody's seen him since when did the Trump Administration first officially when and comment on it\nWell it was by a Twitter as per usual October eighth Trump or rights there's some pretty bad stories going around I Do not like it a few days later he's in the oval office\nThis is a bad situation we can live up to\nThree borders to anybody who's a\nVowing to get to the bottom of this story but also making clear that he does not want to up and very lucrative arms deals and without a\nBut as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to me\nAll right fast forward to this week by now there is mounting pressure from Congress to get to the bottom of the ... really from stand against Saudi Arabia [noise] uh there's information flooding out from turkey all kinds of gruesome details about the killing and even just member meant allegedly of ... D\nAnd secretary of state might not now is on his way to Riyadh with in the hour weeks\nThat President Trump decides I'm going to send my secretary of state to the region you found out about this I Know because Monday morning your son of a quick email to the newsroom saying I just found out I got a seat on the plane I'm running what is it clear as you all were setting out from joint base Sanders what Tom Perez mission was what he was being sent to do\nA mostly just to have face to face conversations with the Saudis about this and he got the call only Sunday night so it was a a very last minute deal\nBut he was avoided us pretty much the whole flight over all we had was a brief conversation with his spokesperson Heather Nauert who said that we should understand this to be an urgent matter because the president sent him they're All right so you're a land in Riyadh and was there a sense of urgency\nI didn't feel it for sure I mean I got off the\nPlane them fold my microphone out and there was a foreign minister Adel Abdul they're chatting on the tarmac with my ... about the plight of\nThe usual that [noise] the meanwhile while view the secretary of state and his whole delegation are in Saudi Arabia here in\nWashington President Trump floated the idea of rogue killers\nIt sounded to me like maybe there's a big role ... we're going to get to the bottom of the first\nPresented to support the theory were you and other reporters on the plane able to ask pump a oh what's going on with us\nHe kept his distance from us the whole day when he was having these meetings and it was only after he had met with Mohammed didn't sell them on the young crown prince is really kind of a power broker in Saudi Arabia President Trump called in to this meeting and President Trump was the first\nTweet says working right now Donald Trump tweeting just moments ago just spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in the Turkish puzzle was it was what secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nDuring then the state department had to put out a statement confirming that Trump had called in and that the crown prince had in fact denied that he had any knowledge of this and that the king denied as well\nTrump's and moved on his back here in Washington again he gave an interview to the a P on Tuesday in which he compared the allegations against him ... to allegations against his Supreme Court nominee now Supreme Court justice graduate Kavanaugh all\nThe president's saying you're in a in an interview with the Associated Press quote here we go again where if you're guilty until proven innocent of the show\nYou buy now you're left ... flown on to turkey where of course ... ... has disappeared Turkish investigators are presenting all kinds of evidence does Mike Pompeo said he's found anything out he's found any facts at this point\nNo and in fact it was astounded because we it was as we were leaving Riad we asked him point blank did the Saudis tell you that left Washington Post columnist was dead yeah what they say he fed\nAnd I want to talk about any of the facts are they they didn't want you either and if they want to have the opportunity to complete the investigation thorough white\nAnd he called that an incredible success\nI'm guessing there were some follow up questions among the press corps on the flight home as you all are headed back you flew back Wednesday from Ankara back to Washington After the ... mission that was not to find out the facts of what happened you land a and then the next thing we hear from the administration is we need to give ... more time\nThat's right and and he did say that on the on the trip as well because we asked him about the optics of this um that it looks like business as usual with the Saudis and he insisted that he had very direct conversations that they were serious but he also went into this long kind of an prompted defense of the relationship\nI Do think it's important that every one keeping their mind we'd have walks with important\nRelationships an actual relationships between us Saudi company\nA governmental relationships things we walk on together all across the world\nAnd particularly now as the as this administration is trying to reimpose sanctions on Iran they need the Saudis to maintain the oil markets they need the Turks to stop buying so much crude oil from Iran so there's a lot of geopolitics here at play and this one particular case\nSo here we closed the business on friday a Seventeen Days after Jamal ... walked into that Saudi consulate in Istanbul and disappeared [noise]\nAre we any closer to answers on the the two key questions what happened and what does the U.S going to do about it\nNot really I mean that there is a moving in Congress to push for at least some targeted sanctions against those people who were found to have been involved in this um and the administration has to respond to that President Trump has said the consequences are going to be serious\nWill have to be very severe evidence fed fed 'em but we'll see what happens if\nThey want to give the Saudis a few more days to come up with their story and in the meantime the Turks have been leaking all kinds of information and very gruesome details about this case\nAnd pears Michel ... thank you thank you and\nAnd the last word on this story for now talking to reporters today Trump pointed out Congress will have a role in the U.S response to ... jeeze just appearance he also pointed out that Saudi investment create jobs in many of their states and he added quote I Hope we don't lose track of that\nEasier to give somebody a pain killer and said get over it you talk about Lori like she's a real

journalist and dissident Jamal ... G Saudi Arabia has confirmed on state TV that he is\nDead ... had been missing since October second that's when he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Seventeen Days ago [noise] multiple news reports had pointed to his likely death that this marks the first official confirmation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me now from Istanbul Hi Peter\nI'm Mary Louise what details do we have from this study announcement\nOr very few details of the Saudi press agency is saying at Eighteen people have been arrested or the investigation is ongoing or but as you mentioned there is the first official confirmation\nOr from Riyadh the drum up to show gee uh is dead he was last seen going into the Saudi consulate here in Istanbul on October second\nAnd according to the Saudi press agency after we entered the consulate there was a fight to dispute that broke out and that led to his death we we don't know any more details on that right now\nSaudi TV is reporting you mentioned Eighteen Saudi nationals arrested and among them they also mentioned a general and a royal\nCourt advisor who've been sacked from their positions do we know who these people are are any details about them\nWell a major general Ahmed Asiri was first mentioned to my knowledge in a New York times report this morning that talked about\nA him as someone who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing of course at the royal family ah including a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia\nAnd of many folks have been saying that this probably could not have happened without his knowledge and possibly without his order\nA but at this point the Saudis are saying that this intelligence officer and advisor to sell them on a has been sacked and also said to Tony who's an advisor\nTo the real court so possibly a strategy to to uh put some scapegoats out there and the questions were made in terms of who was giving the orders for this operation let me ask you this Peter what do we know about timing why put this out in the middle of the night there from Saudi Arabia\nI Can't answer that really um there have been a accelerating investigation certainly and the pressure has been growing a after initially uh being rather cool to the whole idea of President Trump has been\nA saying there will be severe punishment if the Saudis are found to have been behind this and it seems as if there is a move in Riyadh no uh to to move ahead with this and not continue with their initial statement which seemed to be more and more untenable\nPosition as a minute did the Saudis statement tonight explain in any way how what they're saying now is completely different from what they were saying two weeks ago\nThat's not explained a but it is completely different the original explanation has been\nUm he walked into the cost of lives he needed some paperwork he walked out within an hour and we don't know what happened to him that has been the official on the record deposition ever since this happened on October second\nAh than we have seen this investigation move forward poking more and more potential holes in that story and making it look less and less tenable and now a very late at night the Saudis have come out with an official statement admitting yes he's dead we have these people under arrest\nAnd we'll just have to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials\nTo the Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis which was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet yes some libraries had been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right and that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David ... he is the United nations special repertoire on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world cave has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\n[noise] absolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of ... killing and those same really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a\nOf a fistfight ... seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nI have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we are talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation and um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations for for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like\nCrimes against humanity and genocide or they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council\nCould do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block the Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely and and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international eyes it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there will be any number of options available to them whether its\nFrom that person's trauma nobody wants to really get into it and it's much easier to give somebody a pain killer and say get over it you talk about Lori like she's a real person she is a real person\nHow long has she felt have you felt close to this character 'cause we should say that this was kind of you're coming out party for you personally um can you talk a little bit about that idea\nIt was a role I had been on a TV series prior where I was one of six women with maybe two lines weak and here was a script that was completely a character a full character with a really emotional and dramatic arc and so for me\nHonestly her name is on every page of the script and I was thrilled I'm a bit of a smart alec I have a trash talk now not an intellectual in a big emotional hug a lot and here was a role of a quiet intellectual repressed\nVirginal dreamer a who walked down the street and sang to herself I Wish I had you all of\nJust [laughter]\nYou know there was a romance to her and so for me she was the best role really I'd ever been able to play\nOne thing that's interesting is I'm thinking of how John Carpenter who along with a co writer Deborah he'll created the franchise you're listed along with him as an executive producer and that must be incredible to think like you started out in Nineteen year old [laughter] and now your executive producer of it\nI never thought I'd have any half Audi\nReally though I mean I Know I'm listening to this people are like Tony Curtis and ... like you don't

what a gift is when you don't expect something and then it's given to you\nAnd you open it and go wow\nCue that incredible and that's what I feel David Gordon Green and Danny McBride gave me when they allowed me\nTo go where we had to go to explain and honor the courage and tenacity of Laurie Strode who represents all women who've been addressed all women who've had to fight back all women who've survived\nAnd that's a privilege and not something I took lightly well it\nHas been an incredible journey was a real honor to speak to you\nWell thank you Audie it's been a a great privilege and happy
