NPR News Fort Lauderdale Florida\nThere was a marked the escalation and the release of families who are being detained by us immigration authorities near the southern border as Texas Public Radio's David Martin Davies reports from San Antonio immigrants are being dropped off in math at area bus stations [noise]\nA greyhound bus station in downtown San Antonio sister Denise Little Rock of interfaith welcome coalition scrambling to assist the sudden influx of families\nThe detention centers and the holding centers at the border just gets so full\nAnd he said it really fast and quietly like he was trying to make a point of toning it down and then the crowd of course chanted lock her up lock her up\nUm Clinton is one of the people who this week had received an explosive device hadn't sent to a center her as as part of that um attack I'm\nSo I'm One other note President Trump says he is planning to go to Pittsburgh soon OK NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith thank you very much for being with us Tom You're welcome now we're back to Michelle in Philadelphia\nFederal authorities are also investigating the spate of pipe bombs male two prominent Democrats and CNN this past week they have charged a Florida Man named Cesar say are he is to appear on Monday\nThe individuals who received the improvised explosive devices were regular target of verbal attacks from President Trump last night though the president bristled at the suggestion that his rhetoric is to blame for what he called the sinister actions of one individual\nBut we wondered if it is fair to ask if his tone has created a climate conducive to violence like the mail bombs or the carnage at a synagogue today\nI talked about this with professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson she is an expert on political discourse at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of communication and we spoke so that we could raise the complaints of critics that President Trump has normalized a quote unquote of the ring of people are by which we need a tax on political opponents as enemies\nThe president the United states has a unique capacity to determine what are accepted political norms of discourse\nAnd to the extent that expands those outside the normal boundaries he says to everyone else those expanded boundaries are no boundaries in which you can not only speak but speaking public and not be afraid of sanctions and for that we have the whole Donald Trump accountable\nI mentioned you that we've been traveling around a state of this week meeting with all kinds of people I spoke with a group of Trump supporters were going to hear from them a later this weekend\nThey prefer not to have heard any of the president's attacks on individuals the media you know I was asking them about the tone that the president said but they prefer not to hurt any of this\nWe all live to some extent within our own like minded communities and when we live inside our own media bubble were far more likely to see the world through the filter that it offers so to the extent that the president is saying things that have been normalized inside that constituency they're not going to remember it specifically it's going to be a background assumption\nThere have been any device of moments in American history of any violent moment I mean assassinations politically motivated bombings the civil war for that matter how old are you can ... this year as a person who studied communication throughout our history\nThe difference between then and now is that now exist in an environment in which these horrific acts that is bombs were sent to people yielded two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not\nWhether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them but if you're just as we've lost our capacity be horrified by the sort of action we've lost our ability to say whether\nThey were Democrats or Republicans we disapprove of this action profoundly and we're going to have in the climate that is conducive to it something that we are in any way contributing to for example when someone's driving around with a van with pictures that suggest just remember him at the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun\nThat that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then I tend to rally in park that van go to a rally where some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T shirts\nHow we manage to normalize that so much that in this moment we couldn't come together and say whoever did this this is highly problematic we disapprove of it and we're going to look at the broader culture and how can we minimize the liquid there will ever happen\nAgain that is Kathleen Hall Jamieson professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for communication her latest book is cyber war how Russian hackers and trolls helped elect a president what we don't can't and do know professor dreams and thank you so much for talking with us from time to be with you [noise]\n\nThank you so much for hosting us and thanks to all the people who offered us pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is straight to have you all so nationally Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state me and for the last six years Pennsylvania have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shaped and generally acknowledge to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion as controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that sure\nSure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that naming off\nThat all that's how they approach problems and we put all that together and it always allowed us to get one step ahead of that criminal by pulling everybody's unique perspective together and that's essentially what the problem solvers ... says it's a legislator version of that\nAnd I tell everybody I mean if you ever had a chance to sit on a one of those meetings you'll be so proud of your country because you out of the guy cannot sell who the Democrats or Republicans are that room you know when I leave Congress whatever that is are under whatever circumstances that is I just want to be able to say\nThat I I did my part when I was there to advance that belief that we got to get rid of this judging people based on what box they checked on their voter registration form when they're Eighteen we got to get past that\nCongressman who's actually thanks so much for for talking to us today and kill\nAn WHYY Dave Davies is still with us for a couple more seconds ... congressman fitzpatrick almost went to ... took pains to identify more as a member of the No Labels group or the problem solvers conscious than he did with the Republican Party what do you make that\nHe has a case to make that he's an independent who voted against the repeal of Obamacare he's gotten support support from gun control groups Democrats like India and he will help the Republicans keep control of committee assignments and the flow of legislation and nothing Democrats care about will ever get to vote and that's what matters\nThat uh WHYY state David stay thank you so much for being with us today to to be with [noise]\n\n\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd we are continuing to learn more about the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning the attack took place at the tree of life congregation ... morning services were being held eleven people were killed and six others were injured Adam hurts man was a member of the congregation he's now the director of marketing with the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh\nHe's with us on the line now Mr Hersman words I Do not have words to express my grief actual loss I'm so very sorry\nThank you very much I really appreciate that\nCan you tell us any more about how you found out about the shooting\nI found out about it pretty much how would that help that or is it is really\nDo you know if you know of anyone who was hurt\nI don't uh unfortunately this er and ah as far as I Know are they still have not been able to notify or the families of those who died and so uh so so far nobody knows the identity is\nWhat you tell us about the congregation were kind of synagogue wasn't what stands out from your time there\nBut all the same ... tree of life or was a combination of two synagogues in Pittsburgh emerged to conservative synagogue so really lovely a welcoming place um it's in the heart of ... which is\nA central part of the Jewish community a lot of the population of George Pittsburgh in school how just a wonderful warm welcoming place\nAnd I never would have to ask you about this this has to just strike at your core\nAnd forgive me this news is so fresh probably even haven't had time to process it but I I just wonder what's going to your mind at a at a time like this I mean did you this is ... strike at your sense of safety as an American as an American Jew I just I'm just wondering how you are processing that's\nReally a I'm a shock as anybody in this community you know the truth is that ah we're lucky in Pittsburgh that generally the Pittsburgh Jewish community is a one of the safest Jewish communities in the United states\nUm we've had a community security director for a couple of years who's really been improving security at the synagogue in that church agencies and so this comes as even more of a shock\nMe and to everybody here\nHow do you think you'll process this in the next couple of days\nThat's hard to tell him we are having a a community gathering or tomorrow at five PM oh that's a really all of the synagogues and in Pittsburgh are participating and\nI think in my mind it's time to come together joined together as a community I feel like a Jewish Pittsburgh has a family and so this attack really does feel like a an attack on my own family\nAnd and finally how how can others in the community support you I'm sure there are many grieving with who are not Jewish what what can they do to support you at this time\nWe've had an amazing outpouring of support both from the church community and the non Jewish community all over Pittsburgh\nOr even now you know just a a couple of hours after this terrible incidents um local businesses came out with food for our grief center and gotten tax than emails from churches\nI think that uh you know the best thing to do is to come together and help the community he'll\nSome if people want to give we're going to open an aftershock bought a closes a fund for victims of terror and uh they can certainly contribute\nTo that she can read it there for now Mr hearts and thank you so very much for speaking with us it's such
