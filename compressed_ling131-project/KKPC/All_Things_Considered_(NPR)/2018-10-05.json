Shapiro all the senators have been going in and out of a secure underground room at the Capitol viewing one copy of the FBI's report on sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe reporters confidential and reactions have been divided Democrats called incomplete Republicans say it was Thoreau a final vote on Kavanaugh could take place within forty eight hours and there are just a few undecided senators for more on that we are joined by NPR's\nKelsey Snell California there as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be comforting for a lot of Republicans a Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh after a briefing this morning he talked with some of us later in the day as he was heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabinet and he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who was a huge Kavanaugh supporter before he says if anything this report made him feel stronger about that support here's what he said\nAnd I think after all this is a stronger in terms of understanding the facts and are looking for and I am ready to vote\nBut what about those three undecided senators we've been talking about all week what have you heard from them\nYeah we're focused still on Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona those three Republicans are really critical here Murkowski has mostly been ducking reporters and she's gone in and out reading that report for much of the day others like Susan Collins of Maine and flake\nThey say you know they haven't said exactly how their vote but they both say they found this report helpful\nCollins called a thorough and flake who is one of the people who actually called for this investigation he told reporters he thought it was Thoreau as well and he says he hasn't seen any new corroborating evidence which is the thing that he said before he Libya yes if that was the case if there wasn't that corroborating evidence that would be found\nThere were still kind of reading material leaves on how they're going to vote what about the contents of this report how much we learned about what's in it\nHonestly virtually nothing because they can't tell us anything it is confidential it is locked behind those closed doors in some basement has the capital\nAnd we but we do know is that it's about forty five pages and they spoke to about nine people and NPR's confirm the names of six of them and most of those people are friends of cat on forward from high school they also spoke with Deborah Ramirez who was a classmate at Yale\nAnd she's the one who accuse cabinet of drunk and lay exposing himself to her in the early to mid eighties\nSo like I said there's that one copy and the senators are just circulating through and telling us that you know that these are mostly interviews and I'm a transcription and some of the conversations that they had we also know that Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed so they are not a part of this and denser pretty upset about that\n[noise] so senators now have the report the Senate majority leader has said he wants to vote in the next forty eight hours what happens in that time\nUh sometime likely tomorrow morning there will be a procedural vote\nThat is necessary for them to move on they need fifty one votes to pass that and that makes this a really key test because fifty one of those does all it takes to approve his confirmation when that comes up so if they can get to the fifty one votes now it's very likely they'll be able to get to it wants to the final vote comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their minds after procedurals out like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because vice president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final vote comes about thirty hours later that means sometime maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battleground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this and energize them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat\nAnd this was in the state of North Dakota\nRight that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a cabinet and gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much ink\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kavanaugh drink he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them buy food from the ... and then told me what exactly to do first in the field sending a request for the form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former run this had been pre filled by the prison reviewed most spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases would be allowed\nSo you filled out the form do you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent\nUp on a laugh so I did not I was never called buck or read by my food by my computer ah\nGet an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all the other one should learn from the V. so usually a committee or whether it's taken oath and what is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes there is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black and you know I think ... moved confused that was passing out but the black known for his means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the student who intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nThey let me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened to me last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three Rudy forty five year college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to very thorough job and that's a nice little\nFrom which all of this stemming and maybe I can see how that basic belief is different from my basic belief and that's why we had different things different things not because we are lodging is different but because all starting points to a different\nWay of about a minute or so left but I Want to I wanted to ask you about something you write a great deal about the logic of privilege relating virtually to race and gender is that in the area especially right for a logical treatment\n[noise] yes the arguments are um uh get very vehement and some people get very upset about the whole question of privilege and identity politics and I think it's important for us to understand everyone's point of view\nAnd often it's a misunderstanding about what privilege means because for example white privilege does not mean the all white people are better off than all non white people\nIt means that any white person if\nThey had all the same characteristics and the exact same life except that they were black as well we would expect them to be worse off in society and so some white people get upset because they say things like but I I grew up poor and I have to work really hard so that means that I didn't have white privilege and we need to know\nThe fact that indeed that all white people who are really struggling and we shouldn't let our discussion the privilege\nIt raised that fact that they're all white people are struggling because if we raised that fact than they get angry and feel that they have been disenfranchised and that they have no voice but we need to understand that if they were back then they would have an even last time and that's what the logic and the structure of privileges really about\nDr Chang thank you for joining us again is always a pleasure to have you and ... good luck with the book Eugene

McDonald's sixteen times as he held a knife that aside the release of the video the shooting spark widespread protest\nA question no one is better poised to answer then NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so speaking of partisanship I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about that\nThat he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons that you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before a Supreme Court nominee using part is a language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition\nPurely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact cause retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against\nThe nominee and he said that he'd like cabinet as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision to Kevin wrote but Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that a parent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the record who it is not the ills to get a new justice you know fully do put a part time job\nNow I don't really think the Kavanaugh as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones\nIt appears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today but I'm plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens oh another so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it shouldn't be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect chief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nYou know Republican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall\nIs said Brett Kavanaugh well we're less than the ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be mean for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes where the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that end than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated I Would expect him to be seated probably Tuesday Morning

political differences within their larger relationship to each other and to the court and to the country and to the law\nNow that gets harder after a confirmation process such as this process that is stressed by the collision of major movements within the culture\nWithin the Supreme Court for years we've heard stories about justices with ideological differences having close friendships having a relationship that flourishes even though they might be on opposite sides of a political divide do you think this affects that kind of dynamic\nIt could and that is what concerns people the relationship between for example Antonin Scalia the anchor of the conservative wing and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are very different justice and yet\nQuite close friends who would spend every New Year's eve together and go to operas together and so on\nThat kind of college geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with a background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can't deal with it but it will make the court more visible\nDoesn't mean they have to come out from underneath always rubs doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN or that they're going to stop their very small group conferences\nBut it does mean that for many people the court has been identified as something different from what it was before\nNPR's Ron Elving is a

Washington I'm Janine Herb's\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins today told the Senate chamber she will vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh shortly after West Virginia Senator

election in November his opponent Republican state attorney general Patrick Morrisey has attacked mentioned repeatedly for holding out one how we will vote for cabinet a final vote on the Supreme Court nominee is expected Saturday for NPR News I'm Dave Mistich in Morgantown West Virginia\nMeanwhile democratic Senator Dick Durbin tells NPR's all things considered the FBI investigation of Kevin ... wasn't as thorough as it should have been\nWhat Susan said yesterday in beer beer investigation she thought it was a thorough investigation I knew we were in trouble or they interviewed ... people no more than ignored eight witnesses produced by a doctor for twenty witnesses produced by mushroom errors that was not a full some complete professional investigation by any means\nSenator Durbin referring there to Senator Susan Collins Utah man has been charged with threatening to use a biological toxin as a weapon for sending caster beans in four letters addressed to President Trump and other top government officials and here's Greg my radio has more\nThe FBI says the suspect William Clyde Allen put his name and home address on the letters he mailed to the president the FBI chief the defense secretary and the chief of naval operations FBI agents arrested Allen at his home in Logan, Utah and he made his first court appearance on friday\nAccording to the affidavit Allen of thirty nine year old navy veteran acknowledge sending the letters and his threatened the government officials previously he said he purchased caster beans on E. bay which were then matched up to create the poison rice soon\nA memory works that way I mean Dr Ford's the scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough\nTo stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about of Ford's account or against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more Broadway\nSo I I I think that it's an important her station to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an and Collins spoke to a great deal in her and her commentary on the floor\nThere's also a presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can dismantle an entire career without any cooperation and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm In the case of Roy Moore when he came up\nAnd accusers came forward to the Alabama Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's cooperation that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of these circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called her credible and expressed sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I Do remember how'd you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was\nThe audience laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this is a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and and sort of enthusiasm from Republicans this has been\nA very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we we saw Brett Stevens and the New York times applied to President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone um let on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hadn't existed in twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that I'm Suzie awesome will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's still unclear I mean there are definitely was if the Republicans told me they were afraid that the poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play\nI don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on the other side that spurred by this sort of gender war uh it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president's ah with the comments that you played\nA I think that really ... the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this and just\nBriefly from each of you know that it looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he is expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly\nIt could I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be the function so it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a ... one of them I I I'm not sure how much of this sort of\nExperience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I think that there's probably did maybe pushing more right where he would have otherwise been had to spend a smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela editor of Russia and columnist for the forward and Kimberly ... chief Washington reporter and columnist for the Boston

from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager\nJason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell the activists I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think by those activists it's hearing like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concerned for what it was for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described ... comic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes as blank um he said that that that that was ... raised in life up to his shoulder\nUm which is not something you can see looking at the ... video up there and said so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look one McDonald you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial that another trial later this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald at present it that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial on how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six soon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the chronic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that wasn't quite a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke some guilty today of second

dropped our lives or dies dollar responsibility tend to lobby our senators typically Senator Murkowski said you know against the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh\nWere Cal ski wound up voting no today as far as tomorrow's vote it's unclear sell it is clear on where she stands on Kavanaugh she says she would be trouble to appear before him especially after what she says where his partisan attacks last week during a student here\nSo I think there are many reasons not to confirm him but I think that one alone and help all of our senators had wrecking\nAnother woman Susan Barnes arrived in Washington from Rockford, Illinois with her daughter Leighton they're also here to protest and read me there are signs Eighteen year old Leighton goes first\nIntegrity still matters no cabin on which is good for a beer with the guy's not good for the Supreme Court\nSusan Barnes says she doesn't want to see Kevin ... on the high court because of the impassioned testimony of Christine Blasey Ford

take their term casting a vote in next month's midterms\nRocky NPR News Washington [noise]\nBack in July when Kavanaugh was named as the nominee among people gathered at the White House for the big announcement was John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome\nIt's pleasure to be with you and my writing thinking you're pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now looking increasingly likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nThe numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised to that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more\nThen twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing that he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think this is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who knew\nHim well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as a family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had by the way he acted\nLike in ... I think that response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course\nInterview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justice as well\nPeople wing and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice rally foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the ...\nSome of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things they shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should he said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\n[noise] well I have experienced this ability of my life you know I was death to the child and I was hit by a car and broke my back when I was Seventeen and couldn't walk for every year and a half\nSo I've had experience with disability I was also a very heavy child who got bullied and teased endlessly because of my weight and developed an eating disorder because of that fourteen and which I didn't eat a meal for three years and still tremendous writing\nSo then I got hit by the ... gained the weight back and then some of it again to spice go\nAnd then you know kind of slowly came off after a couple of years\nAnd then I developed asthma which maybe go on steroids betrayed me eat trees and cause and people I gained a lot of weight and I just made history as the first woman ever to host the official child on the BBC Radio one but the day it was announced that I had that job on the radio it was only announced really that I had gained\nFive dress sizes that causes you to yes in the tabloids and then I talk about the parked outside my house for months to howling abuse it me about my white hoping that I Would react and cry or or ... one of them\nAnd I was you know the ... Gulf my button on the phone call the magazines and putting extra very skinny photos of myself so I have definitely lived through the various different types of damage that come from\nThis obsession with our weight and one thing I Do know from experience of shame is never the way to get anyone to lead a healthy lifestyle which leads to eating too little too much or exercising too little too much\nAnd there's never an attention towards mental health or self love\nIn advertising and I think that's what needs to change I think we need to be more capital needs to be more police especially about diet culture\nSo how do you get away from really kind of easy lazy narrative of oh well now she can experience self love because she's tall and thin and beautiful and looks great and all these dresses well\nI'm lucky that I when it happened when I was being like you know nationally fat shamed I held my own and it was actually still to date the most successful year of my life I Won the most will divest one not yeah I was in a very happy relationship that I entered into at that weight I on the most money I've ever made so I was living it up\nAt that size so therefore it wasn't like that was a low point in my life and now everything's great and that was an amazing time and I never took a weight loss Dale so I think because of the fact that I thrived in that time Mike Korea it's not reflected by\nThe size of my body by the amount of flesh on my bones and I'm really glad that I made all those decisions back then because now I can back it up now\nThat I'm not hypocrite I've lived through this I've always stay true to the same message and all I'm campaigning for isn't body confidence I'm encouraging women to stop thinking about that but he's the one minute I think about their achievements think about their lives thinking about that dreams and that goes in the happiness and how to grow that rather than just shrink themselves [noise]\nThat must make it all the more challenging for you to on a daily basis inhabit this character whose value resides in beautiful dresses and getting texts from a dollar mama\n[laughter] well I think the good thing is that with constantly only making fun of her yeah so that's all the messaging is actually pretty clear that we are against that thought process and thinks she's completely ridiculous\nShoes ridiculous un stomach to help pay her she's ... and\nThe hell's because we couldn't make the messaging around that lifestyle and those priorities ... that they all bad and the fact that look at why she ended up with what the flights that she's now in\nIn the season of a good place to honey has a book that his facetiously titled get out of the spotlight yeah and I understand you're also writing a book in real life\nI Am writing a book in real life I don't know about a conceded this huh [laughter] um it's about shame it's a revolutionary approach to shame on how to kill it\nCanada ever truly be killed\nWell we'll find out but I Believe so I've spent the last three is on a ... a shame just coming out bit by bit by bit every part of my life that brings a nanny and it has given me such a sense of self\nAnd such a strength as such a sense of perspective especially as such adopt industry it's show business you really need to keep your head screwed on your shoulders people ready to get very carried away with stuff that doesn't mean anything at all\nAnd so it has helped me have a real grounding and knowledge of my own value and protection around myself from toxicity\nDreamy Audrey offering so much for talking with ... thank you very much for having me she plays the honey on NBC's The good place which has just become season three\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News support for NPR", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "05"}
