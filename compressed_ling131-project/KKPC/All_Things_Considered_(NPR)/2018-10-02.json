limits\nWhich makes it very hard for developers to get things done efficiently because there's different rules to figure out in the city and it just adds to the cost of development which is part of the problem\nBlum says even just a little uncertainty threatens funding for a project because developers need to know how much rent they're going to bring in to cover their costs private firms like her see themselves on the front line of fixing the housing crisis because federal housing subsidies for the poor have steadily declined since the Nineteen eighties\nBlum says rent control is just a band aid and at the root of the problem is the fact that there's just not enough housing\nThe real solution to our affordable housing crisis is more construction\nOf housing across the whole spectrum\nThe state estimates it needs to build well over a million new units right now land is in short supply and a lot of what is being built is high end\nAnd that's fueling a lot of the anger and

the planet maybe most memorable for another discovery it portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nAre several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblet remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nOn a small end of a dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers in size which was about six or seven times smaller than what poodle is\nShepherd isn't a stronger with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know and really when we find an object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about order\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbit isn't even close to round like earth it's a very elongated lips next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun objects this far out with really elongated orbits or just weird\nOccurrence models of solar system formation don't predict these objects\nJuliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers thinkers out there\nIn easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects and the solar system\nThe gravity of big planets like Jupiter or Neptune Ken sling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happened to wander by but the goblet doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging\nBecker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planning on so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nI guess I have kind of a ticker in my mind of how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful but like I the ticker in my mind just jumped up flick

F. I. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster NPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Jeff\nHi Ari first of all what are these chemicals a pie fast it's an entire group of several thousand men make chemicals in some of them have been around for decades\nThese chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware coating on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\nPee fast is also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers and the million\nHow harmful to people can be chemicals be what kinds of problems to that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say the pastors are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel shade or she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute pee\nFast chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer\nLow birth weight\nThyroid disease\nElevated cholesterol and effects on the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the u._s. but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes ending twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals\nIt's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand in an Olympic size swimming pool and some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like ... America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher crack at is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his needs a clear direction from the EPA and from policymakers\nTo be able to explain to the public and my above or below a safe level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and that still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined as soon as possible\nNow the EPA is working on a plan to manage pee fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nThe Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding\nDifferently today is an issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water\nAlso we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage pretty fast chemicals and we don't know what that plan is going to look like until it's out sometime in the next few months\nSo what could people do to protect themselves today\nWell the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink\nIf you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pictures those will bring the levels down too but I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water That's NPR's Jeff Brady thanks thank you

treatment for his ... and depression NPR's Quil Lawrence covers veterans and the VA and he joins us now like well how are the tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight a he's a lawyer he was a former Missouri secretary of state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and then came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly good run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this ad Andres in Kansas\nSenator boy and he's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling a are Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun supports gun rights but he also support background checks he says to keep terrorists from getting one of these\nAnd then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says says I'd like to see somebody to do this and the ad gone national attention\nHe later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician of the Democratic\nParty and his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and it came with a very uh honest and emotional letter message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in ... in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in

Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because a prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows at trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things of that the state six to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate signing self and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I\nThink if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia are delusional lawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murdered\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial
