the would be bomber or mystery Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\n...\nThe death of journalists ... has strained ties between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and its stirred up rivalries in the middle east between the Saudis the Iranians and the Turks\nTurkey has been strategic and dominating the narrative and earlier today NPR's Deb Amos told me that Turkey's president isn't just trying to gain an advantage over the Saudis\nHe also is playing his hand to improve relations with the U.S at its they've been terrible over the past year on a variety of issues um but you know Istanbul Ankara is working with Washington on this particular event and the pressure comes at a time that the Saudis and the Turks are on\nDifferent sides of this regional cleavage and it goes to this question about how majority Muslim countries are governed they favor Islamist activists for example the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis the UAE eat the Egyptians they hate those people are they put them in jail\nAnd so for for turkey ... it is good for them to see the Saudi leadership in some ways shaking their reputations question because it is good for turkey as a regional leader\nYou know in the U.S policymakers are so focused on the divide between Saudi Arabia and Iran um how has around played into this\nStory if at all oh they've been very quiet um and in the first two weeks said nothing I'm only in the past couple of days have we began to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThen on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how in the century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weak and they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and when I think about the Trump Administration\nUh and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the answer to their conflict with Iran and away right I mean the Saudis backed president when he pulled out of the Obama era nuclear agreement with Iran um what does it mean for Washington's or on policy\nThat question has reportedly been part of the White House calculation as the whole story unfolds here is why Saudi Arabia is critical to the Trump plan to squeeze Iranian oil imports\nIf you take a rainy an oil imports off the market and that is exactly what the Trump Administration wants to do you could drive up oil prices gas prices in the United states if you don't find a way to fill that gap\nThat's what Saudi will offer they are the only oil producer that has spare capacity and they have said that they will make up\nAny deficit in a rainy and crude and cheap oil prices steady now so far\nOr Saudis energy minister has said this is exactly what they're going to do they're going to open those taps this all begins on November fifth\nAnd November fifth what's the significance of that date November fifth is when the U.S sanctions go into effect that is when it will become very difficult for the Iranians to sell any of their oil on the global market That's NPR's Deb Amos thanks so much for explaining it thank you\nWhat\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it

for lifetime income dot org\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish ten suspicious packages had been intercepted so far packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now and this story has put the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies looking to the city of miles either\nWe don't know anything yet about who deliver these packages of what's known so far but how they were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted\nAt this point we know that at least seven of the ten packages were handled by the postal service or the packages addressed for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service and two of the packages addressed a Joe Biden were also found and postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because the U. S. P. S. has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like this\nWhen it comes to mail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening\nProcedures so it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance maybe most importantly is who that package is going to if you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance\nI it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facility to check for suspicious looking items so these suspicious items that we're talking about a period of ... or ... cents using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nOr at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with that can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a wind going through their own mail\nOn the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have caused can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they the the U.S Postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective\nA specifically when it comes to investigations um they open Nineteen investigations into a hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being I'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions or in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics or is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nUh not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now I talk with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials and the media members in the case of CNN who seemed to have been targeted by\nThese packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who were carrying patch pointed to point B were also in danger in these situations uh if you remember back to two thousand one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers or who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are gonna be changed but we're definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's Miles Parks thanks so much thank you\nTo another story now about methamphetamine which is making a comeback addiction to the potent drug first became a crisis in many small towns in the early Nineteen nineties Smith use was leader eclipse by opioid addiction\nAs Frank Morris of member station K.

good food and it was a nice little town there's just a lot of drag\nLocally produced methamphetamine too cold here in the late eighties smearing generations of residents like ...\nStarted using

says he's been ... for years maintains that many here art in ... the school social worker and cue and backs them up\nA high number of our kids are affected by drug use and the home or mom and dad have less because they're out using\nWhen we're says grandparents are raising many of those kids but in some families myth now spends three generations\nA lot of times we're teaching our children how to survive you had everything that goes with the drugs like ... like a safety shelter\nAs I mentioned theft prostitution and currently an outbreak of hepatitis a here it's a familiar story in southeast Missouri and other parts of rural America Matthew stepped early this decade when lawmakers cut access to key ingredients but ... says it was about the same time that opioids took root here\nNow that they're hammering out on the opiates guess what's happening now the methods to live back in that myth is surging across the country usage methamphetamine\nNationally is that an all time high Eric Smith is assistant special agent in charge of the drug Enforcement Administration Kansas City office\nIt is back with a vengeance and the reasons for that or to fall number one the product is now produced cheaper and number two it's produced at a much higher potency level\nIs because most ... no longer comes from small home labs Danny whiteley police chief in Poplar Bluff Missouri says cheap high quality imports have flooded the market\nNinety nine percent of the methamphetamine is coming in now is coming in as crystal meth or ice that's being made by the super labs from in Mexico they make the staff and fifty gallon drums\nMissouri highway patrol sergeant mark the Clinton says Mexican drug cartels are getting that math to places and people didn't reach before\nI Would say that the math problem has basically exploded across every race and social economic class that you can imagine\nA drug post isn't keeping pace and you can see that at one of the busiest storefronts in downtown poplar\nBluff [noise]\nSoutheast Missouri behavioral health where uninsured meth users take a backseat to people using oh\nYeah absolutely harder to get treatment\nMark ward low rents this clinic and he says public funding prioritizes treating opioid addiction\nMethods doing a lot of damage and individuals are turning to use math instead of other substances whereas they might have chose opioids in the past but people are dying from opioids not man\nThey will not overdoses are actually on the rise but the drug isn't killing people and the numbers opioids are and I'm like ... there's no substitute medication the conditions can use to wean people off meth\nDestined secrets that's beside the point\nThe problem is is the addiction and it doesn't matter until they figure out why people want to get high and used drugs it's always going to be something\nElse in southeast Missouri heart drug addiction started with Matt and many here say the rolling catastrophes caused should serve as a warning to places where method is spreading now NPR News I'm Frank Morris [noise]\nAnd so the way he figures that out is he takes the actual votes that people cast and then election so like\nAll the votes that north Carolinians cast in the congressional race in twenty twelve\nAnd then he calculates how many seats Democrats and Republicans would have one if the district maps have been just a little bit different and he does this thousands of times with thousands of nonpartisan alternative redistricting schemes and then fees you know well how different is my you know quote unquote average result from what we actually saw\nAnd what he found for example in that twenty twelve congressional race is North Carolina elected for Democrats to Congress and twenty twelve\nBut Jonathan saw actually more typical result would have been six or seven Democrats so now you can look at that map and say you know what that map elected for Democrats it's unusual it's a typical and I'm able to quantify that\nSaid that that's what he set out to do is really key finding but it was actually something else that really surprised on it then when he did all of this um let him explain it I saw\nElse has to buy never changing a single vote\nBy only redrawing the districts I could change the number of Democrats elected from four to nine to Thirteen and we would consider each of those you know we call it a wave election either does write and extremes but with the same boat you can create a wave election for the Republicans and a wave election for the Democrat\nSo that that's kind of amazing Johnathan is looking at an election where the votes are unchanged one set of votes but depending on how he moves those district lines around she can create an election that's a landslide for the Republicans or a landslide for the Democrats that is how powerful gerrymandering as\nSoon as this mathematicians who's going to court with the stuff\nThat is correct so last October this mathematician Jonathan mattingley with an expert witness in a court case he actually took the stand on behalf of those North Carolina voters who were suing the state over the map and its goal is to try to convince the federal judges that hey just this map is gerrymandered\nAnd have a vet bill for a while we're hoping that you'll listen to the epicenter of this is a team led a cliffhanger or you

arrested a fifty six year old Florida Man and charged him with mailing the thirteenth potentially explosive devices to prominent Democrats and critics of Donald Trump\nNPR's Miles parks reports the arrest of Caesar say all comes after three more packages were found today\nTeachers say Iraq is charged with interstate transportation or an explosive illegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents threatening interstate communications and assaulting federal officers he faces up to forty eight years in prison if he's convicted according to the Justice Department\nSays along criminal record according to public data including a charge related to a bomb threat in the early to thousands President Trump spoke about sex arrest saying quote these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country he said we must never allow political violence to take root in America Miles Parks NPR News\nAsked again by the media today about whether his own rhetoric has anything to do with a man accused of sending bombs through the mail President Trump's largely brushed off the comments after noting it appears to suspect there's an ardent supporter of the President Trump said he himself bears no blame president also doubled down on his recent criticisms of the media's coverage of his administration\nWell I think I don't like it really does enough because as you know the media really unfair to me and the Republican Party I think the media is very very unfair reserves of the Republican Party and the ways we govern Trump's\nRemarks come as he has to Charlotte North Carolina for a political rally it was a consummate grew impressive three point five percent of the third quarter but that positive report from the Commerce Department did not change the outlook on Wall street today we're stocks continue to struggle Here's NPR's already Berliner\nConsumers powered the economy and the third quarter boosting their spending on everything from durable goods like washing machines to restaurant meals and clothing I spent more on health care to the economy was also boosted by an increase in federal spending notably on defense\nThe upbeat report on the economy was not enough to help the sell off and financial markets disappointing results from Amazon and Google's parent alphabet soured the mood as we came to a close\nAnd it's not just those two tech giants Internet companies that drove the market higher in recent years are now leading the decline re Berliner NPR News\nBecause of those drops Microsoft has regained which purchased the second most valuable company in the U.S that's after a disappointing earnings report by online retailer Amazon sent back company stock lower wiping out roughly sixty five billion and market capitalization Microsoft has also lost some ground but fell by a smaller amount\n... some thousand migrants has traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now that has no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants and asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nI Do think it as a permanent shift if us working class Americans or why their incomes have stagnated the\nTwo answers they give our immigration and trade and so a lot more people have come to see immigration and not always a cultural shift but as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode\nIs that again that catastrophic tunes for using about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April or some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people are and the idea that this is some existential threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually\nGoing into mid terms what is the Democratic reply to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such tried and only\n... I think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focus on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base of the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for they are constantly accused of being for open borders\nAnd when you look at all of the immigration bill saver voted for it they call for ... and and with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and it's a Ferrari water or as I Am in ten days right I mean right but the the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and\nThis is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics healthcare a and to the issues and a lot of voters are voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead\nA that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think can integrate many house races to\nDavid to Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking\nAbout that yeah it gets and credibly stupid idea\nDonald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy a big change in American identity or he plays on cultural or any of the issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we you know we Obamacare it gives you protection for insurance for pre existing conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly culturally Desi critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in the times like this have you ... the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump's stance EJ last hard minute to you\nI think that yeah the voters disagree with tape it that the if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues\nHealth care and the economics ranked one to or to one or in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about\nA lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending uh being open for example or to refugees and the way the Trump Administration is not but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was\nA this week and it seems to be working pretty well for

bombs continue to surface\nThe suspect fifty six year old says are say op faces a variety of federal charges including threatening a former president FBI Director Christopher Wray says ... was found on one of the packages and his DNA into other's race says the package is contained improvised explosive devices\nThat we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nWell authorities say say I appear to be a political parties and they stress that it is premature to speculate on a possible motive at the White House President Trump welcome the arrest while giving thanks to law enforcement\nThese people have worked so hard and to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done and incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate\n[noise] as\nThe investigation proceeded we've heard mixed messages from the president NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to talk more about that had their Scott ... so the president spoke about the arrest today at a White House event celebrating a young black leaders what tone did he take\nIt was a tough tone you said there's no place for political violence in our country he condemned what appears to be an effort to sow fear among Americans and as we've done earlier in the week when a flurry of these packages surface the president made an appeal for national unity\nWe show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens there is no country like our country is an everyday we are showing the world just how truly great we are\nThis was a conventional message the kind of thing you'd expect to hear from President at a time like this and yet the words do get sort of special attention because President Trump is typically so unconventional\nA lot of critics have pointed out this week that the president himself vilified Democrat trade 'em that he's been known to celebrate violence was there any feedback from those targeted by the suspect\nAs a matter of fact a former President Obama happen to be campaigning for Democrats in Wisconsin today and he suggested that Trump's calls for national unity ring a little bit hollow\nI'm hoping your finger while\nYears months vilify the questioning their patriotism calling them enemies\nIn the paper and then suddenly you're concerned about civility [noise]\nPlease and Trump himself some sort of mixed messages today hours before sucks arrest the president was tweeting a complaining that the nonstop media attention being paid to these suspected by bombs was taking the focus away from politics and cutting into what he said was Republican momentum\nYou know with this all happening just before the election right eleven days away which of these messages do you think the president will be leading harder on in the coming they\nYou know that's what we are going to be watching to see earlier this week at a campaign rally in Wisconsin Trump self consciously dial back is more partisan rhetoric saying he was trying to be nice\nBut as he left the White House tonight for another political rally in North Carolina he suggested it might be about time to take the gloves off again I've been toned down Trump said I could really counted up\nThat's NPR's Scott Horsley Scott thanks so much\nGood with you meanwhile President Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and\nAre are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America moved north towards the border us border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi ... hey Ari\nOn T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWill the fears really suppressing reality the size of the Honduran Caribbean as reportedly dropped by half from some southern thousand thirty five hundred known expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nLet me just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary cures to Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border they could be shot at\nWinning cannot have any attention right now to ... to people and they will be apprehended however uh but I also take my office or an agent or at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they have the ability of course and defend the house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico as she killed ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land you got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know when will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back so I was told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n... we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally to Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that [noise]\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum immigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior andme\nAt least thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\n[noise] President Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nRight the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president has attempted what he attempted to travel ban and then he'll give it's his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John [noise]\nOne of the funniest rose I just love the
