Paris\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is heading to North Korea tonight hoping to set up a second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong noon today he met with Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe's reassuring him the Tokyo's concerns won't be forgotten\nBut am I influenced by that sure I'm a human being like he's when being like all of us are\nAnd and as you know other human beings are many of them women are reacting very differently to this day are bringing forward experiences that they have had\nWhere they have been assaulted I'm physically in some cases threatened with assault and their reactions to it are also very important then one of the reasons we ... we are interested in as I said earlier kind of the fallout from this and the kinds of divisions that have been laid bare in this do you think\nThat people's personal reactions are guiding that response to this or do you think it's something else even among your colleagues\nI'm quite sure that personal reactions are guiding lots of people on this just because that is human nature I Can't speak any particular person uh but uh uh it it's surprising that this would be so I don't I don't think it should be condemned but again if you're asking\nSomebody to maintain complete composure\nUm and I think you're expecting something that is too much to expect of of normal people occasionally again you could have someone who does keep his cool under such extraordinary circumstances but I think that's the exception rather than the rule and I think if you're asking about judicial temperament a much better guide for judicial temperament is\nHow a judge Kavanaugh behaved in about ten years more than ten years on the DC circuit bench and everybody seems to say that his temper but it's been excellent\nThere I'll catch a professor you know the defendants are accused of terrible things all the time that they may or may not have done and they are not allowed to behave this way I mean a criminal defendant who presented himself in court or herself\nWho was accused of something terrible that he or she did not do would not be allowed to scream at people would not be allowed to be patronize thing and condescending toward the judge\nOr toward other parties\nOr if I were a member of a jury and somebody was on the stand accused of effects could be anything else\nI and I saw him are reacting in anger when questioned by the prosecutor and interrupting say the prosecutor\nI I'd like to think I wouldn't hold that against him of course I'd look at the evidence I'd want to know if he's guilty uh but uh uh I Would say if he behaves anger lead that anger is not inconsistent with innocence and it's not a fine of bad character is a sign of someone who is reacting to very very serious accusation\nLet me go back to the question of the legal community um it I I Do you agree that this is a an episode on on what else to call it I don't mean to minimize it by calling it that a a a moment that has risen\nYour a profession one of the things she noted in your blog post is that a lot of people disagree with you people who've respect they disagree you disagree with other people whom you respect and that you've had a lively dialogue about it has this been a notable moment for your profession and why do you think that is\nWell a yes of course it's notable this is something that's very high profile about a very important matter a people sharply disagree on this of course the legal academy is overwhelmingly liberal\nAnd uh and as you pointed out a war one that's coming from it colors ones perception and are just as conservatives are predisposed to respond one way to such things liberals and other way so it's surprising that there would be a lot of uh she'd coming from kind of a part of one's political reaction\nBut also or just in even people who are not particularly partisan I feel very strongly about this because it's in the news or a and because it is about somebody who will be a very important to a bigger in legal life for decades to come\nThat is Eugene Volokh he is the Gary ... professor of law at the UCLA school of law and he's the co founder of the vote conspiracy blog which is hosted at reason professor Volokh thanks so much for talking to us\nAnd thank you so much for having\n[noise]\nAli Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed\nDecision with all the facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she did want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford by ms Ramirez and by others\nWho would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously\nDemocrats or showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to\nThat they don't like about like ... ... far western area in China as well as Tibet and Taiwan and so there are certainly a feeling that some scholars do sell censor in order to get visas others are very brave and and are willing to not be able to get visas to go in\nSo one more question for us as you know is very focused on Russian influence in elections and a Russian efforts to interfere with us all elections when it comes to undermining confidence in democracy particularly let's say in the United states which country is the bigger concern Russia or China or I think Russia has\nBeen very overt about it I think China what's concerning about China is that it's much more of a challenge it also would like do undermine\nThe message of the United states which is freedom and democracy\nThe difference being that Russia does not have a business plan it's a relatively small compared to China in terms of economy China's an enormous economy getting very close to surpassing ours in the future\nAnd they're also a much more sophisticated and will run country and so I think it's a much much greater challenge but these days because of what happened in two thousand and sixteen election this is what we focus on which is Russia\nThat NPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt visiting with us here in Washington DC Frank thank you so much happy to do it\n[noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWe're going to turn now to a developing story prominent Saudi journalist Jamal ... has been missing for days now the Washington Post is reporting that he was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAccording to the post Turkish investigators say the murder was carried out by a Fifteen member team from Saudi Arabia and was pre planned Jamal ... he writes for the Washington Post global opinion section\nIn a moment we'll hear from current AT T a global opinion editor at the post but first we're going to play a bit of our conversation with them because she'll be back in may after the Saudi Government led by crown prince Mohammed bin ... month crackdown on activists\nBut I think the research he's

just continue to the future I don't need anybody just hope\nIs it possible that this was reflective of some kind of a power struggle\nNo no uh it was about ... over to the group that old and he has no one to challenge who's ...\nAnd the Washington Post ... ... is with us now is a tiff thank you so much for speaking with I'm Sorry about why we're talking but thank you for coming [noise] I think he fattening they would have turkey said about what happened to Mr ...\n[noise] um yeah and indeed our going on what a Turkish sources have been telling reporters since ... I'm\nMissing a turkey has a pretty much consistently said that they believe he was still in the consulate\nToday than is is that they are believed that Jamal was killed and and the conflict the Turkish authorities office said today that they know a a diplomatic praying carrying a team of Fifteen or so Saudi officials came in on Tuesday the same day that the law\nAnd to the conflict and and left that day\n... do we know what Mr ... was at the consulate\nYeah we know that he was there to marry his fiance had gone to the conflict in the previous friday actually can file on some papers in order to get properly married a fiance Turkish and he was told to leave and come back the following me and when he came back on Tuesday\nHe never came out on his fiance as as so reporters that she waited out there for twelve hours on and he never came out\nHow has Saudi Arabia responded to or explained his disappearance\nSo far the Saudis have denied holding him they said he left the constantly on friday they said that he left outside of outdoor but I have not provided any evidence for that no cameras no nothing so far the official line is that he left the country and disappeared\nBefore we conclude you just remind us why Mr ... was in self imposed exile from Saudi Arabia because you just remind us about why that is\nWhat people need to know and understand that because he has been almost a household name and in Saudi Arabia for almost Thirty years yeah in fact the overall advisor to the or a family\nWith increasing crackdown on dissent on you just saw a lot of his friends and and ah associates rounded up and so he fled um to avoid that faith for himself\nAnd so yes so with the post he was writing you know critical pieces a about um Mohammed bin ... about the Saudi authorities however he never wanted to be this incident he really honestly love\nSaudi Arabia he really honestly and some of these pieces even took on it advisor role and felt that MPs should take the right path and do the right thing to set his country back on track I honestly believe that\nThat is ... global opinion editor at the Washington Post ... thank you so much for talking with us and we'll keep a good thought think summer and\nThis is NPR News support comes from D.
