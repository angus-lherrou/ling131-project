P. Morgan CEO Jamie diamond still expected to attend you know they've been are vying for lucrative role in the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco which is the world's largest\nOil company and so that's a lot at stake here I'm also by the way a treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin is also expected to attend\nAlright so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there are several Wall Street will be there what about Congress where what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales to produce jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy [noise] situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much thanks\nMatter with President Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here so [noise] so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hikes\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing in a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them from using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks\nAnd others drawing him I'm so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see an economic riskier given\nWho the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the marriage that could could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome also thank you for having me on [noise]\nYou're listening to all

important to me it's not much I'm a student and I work a lot I just want to be\nGive back to something that gets to the community so much\nYou know any amount really makes a huge difference when you get to Colorado Public Radio's so whenever I hear a listener say it's not\nMuch I'm kind of humbled by that because it\nDoesn't really matter how much they are giving but the fact that they decided to gives and support this service I mean that\nAlone to me it's a pretty powerful statement so if you want to join and get Colorado Public radio right now because this is listener supported CPR news couldn't do it without you shut your support at CPR dot org or one eight hundred for nine six one five three zero\nRight and I you know you hear a lot about people um who had been waiting to give and maybe they feel a little bit guilty or in that case you know somebody who thinks they're not quite giving enough but but this was Colorado Public radio and that means that\nThis is about you know students who are low income household that they can't usually access to the news and we're trying to be here for everybody it's not for some particular group of people it's public\nAnd when you give to Colorado Public radio you are basically under writing that promise that this service is going to be accessible\nFor everyone and until I don't know like the ... right [laughter] that's the goal that's the goal so if you're thinking about this uh ten dollars a month is a really good amount to think about this gets you the option for a pair of lovely CPR socks this was a new fund thank you gift\nThat we're offering during this membership drive you can check them out at CPR dot O. R. G. or or college to give at one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nAnd one of the really cool things about giving to Colorado Public radio right now is that sure you're supporting your own listening habits but you're also getting for those who aren't able to get to CPR right now for whatever reason you make the coverage possible\nAnd Malik high Haynes joins me from Colorado State university where he's now a freshman high Malecon Hi how's it going for having\nMe yeah it's going well and congratulations this is a huge national award from the boys and girls clubs of America I'm I'm curious about your relationship with that organization I think it dates back to when you were six on first joined it what what attracted you\nA watt first what am I fix birthday I'm a school that I was going through how to after school program a partnership with the ... so ... wasn't goes could walk to school and then while kids back to the boy that goes with every day so my friends and going there on the rest of schools don't there's I just figured if I go to try to you\nAnd what kept you going\nOh I'd probably say as a young kid just the opportunities that fund their um try new things whether is playing sports are doing educational games or just getting to meet new friends or whether it was a place that I felt welcome there\nI understand that early on your mom came to pick you up and had a hard time even finding you what were you were you doing\nYeah this is my first day there and um she came to pick me up and we're actually paying us staffers this kid does well game and I was a small person that goes up and my ... birthday [noise] um so I was only ... left in the game\nAnd so I happen to hit the last staff member there to win the game for the kid and other kids came running onto the basketball court replaying dodge ball and I found out what might have been calling me to the ... for about ten or Fifteen minutes she wasn't too happy with\nThat [laughter] but it must be very nice day for you fast forward quite a few years and you won this award largely for setting up a reading program for the younger kids in the club or we heard just a little bit about it in the introduction how did it work\nOut well I actually started because I was in the program in my high school so we had to do community service project so I figured what better way than doing 'em up whether it goes from there every day for me when my friends that I Know if you get we found five kids\nWho are really reading at least two to ... below the crane grade level on which is kind of surprising to me so we just figured that we're going to go in there we're going to be with there for four hours\nUm every Friday they are going to come to the best students that did not work so we figured that we have to ask the kids but they need it from us to help them out so whether that included pizza or playing football with them playing basketball with them\nI was just developing those relationships to get there that want to read with us it was a really worked for I Swear\nPizza that sounds like you're bribing them to read I suppose there are worse things yeah bride kids for a this is called double trouble reading program\nYes why did you call a double trouble\nAlso at first it wasn't called double trouble but then when we started playing basketball or football with the kids read read it for what our and then play and they eat pizza for another hour or so we've got the name of that will shovel\nOkay said the national award makes you the use of the year for the boys and girls clubs of America you get a twenty five thousand dollar scholarship to renewable for four years and I have to think that this award is based partly on the results of the reading program did it make a difference\nUm I Would like to think so just because all those kids were in the reading program came in reading at a second grade reading level there in the fifth grade and then each one of them improved by well at least one where you live with end of the six week period\nThough and that scholarship that's going to get you through the su I guess I'm going to see\nRight now is going to give me through college um debt free\nThanks for being with us Malecon from traveling\nMalecon Haynes of Aurora a freshman at sea su and national youth of the year for the boys and girls clubs of
