to have killed eleven worshipers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie ... which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe him as very quiet very isolated you lived alone he seemed to watch television in the night he used PO box or not the sort of a mailbox at his apartment which is just south of synagogue [noise]\nBut I spoke to a friend of his has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm Robert powers as a child was very smart but also seem to really struggle with social cues and the two of them were friends and they would play together they would build things together they would take things apart [noise]\nThey would build bombs together as sort of pranks and blow up watermelons but as\nTime went on the two of them sort of grew apart and rubber powers became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just disappear and it's not clear if he graduated and it's not clear to the man what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a dose like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building about twenty five minutes south of the synagogue\nAnd that people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name and that he was pretty much a ghost she would come and go\nAnd sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much it\n[noise] and there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year she spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nNeeded a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like mine get community\nOn Gabrielle usual media network that has become more popular among All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are unwelcome in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president and didn't escape his anger\nAnd he seemed to think that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals then Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed Hughes hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think the ban is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks of the next couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did he become as hateful as he did and how long I've been going on and what role did the Internet playing [noise]\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nKind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much thank you\nPresident Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears are you sure Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nShe's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know first\n... ... the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what I Am more than she does and I have no\nAnswers that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe ... the death toll passed Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers in indiscriminate attacks so that many of the radical Muslims have\nCarried out and when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that is this the new face of extreme is\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media to Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments in the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAre always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they steady terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk what\nAre the characteristics of an individual that allow them to go from non violence in support of one of these ideologies to violence we find that the believing in this collective sense of ... is in your necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in a way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level a Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here\nI'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail but there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell a who will act in who's just ranting we're\nGoing to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ranch but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nThat type of your national security correspondent Greg Myre thanks ... thanks sorry\nBefore Robert ... hours walked into the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and allegedly gun down lending people he posted I'm going in on his social media account this was an account on dad a social network that prides itself on being censorship\nFree gab has since gone dark but the company says it's working around the clock to get back on line\nTo talk more about how gab has created a space for white supremacists and other extremist views we turn now to Joan Donovan she said he's media manipulation ... data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me\nYou're somebody who's been monitoring ... for a while now before it was taken down how do people on dad react to the synagogue shooting\n[noise] there was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy were saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally\nTour but again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check Mart from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you or NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gap CEO Andrew tour but\nAbout ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going in\nWhat you expected to do it like that you want to censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or a beach harbor you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with trolls cereal harasser as\nPeople generally opt out not many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app store is they've all cut ties with gab and yet gathered in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend how likely is that well\nI Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as supporters\nYou swipe left it's not so many are interested in and if you swipe right than you are interested in if they're interested as well then you connect [noise] these or snap decisions oh no bad shoes wrinkle shirt now my type it's a very rapid fire like ...\nThat swipe was a key feature of tender which launched first then in early tender employee who

similar\nMatch the parent company of tinder is suing bumble for almost every type of IP infringement you could think of\nSarah Bernstein is a professor at the University of Oklahoma College of law and by IP she means intellectual property tinder has patent and trademark covering the way it works but bumble has counter suit and called those IP claims bogus you\nDon't own the concept of swiping rights or swiping left you don't own the concept of matchmaking and there's a lot\nOf money at stake Forbes values bumble it over a billion dollars in tinder is worth even more so tender didn't invent matchmaking or swiping but Kennedy owned the idea of swipe based dating apps\nIt turns out that's a complicated question and it raises much bigger issues patents are supposed to cover specific inventions they aren't supposed to cover abstract ideas Daniel ... is a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier foundation\nSays you don't get a patent for saying cure to mentor with a drug you have to say what the drug use\nThen along came the Internet and people discovered they can patent some pretty abstract ideas as long as they added a computer like you couldn't ... the idea of meal planning

software\nThat changed four years ago a company called the Alice corporation had some abstract online banking patents and the Supreme Court threw them out the court ruled that an abstract idea plus the computer is still an abstract idea\nNeither says the Alice decision could be bad news for tender if tenders patent is just the abstract idea of matchmaking but online that's no longer allowed but did I mention that it's complicated\nWhat is abstract is itself pretty obstruction challenging question\nYou can patent software your idea just has to be an innovation so of course tinder says that swiping to match people was unique in innovative\nThe slaves fight is still working its way through the courts but in the meantime it's clear the Supreme Court's decision tightened the rules for software patterns which has had a big impact way beyond the dating industry Naser argues it's been a positive change promoting healthy competition but others worry that good patents\nAre being thrown out as well Michael Risch is a professor at Villanova university's law school\nIf you apply the definitions courts used it for a strict many of our most famous um would wind up being on and like the telephone\n... says this push and pull it goes right to the heart of patent law\nIs a sort of internal tension we have between trying to get the right not too broad and walk to narrow but really

President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either\nOur first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office was you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately referred to matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this reporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of a earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down an individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with Mueller in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working at\nThe OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make of the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nAh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped

donate to this NPR station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I know that Chang Saturday shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to them on a Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome thank you it's great to be here\nAnd we'll start with a very basic question but it's a question that's bill confound me wiring Jews such a focus for white nationalist\n[noise] you know for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of whiteness as superior\nAnd a real intention to maintain that kind of superiority folks on on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how to transfer between people\nBut also on institutional on a national level through our politics I'm to the way that we talk about documentary history onto the way that we manage our institutions and it's an effort to maintain power\nAnd to keep people who are different um marginalized 'em and separated in in our community\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white nests in much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh\nEighty to Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background to white nationalist or you know are Jewish community here in the United states already comes from immigrant backgrounds are to come from backgrounds have strong ethnic identity when we came to this country\nAnd all we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white and as we're both elevated in celebrated in this country as far as our history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of Jews different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threats\nPeople of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate\nFrom those who have more skinned privilege because their skin presents later or whiter and then in contrast we think about the hatred and Jews and if we assume that most user white in this country than we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identities suit\nSee something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but if there's something different about it now\nWhat's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional positions that have traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic you think that's new\nI think when we have our policy makers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes of stocked\nAnd using fear to marginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different and the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified\nSo what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employees\nTo combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember\nIs that white nationalism and designed to marginalize all of us and so this is the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together could develop friendships and trust and relationships so that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marking down our streets\nThat we know each one of us are going to come out of our houses to support the other that we will not question who needs who needs a kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture as a as a as a as a as a nation and out of the people\nThat is our most important strategy right now\n... is director of the use of color field building initiative thank you very much for joining us today Thanks so much for its imitation was my privilege\nThe notorious Boston gangster James Whitey Bolger is dead at the age of eighty nine he was killed in federal prison in West Virginia\nBolger rose to power the Nineteen seventies while also serving as an

transferred to the hazel in federal prison in West Virginia last night he was placed in the general population but he didn't make it to roll call this morning and wouldn't authorities investigated they found Bolger it bent over\nA having been killed he suffered by the way nine heart attacks while in federal prison in Florida just before coming up here he was in a wheelchair and he had a bottle
