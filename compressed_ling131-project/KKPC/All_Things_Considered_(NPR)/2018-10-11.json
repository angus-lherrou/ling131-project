majority leader Mitch McConnell is sending a warning to voters with midterm elections now just twenty six days away he wants Republican to no control of Congress is not the only thing to stake\nLose the Senate and the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years of President Trump that I think is a scary prospect of the people who like what we've been doing on the judge Roger and I'll will help us hold on for a majority\nNow NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell sat down with Senator McConnell in his office in the Capitol today for a wide ranging discussion and she was with me now for a wide ranging discussion on everything that they discussed hey there Kelsey high there so senator\nMcConnell really sounding the alarm there for Republicans I'm how confident\nDid he tell you he is that they will keep their Senate majority come November\nWell I have to say he sounded much more upbeat than he did even just a month ago people may remember that earlier this year he said this and it was absolutely in play now the conversation we had didn't really sound like that he told me that the fight over cabin on um a justice Kevin\nCame drastic or right time even when he was downplaying the general Stanley or the tax reform message for Republicans\nAs of the last week or so the oddest issue in our Russia's has become the Kavanaugh nomination we've seen\nA surgeon at first among Republican voters we knew the Democrats were fired up they have been all year no question about that but what we now saying is that um the enthusiasm and energy on the Republican side comes close to matching\nThe Democratic side and given the states that were competing and that's really good news for us\nThat many times headed to an energized debates do you worry that that had come to quickly is that is that something sustainable Republicans now that they have Kavanaugh in this world they standardize and shut up\nActually comes right on the eve of the election I mean we're only
