portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nAre several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblet remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nSound the small end of a dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers in size which was about six or seven times smaller than what poodle is\nShepherd is an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know immediately when we find an object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about order\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbit isn't even close to round like earth it's a very elongated ellipse next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun objects this far out with really elongated orbits are just weird\nThe current models of solar system formation don't predict these objects\nJuliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers thinkers out there\nIn easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system\nThe gravity of big planet like Jupiter or Neptune Ken sling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happened to wander by but the goblin doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging\nBecker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planning on so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nI guess I have kind of a ticker in my mind is how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful that like I the kicker in my mind just jumped up like where a lot closer to having enough objects\nCertainly the goblet

technique used in laser eye surgery which I badly needs who I'm very grateful to you um when that paper came out this was your first scientific paper ever right\nThat's right so in the simplest way you can ... can you explain to all of us is jerked polls amplification\nUh actually it was done in radar we didn't realize that you know during World War two so it was quite a few years before we did it again in optics but it is the idea that if you really want to a huge a force on something like an electron electric field you need a the\nTake power and peak powers energy per unit time and at the time of\nA CPA invention\nYou could have either big energy lasers or you could have short pulse lasers but if you put a short pulse through\nThis enormous the electric field actually destroyed the

are learning that their drinking water is polluted with a potentially harmful group of chemicals\nThey're called pee fast P. F. I. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster NPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Jeff Hi Ari first of all what are these chemicals\nA pie fast it's an entire group of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like non stick cookware holdings on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\n... also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers and the million\nHow harmful to people can be chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say the pastors are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel ... she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute\nPee fast chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer\nLow birth weight\nThyroid disease elevated cholesterol and effects on the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the U. S. but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now\nAnd how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals it's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand in an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher crooked is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his needs clearer direction from the EPA and from power\nThe makers to be able to explain to the public and my above or below sea level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and\nThat still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined as soon as possible\nNow the EPA is working on a plan to manage pee fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nThe Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding\nDifferently today is an issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage pretty fast chemicals\nAnd we don't know what the plan is going to look like until it's out sometime in the next few months\nSo what could people do to protect themselves today\nWell the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink\nIf you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pictures those will bring the levels down too but I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water\nThat's NPR's

this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Donald Trump has described himself for decades as a self made billionaire claiming that he built his fortune using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success was central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler\nAnd the story reveal schemes the Trump family used to avoid gift and the state taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws rest Buettner is one of the reporters who wrote the story welcome to all things considered Thanks Ari\nHow did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father over the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred and Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump's set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first just to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns related both to Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities we had general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one sprawling article and I'd like to tell me about one of them\nYou're right about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and installed refrigerators and other appliances improper to use it for Trump owned\nIn practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all county looks like a\nCompany you know when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper\nFred Trump had always negotiated personally the prices for the things he bought boilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety to ... bills for those items began being invoice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county within voice it get the money and then they would create another envoys to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then doing\nFred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split between Fred Trump's for surviving children who are the owners of All right ...\nThat's right and they were performing no work for that the only work was done by an employee Fred Trump's who is also a nephew of his ... employees secretary who handled these buildings things are among her other tasks\nFor Trump give gifts to all of his children but Donald you write in more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against his son Donald us Fred Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia\nDonald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by his creditors and he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings he was doing this he just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and but the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge and a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and Donald we wouldn't have any more control or input over the state than any of his other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace and then the case\nThere were audits there's evidence that Trump's didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me are the New York times story you just heard about says the trumps were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so real estate companies\nSuch as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is talk spawning as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving the versions that are in the ... side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades has simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating at tort gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat appears to me that the state department of finance has an utterly asleep at the wheel heart decades when it comes to a transactions on on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth than twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nAggressive you'd be surprised she says will I Will but there's something I Need to tell us or such a dumb well she was\nMission but it's come back and now it's

would prefer to control Congress Democrats or Republicans\nRight all year it's been true that Democrats have lead on this question to continue to lead on this question but only by six points now that's been cut in half\nIn the past month and guess what all of that movement in in the past week has been among men just in the past week those men have gone from being evenly split on whether they'd vote for a Republican or Democrat in their district and now saying they prefer Republican by ten points\nWomen on the other hand give Democrats at twenty points advantage that something that

today than it did a month ago\nI think absolutely that's one take away and I think that there there have been warning signs for Democrats that that the blue wave wasn't going to be as big as it could

will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered\nThank you very glad to be with you\nTo begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum us so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have the mind is ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically is concerned between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nBut some of those services firms complained about labor shortages and the impact of us tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Wall street stocks finished higher today led by banks and some

of judge Brett Kavanaugh who wrote a letter in support of the Supreme Court nominee in August\nAnd now says he has changed his mind mark ... within the law school class of Nineteen Ninety along with Kavanaugh and he joins us now welcome to the program they keep her having me what do you think back to the late eighties when you have an hour in law school together what stands out to you\nWell it was an intense experience it's a small class of about a hundred and sixty people at that time at Yale Law we knew each other pretty well and uh the classroom experience and the social experience were both among the most intense of my life\nWhat was Kevin all like back in law school when you were students together\nWhen we were in law school a rat was like most people he was young energetic smart somebody that was interesting to talk to and hang around with a I never and this is important to say I never saw any of the behavior or anything like what's been alleged and I never heard stories about that\nYou're a Democrat what factored into your decision to sign a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee along with twenty two other classmates endorsing Kevin ... over the summer\nI Am a Democrat however my side lost an election and I'm certainly aware that Brett Kavanaugh does not agree with me on a number of legal and political issues but having lost an election the other side was not going to nominate somebody that I Would have chosen in that way\nAnd so you have to look at qualifications you have to look at experience and so I knew from my own experience with Brett that he was somebody that I liked but I called some people practice in front of the court that a court of appeals for the district of Columbia\nAnd they explained that he was a fair judge somebody who hire good clerks and wrote could opinions\nAnd so in part based on that I signed the letter\nAnd then what was it about last Thursday's hearing that prompted you to send a second letter just yesterday to the Senate Judiciary committee withdrawing or support\nI think it really has to do not so much with the allegations of Dr for given that we're still waiting for the FBI to report on that it has to do with the exchange he had with the senators which is a co equal branch of government\nAnd having civil discourse with the quick quote branches of government is something that we have to expect from the Supreme Court in particular it was the exchange with my own senator Amy club which are\nWrecked Kevin uh started by recognizing his or that he liked her that he had my work but then when she has to hard question he responded by throwing the question back at her\nThis was a question about his drinking\nThat's correct and he done that before with Senator Whitehouse or perhaps one other senator in ... there was something about that that was like a gut punch you know it was it was it was really disappointing no he did come back and apologize for that at least to center cobra char but that's something that is very hard to get over\nWhy do you consider that disqualifying\nLike I said because there are a expectations of the Supreme Court that they have to treat with respect to co equal branch of government they can't as we often hear irrigate the power to themselves and if he's going in with that kind of contempt ... equal branch it's deeply troubling\nI Know that you've been in touch with other classmates do you feel that your representative for more of an outlier\nI'm an outlier in two ways I mean I was outlier for signed a letter in the first place if it's only twenty three out of the hundred and sixty some members of the class scientists and the first place so that may be an outlier and certainly an outlier on with my Proctor and withdrawing from the letter [noise]\nUm so it's it's really only the two of us are among settled group who who did both things\nDo you still consider him a friend [noise] yes I I I Hope that we can have a friendship I'm I suspect he might be screened in my calls right now but uh I Hope not\nYale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor author now teaches law at the University of St\nThomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to have the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the ... inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary gifted Nielsen\nIt is important that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da chess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assistant after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the H. S. said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their\nKids at all since then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nVHS does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents [noise]\nOh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Jill you're walking [noise]\nAn even go to the point where one of the officials at the embassy\nSuggested that if this debate went ahead to the u._k. might get less favorable trade tons of to brag says Harwood was done it's just quite shocking that within an institution that was a hundred and Seventy five years old that prides itself on hosting free speech free exchange

foreign secretary was one of the speakers of the germ debate he didn't think much of China's alleged tactics\nI voted was pathetic it's something that the Chinese raised foolishly do again and again\nThey genius spent years trying to influence how the world talks about China and risking says when the country was much weaker it was easy to ignore\nWhen I was a foreign secretary I was involved in the final stages of the negotiations or the transfer to Hong Kong back to China a good one stage the Dalai Lama was going to be in the United kingdom and I told my office that I Would be very happy to see them on the spot or did they complain they said it was inappropriate\nBut nothing more than that happened\nBecause at that time they didn't have the diplomatic way to they have to de\n... says they were important reasons why China wants to frame it's global image measures that China scholar at Oxford University\nOne of the context for the obsessive way in which Chinese officials can sometimes think about the way that China is portrayed the seas is the fact that for the best part of a hundred and fifty years China was of course not in control of its and destiny\nIt was a period when foreign powers carved up China which the government calls the century of humiliation the government's recent economic boom changed all that\nThese days ... much better position to actually spread that narrative talk about itself in those terms\nWith we might say much loud to make a ... and that is creating some cognitive dissonance I thing for some parts of the American establishment which maybe for a long time so that democracy was not the only way that China could guys but the only way that any country could possibly go\nNow Chinese President Xi Jinping has gone

things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Donald Trump has described himself for decades as a self made billionaire claiming that he built his fortune using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success with central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler\nAnd the story reveal schemes the Trump family used to avoid gift and state taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws\n... one of the reporters who wrote this story welcome to all things considered thanks sorry\nHow did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father of the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite\nChild I Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first just to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here by\nThe time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns related both to Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities we had general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one sprawling article and I'd like you to tell me about one of them\nYou write about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and installed refrigerators and other appliances and properties that fed Trump owned\nIn practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all county looks like a\nYou know when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper Fred Trump always negotiated personally the\nPrices for the things he bought boilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety to ... bills for those items began being in voice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county within voice it get the money and then they would create another in voice to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then doing\nFred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split between Fred Trump's for\nChildren who are the owners of All right that's right and they were performing no words for that the only work was done by an employee of Fred Trump's who was also a nephew of his ... employees secretary who handled these buildings things are among her other tasks\nFor Trump give gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there is an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against is on Donald Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened that was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by who's creditors\nAnd he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings he was doing this you just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or employed over the state than any of those other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the\nTrump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties rushed Buettner is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us\nToday Thanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard it now says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAnd NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades has simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of right now so to the extent the IRS has resource as they're not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true with the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transaction some on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen but\nBecause Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it NYU's Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations", "year": "2018", "show_name":
