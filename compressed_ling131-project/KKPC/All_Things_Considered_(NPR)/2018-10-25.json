{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KKPC", "content": "Standard among war photographers understanding there is no playbook that everybody gets issued but I'm curious you mail photographers take that much sensitivity in advance\nI've been told that it's rare that people work the way I work that they take the time to be very respectful and to ask people\nHow they feel comfortable being photographed you know\nI also have to discuss nudity for example I was shooting maternal mortality recently in Somaliland and that's a very deeply conservative country in place and they're\nThe women you know they said okay if you photograph for example the baby coming out and I don't want my face or you have to cover or you know and they give me the rules and that's what I Do\nYou're making me think of a photograph that you took of a woman named AIPAC who's was she was raped during\nWar and South Sudan harassed by the time you met her she was very pregnant yeah as a result of that rape you spent several hours photographing her in a dress and then you thought you know from trying to show her belly her pregnancy effect checkpoint here\nDo we do this without close um and you know as you were photographing her showing her the images on your camera correct to make sure she understood what it looked like\nYeah and I also before I even approached her with sort of what I envisioned I went to Kimberley who was the woman who had sort of rescued her and given her the safe house and\nSaid you know does this seem insensitive how do you feel about this is this something that would be rude to ask and she said no absolutely not let's take this to her and see how she feels and so we went and sort of talk to her through it and before I even finish my son she had taken her dress often was like totally she completely understood\nAnd you know as a woman I haven't been raped but I I have been assaulted in Libya was groped repeatedly and I made a decision to talk about that very openly because I think\nYou know as a survivor it's important to try and strip away the stigma and I think different women feel comfortable revealing different things about themselves and some people do and some people don't and that's one thing I've learned over the years\nAnd I think with Iraq it was something she wanted to do she wanted to show what had happened to her to sort of talk about it it was part of her therapy and I think it's very important for me as a photographer to not make those rules for people and everyone has the right to decide how they want to portray himself you've\nTalked in past about what a huge advantage ... if anything to be female and a lot of the places where you're trying to work because as we're hearing you have access to half of the population that are male photographer might not have access to\nWhat I loved and that kind of surprised me and this book is you also get great shots of American women there's if there's a photo going here of a navy lieutenant in the nurse corps she's stationed in Helmand Province of an age as me okay she ... the shots describe or you've caught her in the ladies' room Amy\nI mean this is after a very intense ah I was on a medivac in bed and um they would bring wounded soldiers out an Amy was a navy nurse and so she was you know they're in the trauma hospital\nAnd so after a an intense night I sort of followed her back to the showers where the women go and I you know I was like I Want to just shoot what your life is like here and\nShe was completely like fun and open and got it\nShe's she's I should explain she's got shaving cream while they're up are lagging shaving which made me I look at it and I'm thinking why would you bother to shave and helmet [laughter]\nAfter all I can tell you why because as a woman who's worked in like a very male world and in a war zone for Twenty years I Do everything I can to still try and feel like a woman you know whether that means like sneaking eye liner on in the middle of Helmand or lipstick or\nPerfume I always carry perfume and my camera bag H its psychological because I have to sort of maintain some semblance of myself [laughter]\nYou're right they're shaving in the in the shower stall [laughter]\nYeah and that was the fun of photographing women in the military because it's like it was the first time that I actually had women to hang out with because for so many years it was just me or me and my colleague Elizabeth Rubin or me and whoever the only two women for miles [noise]\nThat's when the door you talking about her new book of love and war thank you

people in the caravan have already applied for asylum in Mexico\nReact in Mexicans are making processing these allegations but also provided legal advice counseling for the people that that in the cabinet if they\nCan just ... I mean it's not a person is that is a price for rich people hired Mike right they need to find\nAnd life and people now that running away from ... in that context of Huntington\nSo you're saying that there is a mix of both economic migrants and people who are seeking asylum because they fear of persecution in their home countries or fear violence do you have people in the caravan who are making it clear to you that they wish to go to the United states\nOr not they ... they ... through flat out they can't live in that fat not necessary in the U.S lazy in Mexico\nThere has been a lot of concern in the U.S about the numbers of people who might be trying to apply to asylum in the U.S has un agency are received any pressure from the Trump Administration to process people they're\nNot not that time that that are ... I think it's I think it can be very clear may have actually tree out he says in South and Mexican whining and my ... not going to get ... says\nYou have any ... like we are facing currently is that in the house and the Mexican government receive around almost six pounds and\nThey just ... and\nThese theyll be that would take you need to go see their Asian they they have I did not have as we ask them to see we have received\nThe end of September ... drinking fountain obligations\nUNH ER is identified kidnapping and other security risks is that something you're talking about that's a risk within the caravan or from outside of it\nI think I find a cat that we have nothing hyper fat the dangers I Love the fact that the Taliban is thank you may not\nLike we are advising people they used to be careful too lazy fired a group that they don't look I Know they might face I mean I Would have had it on their\nFats and they can be either ... or ... that set the stage\nUm as we mentioned we're catching you as you're traveling along this group was there any a person or family that stood out to you or them or their story [noise]\nI mean and they can use ... bad luck for feminism ... young children and that's not much I Can't find ... song\nAnd a peep from that dream and when they decided to leave that country because they don't have anything now a guinea pig France fight between negative for high that they they profess to live and I think we had an artist to survive\nMaria Rubio is communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us from ...\nWell President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neil is a senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and she knew you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nThis is actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods [noise]\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground in many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want\nThings to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states is a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would\nYou tell them you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\nNow here's the thing with the introduction of character and the swagger you have a lot of massage and eat right and you have a lot of lyrics that for women hip hop fans we listen to\nBut we weren't loving so how do the women and Caesar apply like what is going on in Nineteen eighty one is the music that we're hearing\nYeah you know it's funny and eighty eight when they'll be way came out one of the things that was so shocking about them was there sort of very free use of of curse words however us up to say that massaging the and kind of awful ideas and stories weren't conveyed without using curse words because there were\nDefinitely a woman countered that and by eighty eight we see a sophistication and relevance of women and hip hop that I don't think we saw prior on the level that it was right there is a release of queen ... song wrap my madness oh we loved\nIt [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nShe arrived on the scene it felt like fully formed like I think people forget just how young she was especially now that she's just like cover girl in of award winning yeah I mean ... I mean yeah she's at a talk show but back then she was a kid and she was striking\nBecause she is a phenomenal singer and she was a phenomenal lyricist and see\nYou know despite the massaging the and hip hop when some of my ... came out with a song like she was immediately accepted whenever I came out you hurt it everywhere every mix show every club but it was a that record was running\nThe other person I Want to bring up is mc light because I think well I think a queen my teeth and someone who does the kind of like singing Iran thing and feels very mainstream I feel like in the light went really hard [laughter] uh and we have ... here ten percent\nGet stuck on the news jam up nearly damp down\n[laughter]\nSo it's both of these artists you have people who I think Larry ... are very good but also those lyrics are not just about\nBeing attractive [laughter] being about attractive to men um and it feels like that's something I've been to remember from eighty eight\nWhy I think overall in eighty eight the premium was to be original unique really attempt to push the platform forward so what we see what ... what was the ... who was around that time as well uh let's see for what we see all the men who we well we've already mentioned as well\nIs that it was super competitive and it was just like the the doors wide open and and the possibilities which is endless\nYou also see artists having an eye on expanding that that success Lucy artist that had\nReal street credibility start to make records that perhaps compromised the style that endeared them to to fans or did you look at salt and pepper excuse me salt and pepper also better crossover hit and I to me to southern Cal pusher which will still hearing clubs today MC light on the other hand had\nNo interest in crossing over she was in the street\nWith just kept ... well I'm just glad that we get to ... because my my little gym very inappropriate but there was this amazing\nStretch Armstrong and buzz veto Garcia check out their pod cast what's good with stretch and veto thanks so much you guys I felt it was [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "25"}
