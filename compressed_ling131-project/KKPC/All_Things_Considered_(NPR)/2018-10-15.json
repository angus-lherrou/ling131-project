G\nI Trump suggested that it could have been the work of what he called rogue killers and this and make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin ... to stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nAnd if you say the president of a dispatch secretary ... talked with Saudi leaders and the search of a conflict today and it may be too soon to conclude this but these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\nI Want to ask you about swimming CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing to report the show was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S from Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened a door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight you're right they um they had this very strong relationship between the two countries they cooperate on things like counter terrorism and there was a U.S political element to this as well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America so they may look at things like whatever happened was not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain and interrogate ...\nThat went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis claims that the journalists had left the consulate safely\nYou mentioned President Trump today said maybe this was the work of rogue killers um I mean so many people are saying ... all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia having had a chance here where is that coming from what kind of reaction is getting\nUm well you know it's you know one of the two leaders are talking the Saudis and the U.S you know there's been growing outrage in the U.S and elsewhere about this and is still Mary Louise has touched a raw nerve\nAnd it's likely there would be a revulsion if the truth seems to be obscured somehow I spoke with a ... of the committee to protect journalists and he said it could stifle any criticism of Saudi leaders in the future\nBut surely love to cook or\nA ...\nA similarly people would worry about a chilling effect on free speech around the world after this incident if no one has held accountable [noise]\nNPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much Jackie thank you okay when talking about his reaction to the missing Saudi journalist ... G President Trump has emphasized weapons deals between the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nI don't like the concept of stopping an investment of a hundred million dollars into the United states\nA hundred and ten billion dollars and if you're a national security correspondent Greg Myre is here to take a closer look at that number I Greg hey Mary Louise hundred and ten billion is that the state of the current arms deals between the U.S in Saudi Arabia or no it is not\nThe president seems to be mixing some old contract some current contracts and some hope for a contract we spoke to some people who study this including Bruce ride dealt with the Brookings Institution\nHe noted that during the Obama administration to Saudis bought about a hundred and twelve billion dollars worth of us weapons so they that was in that ballpark\nBut those contracts are mostly come completed by now and here's what right Elle said when I asked him about the state of sales with the current administration\nFrom Donald Trump has been president United States and Saudi Arabia have concluded less than four billion dollars worth of arms dream of\nLess than four billion dollars so that is a big gap do we know how much the Saudis actually do spend are currently spending on weapons from the U.S well\nThey do spend a lot and they really ramped up their defense spending in recent years particularly because of this a protracted war they're fighting in Yemen in fact their defense budget is now considered to be the third largest in the world trailing only the United states and China\nAnd last year we've seen reports they bought three point four billion dollars of weapons from the U.S far more than any other country so as a general principle the Saudis are the biggest weapons fire from the United states not on the scale that the president has suggested\nOkay so that hundred and ten billion maybe aspiration or kind of wish list but ... what kind of weapons have they bought [noise]\nSo the fighter planes in the F. Fifteen or really the most significant single purchase right now because they're using that daily in Yemen and the bombing campaign has now been going on for more than three years\nBut the Saudis don't have a lot of big contracts at the moment as as we just heard and it's really the United states that that has the leverage because the in this relationship right now because of the way it supports in supplies the Saudi air force here's ... again\nTonight President Trump told the king he was cutting off spare parts to Saudi air force Saudi air force would be grounded tomorrow morning\nAnd the president has said that if the U.S doesn't sell weapons to the Saudis in Russia or China would step in and do it but it's it's really not that simple of raw deal noted that\nYou can't simply strap a Chinese bomb on an American F. fifteens all of the systems have to talk to one another so the Saudis really would be in a tough spot if the United states were to use that leverage and cut them off and look ahead with me\nGr I have the Saudis made any kind of commitments in terms of what arms deals they're looking for in the future the big\nOne that sort of been under some sort of discussion is a missile defense system but again they've spent an awful lot of money on the war in Yemen and they're not necessarily seen as being in the market for a big new contract right now\nSecond point the U.S Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has to approve these contracts and the Democrats in some Republicans are quite upset with the way the Saudis are prosecuting the war in Yemen and for the past year so they've really been reluctant and it doesn't look like it would be an easy go for the Saudis to get a new contract\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you Greg thank you\nLook like guys are supposed to stay Sammy and mostly clear today around Denver and Boulder hides in the mid forties\nThis is Colorado Public radio news things for listening and supporting us during our fall membership drive it might have felt a lot more like winter then fall this past weekend though with this now but so far there's no snow in the forecast for this week for the front range\nClear skies from Fort Collins to Pueblo today hides in the forties\nAnd thirties today in the mountains around veil\nSupport for Colorado Public radio comes from choose fitness offering workout space in the movie theater along with classes hydro massage could care and more information about shoes at C.

people have a sense that Denver is over building especially when it comes to downtown apartments but economists say actually Denver hasn't built and nuts apartments CPR business reporter Ben Marcus has more\nThe uptown neighborhood near downtown as the epicenter of apartment construction or just a couple of blocks more than Fifteen hundred units are under construction or just completed one is a hulking tower called radius uptown I took a tour of one of the units\nMarried everyone [noise]\nDid you use just moved in herself she's a new leasing agent for the complex two bedrooms\nAnd it's nice high end finishes and it's got a few close to restaurants still I was shocked to hear that such a new building is already more than Ninety percent full to be fair concessions have helped\nSo right now we're offering one month a free if you sign your least like within the month of October and then we'll throw in six months for parking is well that's a pretty good deal actually at odds with especially down here it's hard to find parking though making sure everyone has somewhere to park is is they\nConcessions for apartments are up sharply jumping forty one percent over last year it's an indication of just how intense the competition is for renters to fill all the new units and there is a ton of new supply builders finished more than ten thousand apartment unit from the Denver area last year [noise]\nAnother thirty thousand are under construction is was on seventeenth street across from the popular restaurants two bedrooms two enormous cranes are busy moving supplies into a city block sized pet this'll be another three hundred apartment homes when it's done\nHere in Denver we seem to hear at least a lot that there is a shocking amount under under construction that the number of cranes in the in the in the sky but the ... the numbers don't necessarily agree\nThat's not bad for the communist for CB Ari he says downtown Denver as probably under belt for apartments especially compared to similar cities like Seattle bad says Denver's creating lots of jobs and people are moving into the state to fill them and they tend to be young apartment dwellers\nYou know companies are continuing to to find themselves attracted to Denver and bring jobs here um we should see a healthy enough demand side to keep everything in check into into remain you know overall pretty healthy there's no forecast for a dramatic reduction\nA recent survey of national economists indicated that a recession could hit and twenty twenty but recessions are hard to protect\nCarry British I get an apartment appraiser has been in the industry since the eighties so there is an unprecedented level of apartment construction right now far beyond the previous peak of the late nineties but the units are filling some of the highest rates you've ever received\nMore than double our long term average and this is a rent levels that are at record highs for Denver\nAverage rents in the Denver area have grown to Fifteen hundred dollars a month downtown average is two thousand a month or one of the people moving to Denver they don't have huge salaries and so actually half of Denver renters are now rent burden meaning regardless of income they spend more than thirty percent of their paycheck on housing\nStill ... thinks the apartment construction in Denver makes sense to a point\nI think that there is room to grow my concern is that we're adding so much products so quickly downtown it's been a very fast paced\nAnd history suggests the recession hit apartments hard people stopped filling units immediately vacancies spice ramps fall this could be a disaster scenario especially now because Denver developers are building tens of thousands of units [noise]\nFor now that's not a problem
