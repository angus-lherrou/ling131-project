to the to the more normal turbulence of democracy set of instead of its current extreme version I invested or what should we do about this then\nWell I think on the on the uh just take the example of the\nThe Kavanaugh nomination um uh but there's so much more and the Trump Administration they the same could be set up we need you acknowledge what the baseline it this was not a normal process\nI

interests has done everything in town or to try to increase the degree of polarization\nBut in a certain sense that means that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is the result of\nThis kind of what I Would regard is really bad leadership it means that somebody with a different agenda you know could actually begin to emphasize you know common national identity things that Americans actually hold in common and walk us back a little bit from the precipice of ...\nFor ... we only have a minute left So Professor ... if that leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and I think that if you're you know if I really do think the upcoming election in November is one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have of holding their leaders accountable\nAnd there's going to be big

NPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing and he joins us now Hampton any pay their bills um so what exactly was sat in front of reporters what were these remarks that were so critical to us from China\nWill whiny really started out on a pretty harsh note saying to us it constantly escalated trade and tensions with China it harm China's interest in regards to Taiwan and it it made a lot of baseless accusations against Chinas foreign and domestic policies\nWanting noted that Pompeo would come to brief him about his trip to North Korea and to seek that China's cooperation and he said this is exactly why we should be cooperating and not confronting each other\nDid pay a respond to any of these criticisms in front of reporters\nWell he said to us and China where in fundamental disagreement on ... points and I think what came out through this was that China feels that the U.S is just launching an all out sort of Cold War on every front\nAnd I think this has something to do with the speech that vice president Mike Pence gave last week\nWhere he accused China of malign effort to undermine President Trump in the upcoming elections\nYeah that was just one of the things I mean really it was across the board from stealing American intellectual property to human rights as\nA treatment of the week or a minority in she's young it was really confrontational and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy with Chinese officials take such a fence at Mike Pence's speech if the vast majority of what he was saying substantively is that the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations still with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an inconvenience speech to be giving welcome hails making this trip\n[noise] you know this has been building up earlier this year we had a national security strategy an official document which basically means China as one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude you know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this\nThis depiction of China is really a rogue regime in one of the top threats to us security that that has to be dealt with harshly I really think that's the tone that China is reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials have been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China\nOr because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's top stance with China hurt the U.S his ability to reach a deal with North Korea\nAre well certainly that's the implication of what happened today of course we're seeing a confluence of factors is not just the north Korea issue\nThat the U.S needs China's help on it's it's so many issues of global importance but to us seems to want to put a competition with China in front of cooperation on these global issues\nAll right That's NPR's Anthony

you're going to ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it\nThey want to German America in June Venezuela\n[noise] why\nThey really do even for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president last midterm election knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing the house is is a problem losing the son it's a catastrophe\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nViews suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved within the house the big the big problem will be the judge is endless investigations of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had done high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the Benghazi investigation on steroids\nThis has been ... in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means that Trump's are is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to tell\nVoters former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are re elected to the majority of the nation\nOf the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get his America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIt is possible to triangulate which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues\nBut we're talking about a climate today that as much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago and so you know if the Democrats were to take control it would be you know an ugly was not fun our\nSome supporters of the president's paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did the Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever says that should be should not only fired because clearly they had no understanding of how politics works I think the president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do real fifty six\nHe's going to bomb a people were so like when there were sixty three is er got porch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\n... rules his party like you're going to see them a lot less if they get their books he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's gonna happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily yard of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the dealers will make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last few years there has kind of been\nThat steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted there really linked the almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world\nShe didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now or as long as they're being played on pop radio and she'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nNow this is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day and I always said I said I had her mind for me it lead Beckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concerts she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when it kind of music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in a meet and greet line when she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark\nIn ten minutes it was like going into an entirely different world so I over compensated by doing what's called ... um I Would make myself more presentable I thought I'm I was careful of ally spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed\n'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was silent about him I never called up the race doesn't like what well one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas\nAnd he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath\nAnd we could all pick a gift and it was like gag gift like we'll be cushions and all of this other stuff is just trying to get rid of\nAnd when it was my turn I pick the gift and there was a prescription drug look inside and a toy water gun and one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and\nBecause some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to\nUm and that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up and honestly that was a defining moment for me because I had to realize that hour's worth speaking up for if nothing else and\nThat they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinating was this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tells star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes through a ... are they hiding something costs though\nBut you still don't know if they did anything wrong\nRoswell research but if they open the door or reached through an open window they're probably going for with so far I think I see a guy I don't have to say ...\nIt was so interesting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just white against black racism it's much more complicated right you're you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we see policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know choose to idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught in some term that system can be taught African Americans as well so you have that version and then also you have another layer on top of it is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys on their side ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of a sixteen year old ... do you think audiences are more capable of empathy when they're watching a kid rather than an adult\nFor Apple with this kind of trauma receiving is kind of trauma unfortunately yeah yeah\nYeah when I first decided to write it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction saying anyway and all these new I wanted to write a young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because so often victims in these cases are teenagers they're young people\nOn Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve\nAnd I think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that one adult picked this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl them a thirty year old woman\nUm for some audiences there's something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence\nWho has so little experience you literally witness this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma and I think there's something about that at least for adults there's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually feed them as children and not as adults\nRider Angie Thomas and

Chang we're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food in the U.S meant taking a calculated risk\nThe country with growing people were moving into cities and industrialization gay food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products they were very inventive\nWhat's fake re back then because there were no rules against it right it's completely legal to do whatever\nThat's author Deborah Blum her new book explores that era before the U.S enacted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro talked with her about it\nThe book is called the poisons squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking ... someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons one dairy men seeking to sort of stretch their profits would Senate with water and it wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which was pond water pond water\nOn water and and and it was a notice when the family found worms wiggling in the bombs\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you would then the ... you had to reconstituted in all kinds of weird way what shocked us than a ...\nThey look we're a coal tar dies and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab did kind of make it more gold and again instead of kind of grayish are bluish and then because it was prone to rocks this is before ... and before refrigeration\nThey would dump preservatives in it and the most popular one was formaldehyde which is an embalming compound\nWhich is not good for humans to ingest\nNo and so you actually go out and can see in newspaper headlines around the country during this period was embalmed milk scandals\nSo along comes the protagonist of your story Dr Harvey Washington widely and his title is chief chemistry of the U.S department of agriculture why did he care so much about this issue [noise]\nAlways thought of them is kind of all how holy roller cameras right you of Harvey watching him while he was the son of itinerant preacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real mid nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher calling and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry and the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture I mean this\nThat a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of chemists that he commanded at the department of agriculture was it an food safety he took up that cause\nAnd your book titled the poison squad comes from project which he undertook it really just shows his commitment to this ah describe it the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals they're cooked by professional show of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that content stuff back food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you were testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nKnow one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poisoned people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were from page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments once that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when outsell a silk acid went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compound\nIs the spoke just one big argument in favor of government regulation in\nPart because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused than even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book is called the poison squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety of turnover twentieth century thanks for talking with us\nThank you so much for having
