a year\nAgo November first twenty Seventeen I began a segment on this program with these words we are reporting on news from inside the NPR newsroom today the news that day was that our top editor NPR senior vice president of news Mike Oreskes has had been forced out following allegations of sexual harassment\nWell today the next chapter of this story NPR has hired a new head of news her name is Nancy barns she is currently executive editor of Hearst Texas newspapers and the Houston Chronicle NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik is back to tell us more hello again David here Mary Louise what else should we know about Nancy Barnes\nWell she's earned or a strong record of a claim leading the Houston Chronicle journalistically she also was a a well regarded as editor of the Minneapolis Star Tribune uh she's received recognition within the industry both newspapers won a Pulitzer for their coverage under her leadership\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh he is meeting with Saudi Arabia's leaders about the disappearance and likely death of journalist Jamal ...\nShowed you talk to NPR earlier this year he told my colleague Jackie Northam that he was no fan of the direction crown prince Mohammed bin ... mine was taking Saudi Arabia\nHas no interest in particular the full he thinks he can do it alone and do you do this will really counted opinion or do you want to share those changes soldiers have you with him\nChilling words to hear now from that interview with our international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam and Jackie is with me now to talk more about the crown prince and whether he's a reformer or not he Jackie Hi Mary [laughter]\nSo early on a lot of people thought that he was headed down the path toward reform and the and one of the big things that was cited was his decision to allow finally Saudi women to drive people thought about what the promising and there were other motion of similar vein right\nYeah that's right it was just over a year ago in Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive again that ban was seen as a clear sign of repression and the king them [noise] um he also allowed women to go to work again any open movie theaters after about a thirty year ban on that too and all of this happened very quickly at the same time it faces they were all\nTV and magazines and that so we see is very dynamic compared to the rest of the older Saturday leaders who are known for making the decisions very slowly he\nAlso turned to open up the economy making Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil\nYes that's right yeah and and that's not going very well at all and here's where we really start to see the ... side of the crown prince he\nWanted to make fundamental changes to the economy and quickly and it's part of that he wanted to fight corruption is a way to bring in foreign investment\nBut it was a way that he did it that's become emblematic of how he operates instead of using laws in court he rounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and princes and government ministers and he held them at the Ritz Carlton hotel for more than three months\nUntil they paid hundreds of millions of dollars to get out\nNow most people would say that's probably not a good way to attract foreign investment in fact I Would probably do just the opposite which it appears to have done I'm thinking\nAlso some of his recent moves on the international stage of the war in Yemen where Saudi Arabia has carried out a sink ships it largely indiscriminate bombing campaign and then there was the situation with the prime minister of Lebanon remind\nUs what the minister Saad Hariri ah he was visiting and Saudi Arabia and he was detained by the crown prince of think about it detaining a sitting prime minister or well he's visiting your country and that's how I built him a reputation for being reckless in a bully and many of the analysts that I've talked to over the past few months\nThinks this is because he just doesn't sinks through or recognize the repercussions of what he's doing 'em and perhaps he doesn't have a great world view and you know he ... he didn't travel abroad very much unlike most other Saturday elites and so perhaps he doesn't have a keen sense of geopolitics\nCircle back to that tape of your interview with ... where he said he doesn't think the crown prince ... we want to encounter opinion\nIt was a consensus that recent events might be proving that remark prophetic\nWhen in fact actually over the many months now I he's rounded up for religious figures economists activists including\nThose who uh work to get the female driving ban overturned\nAnd he doesn't tolerate criticism as you say um and that included from ... you know he saw the handwriting on the wall he had to leave the country because of that and how what are they ready to come here had to you know he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened his suspected murder\nWill have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing\nThank you Jacki thanks very NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor I'm son in law during ... time at the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nAnd pure White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe cheer to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including toward Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office\nTheir first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nUh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east\nAnd coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... rolling working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... that is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump\nOr but there had been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ground for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to a Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... showed gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance oh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security shame\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear\nAnd some of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars in apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from logged me

he does too to prove his manhood and\nI'm sure you read that part of the ... then that your interpretation of the character was based on knowing that that happened and I was wondering if you were ever in a position where you have to prove your manhood in a way that felt wrong or uncomfortable but like you had to do it\n... [noise]\n[noise] wow um\nYeah I mean they're they're definitely been times in my life where I felt that um the first thing that comes to mind was\nUm wow we're going in huh\n[laughter] base as you or something else mysterious [laughter]\nUm well let's see the first thing that comes to\nMind was ah in school I remember a little early high school I went to a number of different schools growing up in\nUh the second one that I went to a during the first week of school I remember the we were in in the class and and you know I sort of done our activities are waiting for the bell during and I was a new kid at school and so I sent by myself with my glasses on a you know the oversized cope that my mom bought and made me aware\nThat I didn't like but I Would anyway and I'm and I'm sitting on that I remember this kid who was one of those sort of cool kids saying looking over at me and say who him\nAnd uh it got really silent in the kick outta walked over\nAnd stared down at me as I sit down and they reach back and punish me for no reason and instantly dislike circle formed around us and um and it became this moment you know non like guys I'm thinking about it not unlike the moment in a in a moment where like this group of kids are around us around the\nYou know it goes on and\nI remember like it was yesterday this dislike feeling like well this is the moment where either I have to like defend myself and like hit him back even though that doesn't feel entirely right or\nThe rest of my high school life will probably I Will be probably considered a coward and probably have to deal with this you know for the next four years um and\nYeah from somewhere I guess the within me or something the courage and and took a swing that connected in\nAny way we want to have in this fight and NFL horribly about it of course it's not really my nature to be like that but um it did feel like that moment of one of many moments along the way of of sort of you know proven you're proven my manhood even though it didn't feel entirely right who won the fight I\nWould say that I wanted to Harry [laughter]\nYeah he ... he was older than I was so you know after we exchange a couple of swing a people sort of part of this and uh I I think I came up to the next day of school I came in and I remember walking into into the gym and all they all were there and the kid John ... was there\nGives so when

Nuggets have not made the playoffs since the twenty twelve season but they've come very close the last two years\nThey're a young team that's looking to break their playoff drought in the new season that begins tonight CPR is the villa recently sat down with Nick ... who covers the nuggets for the sports website the athletic\nNick the nuggets were good team last year what did they do to get even better this off season well\nVic I think that the nuggets are going to count largely on the continued internal growth of the players that they already had the the big word around nuggets training camp last week and into this weekend and really just up until the season opener\nI'm against the clippers is continuity um ... this is I think the first year that they feel like they they know exactly who they are um they know who their best players they know that cynical yolk itch they know they're going to operate everything around him\nNicole yolk which are the big man from Serbia who is really become the nuggets big star and Nick yo yo catch just signed a big new contract in the off season right\nYeah he he did he actually signed the largest contract ever\nFor European player or four years over a hundred and fifty million dollars so that shows the the investment that the nuggets having this guy he's the face of their franchise now he is the guy that you know he's going to be on the marketing billboards he's going to be the guy that\nYou know they they put out in the community as the face of this team so expectations for him not only on the court but kind of as a part of this organization will really grow\nA Nick ten of the nuggets first Fifteen games are at the Pepsi Center how important is it for this team to start well given how strong the western conferences\nYeah the western conference you mentioned it Vicki ... is\nUm brutal brutal and that's that's a really good way to put his perhaps as strong\nAs it's ever been and so when you're exactly right when you're talking about any point within the season where there is an opportunity for you to pile up wins and tried to start taking advantage of what your schedule gives you that's paramount for Denver Michael Malone\nAnswers his fourth season is now gets coach ... are a better team since he got here but fans I talked to say there's no more excuses it's time this team make the playoffs again how much pressure does Malone face to win this year\nWell there's a lot of expectations I think you mentioned the fan base and also I think from the front office this team needs to be a playoff team this year they this is I think the first year within the regime of\nOf Tim Conway the president or basketball operations and Mike Malone head coach where they've come out and said we like there is no more steps to take you know you you finish one game out of the postseason two years and the road there's nowhere else to go into the playoffs\nA Nick the the the nuggets are exciting to watch there is no doubt about it but one area that's left a lot to be desired is defense um will they be better at stopping the other team from scoring this year\nThat's that's the million dollar question because the nuggets aren't going to probably be a top ten defensive team they don't need to be the top to\nTeam what they need to be as average on that side of ... yeah I'm ... and it and it sounds kind of weird to say let's be average [laughter] but when you can improve it it is and when you are as good as they are on a fence\nJust to balance that out um they need to be better on defense and here's a couple of quick things that they need to be able to do they need to be able to play transition defense better and and that starts with not turning the ball over so much that that's been a huge problem for this team it's it's weird it's had again in the pre season they have to take better care of the basketball to prevent easy baskets the other way\nAnd the other thing is continuing to guard the three point line they they were the they were the worst in the NBA last year in opponents three point field goal percentage\nSo when when they're when teams are shooting at a high volume against you and they're shooting them with the fish and sea you're going to give up a lot of points shoot out\nYour phone for fans but also hard on\nThe uh digested they would leave Michael Mullen pulling out what little hair he has left that continue to go that\nWay the northwest division is arguably the toughest in the NBA will the nuggets finely emerge from this stiff competition to make a playoff run\nI think they will I I think this is the year that they're going to take that leap a the nuggets are going to get a lot better I think this year I think they can win my my guest has been for them to win fifty games\nAnd just to put it in perspective for folks who may not follow the NBA everyday fifty games is a lot of ...\nYeah yeah yes I'm the question is whether that will be enough given how good the western conferences I think ultimately they will do just enough to get into the play offs um but it's going to be a um kind of a bloody brutal ride to get their throughout this entire season because the western conference\nIs as good as it's ever been and and it's for fans it's going to be a ... a lot of fun because there's going to be incredible games every night\nNick ... covers the nuggets for the athletic Nick thanks for talking today thank Slavic ...\nThat sort of stuff you hear from ... fellow that talks about sports is not something that was around just a short time ago here in Colorado Public radio who's gone from being a ledger reporter meaning he covers the state capital of somebody\nWho's going and all kinds of direction coverings for its covering human interest\nAnd the reason

Ninety million dollars to individual campaigns was about three weeks to go before election day\nCPR is Ben Marcus told MORNING EDITION host Mike lamp why so much money has been spent on this election really\nComes down to two groups the oil and gas industry and Jared polar and both of those groups are breaking records just by themselves\nOkay the oil and gas industry they are fighting a battle on like\nTwo different fronts right [noise] yes it was interesting because they're supporting one measure this would basically if it passes would force governments to compensate them for new regulations or any business really for new regulations and they're also fighting about\nThat would effectively bad and most new drilling at least according to the industry and so they've raised the staggering thirty eight million dollars in their campaign group that's almost double the next closest I could find in state history going back to two thousand fourteen there was a measure\nTo expand casino games that Aurora horse tracks that raise twenty million that was the previous record or it should be noted too that the group that is supporting the setbacks are against the industry they've raise less than a million dollars so you've got thirty eight million to less than one million\nNow the Colorado governor's races also breaking spending records with Jared polish the Democratic candidates are spending a good portion of his own fortune on his campaign\nTwenty two million dollars so far I'm nobody's ever spend money like that on their own campaign in Colorado history you've spent eleven million dollars of his own money just since the primary um he's a tax millionaire he's never been afraid of spending money on politics\nAnd his Republican opponent Walker Stapleton uh he's cobbled together about Thirteen million dollars both in his own campaign and superPACs would support him\nPull it also has a constellation of packs superPACs with support him as well who are contributing almost eight million dollars so huge money advantage to Jared polish but Walker Stapleton also has a significant amount of cash to get his message out\nIt's also going to be a crowded ballot with a lot of ballot measures and a lot of spending on those campaigns to\nWrites everybody's ballot will be a little bit different depending on where you live Denver voters will see twenty some odd questions on their ballot but quickly the transportation sales tax will be on there that's around about ten million dollars in campaign spending\nA increased income taxes for schools are a couple of million bucks on both sides of out issue restrictions on payday lenders there's millions of dollars flowing into ... issue as well\nAnd there's also money than flowing into especially state Senate races where Republicans have a narrow majority and they want to keep it\nFor the state senators very much in play at one seat majority for Republicans are and so we're seeing money poured into these racism amounts of never seen before a Democrats have a huge advantage and direct contributions to candidates\nThree to one two to one advantage and they also have an advantage and superPACs I'm so there's millions of dollars flowing into super PACs that will\nDecide the fate of this election but Democrats definitely have the advantage in both superPAC indirect a fundraising and they say that that show there's momentum behind the Democrats whereas Republicans are saying\nIt doesn't really matter like you can there's diminishing returns after so many millions of dollars you can't buy anymore TV space it's all take it up\nA ... Republicans also feel like some of the ballot measures will get conservative voters out to vote because their tax increase of 'em so Republicans feel pretty good about their chances of it but I Will to get their message out even though they have a big money disadvantage\nThat CPS Ben Markus in for more of binge breakdown on state election spending go to our website and the address there is CPR dot org this is CPR news\nCPR dot org is also where you can get entered to win a trip for two to London right now only until six PM so now's the time CPR dot org one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty I'm Rachael ... finished director here with Sam brash and we're giving away the trip\nTo London to incentivize you can become a member of Colorado Public radio to support the kind of reporting that you heard there from Denmark ass\nOr it's that simple we can't do the reporting without you and we're going to as a bonus send somebody in London sure why not\nYeah why not and I do want to thank our sponsors for this trip a British Airways visit Britain in Denver international airport\nThey gave this London prize trip package to encourage all of you to support Colorado Public radio and everything it brings to the community like that election coverage you just heard from Ben Marcus I mean originally you and I both know Ben really well we know how much he loves\nBetter work well up here and an hour long CNN town hall of Arabs are Maro evening and ... on the Texas border Ted Cruz declined to participate so work will after the voters questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News [noise]\nJust about an hour left to give to Colorado Public radio and also be automatically entered into a chance to win a trip for two to London this is it we are up against the deadline\nOf our London sweepstakes and if you were considering giving the Colorado Public radio now is the time to do it I'm San brash I'm a reporter here at Colorado Public radio here with Rachel as to broker a news director\nAnd we're here to ask you for your support I mean the London sweepstakes it's something that is meant to incentivize you to give but we need your help we are trying to be you know a state wide news service like it's every single corner of Colorado\nAnd we can't do that without you so if you want to join in CPR dot org or call us one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen\nThirty I guess that was like some British pop music go go yeah yeah yeah and I didn't yourself in London this trip is totally a choose your own adventure you can do anything you want when you're there in London so uh you know you can only when if you get entered go to CPR dot org or call one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nEvery gift is an automatic injury but for just over a little over an hour now so\nGet in on that right now CPR dot org one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty you\nMight not be listening later and if you aren't then you could miss their shot I mean our five minutes left to go six PM easier deadline if you want to give and also have a chance to be headed to London do not wait I Want to thank our British Airways visit Britain in the Denver international airport for giving us this London trip package\nThey did it to encourage you to give they did it because they recognize that Colorado Public radio\nCreates value in this community by keeping people informed it is a free service it's accessible to everybody that is what Public Radio's about and you make sure that happens when you give we've heard from people like Roy in Boulder barb in Denver although in Denver Vicky in Denver\nEven evergreen they're all now entered into a into the sweepstakes when a trip to London so don't miss your chance CPR that or or call us one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nCPR is part of your life as part of your community you know we get people\nPledging that they're giving because their son graduated from college or they're donating and their spouses memory it's amazing to see how how personal Colorado Public radio is just so many people\nAnd want to continue in it is to them throughout their daily life throughout their commute there and back from work I mean that is true for me\nWhat is that worth teams go to C.

U.S officials said they want a thorough investigation into what happened something us secretary of state Mike Pompeo made clear to reporters drum refueling stop in Brussels today\nI'm going with the Saudis understand that America is taking this seriously\nAnd I\nAm hopeful that the Saudis say 'cause there's they indicated to me yesterday that they would [noise]\nTime time will certainly tell we'll get to see the investigation and we'll see the results of\nPresident Donald Trump meanwhile says he's asking turkey to provide audio or video to the U.S a bit exists\nTrump says he's not sent the FBI since the journalist while contributing comes to the Washington Post is not a U.S citizen president getting called for Saudi Arabia and important ally to or cause important now I don't even countries a customer for US military exports\nDropped administration is threatening wouldn't draw from another international treaty as NPR's Yuki Noguchi explains the latest involves a postal agreements Trump asserts gives Chinese companies an unfair advantage when they ship goods to the U.S\nFor forty four years the U.S has been part of the universal postal union which sets shipping rates for international deliveries\nPoor developing countries including China I pay lower rates while rates in the U.S and Europe are higher nowadays because so many products are shipped into the U.S from China\nThe Trump Administration argues this amounts to a subsidy this new escalation of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing could mean higher prices for American consumers\nRight well this was billed as a fact finding mission and the Turks seemed pleased that Washington is showing not just in involved in here but support for Turkey's investigation\nOr there was a delay in searching the consul general's residence the Saudi consul general's residence er and that's what caused the foreign minister to say we need some more cooperation here but that surge then did begin today\nA Pompeo told reporters that the administration is not going to get ahead of the investigations and draw conclusions but he denied the U.S would downplay or gloss over the killing of a journalist if that's what happened here's what he said\nI'm not I'm not going to speculate obviously someone country gauges activity with is a lawful unacceptable nope no one is going to defend\nActivity of that big but\nPalmdale at the same time make clear that the church should be mindful of the many important partnerships that bind to us in Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump is said much the same thing\nNow there have been some new details coming out today about what happened in that conflict and we should warn listeners that some of these details are graphic tell us what this investigation has revealed\nTurkish and Saudi investigators did enter the consul general's residence today with Saudi permission continuing their search of Saudi diplomatic buildings in property or the constantly building was searched Monday and apparently evidence was found pointing to a killing their at least according to the Associated Press\nTurkish authorities have also said they intend to search Saturday diplomatic vehicles but to get your point a pro government newspaper has published a very graphic details of the torture and killing allegedly of Mr ... including him having his fingers cut off before he was killed\nAnd forensics expert putting on music to drown out the sound of the dismembered rented the body\nOr no it's not clear how long are the Turkish investigation or the Saudi internal investigation into that matter will go on a secretary of state Pompeo today said we should give them a handful of days to get this over with sooner is better than later he said\nIt's all on the one hand the Turks say they have audio recordings of what happened in the conflict on the other hand the Saudis are claiming to have had nothing to do with it kept those two narratives really get resolved in these investigations wrapped up in just a few days\nThat is not at all clear I mean there are some suggestions that this would have to be a quite a long investigation to resolve the dispute like that and there's been no timetable given on this and a President Trump today did say a ... we should know what happened to ... by the end of the week uh whether that will actually happen we just have to wait and see\nAnd what about the international response is there any kind of an organized punishment or condemnation of Saudi Arabia for the growing evidence that it was involved in this killing of a U.S resident journalist\nOr internationally that's not at all clear relations between ... and ... good and the Turkish investigators have been robust but how other world powers will respond is still an open question\nPeter Kenyon in Istanbul thank you I think sorry\nThat sort of coverage is what you can come to expect from Colorado Public radio it's what we try and do and it's not easy that sort

has appointed two top jobs in the government lately he's going after someone who sets monetary policy\nAnd none of my biggest threat is the fed is because the fed is ranging rage too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing\nThat with Trump attacking Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the Fox Business Network last night there is a history of tension between the White House and the fed and NPR's Uri Berliner joins us to tell us more about this very hello or let's start with what's happening right now why is the president going after the chairman of the Federal Reserve\nBut back in July he said he wasn't happy with the fed rate hikes he suggested that they could interfere with the economic expansion and then more recently right after the stock market fell off\nYou complained again some a lot more strenuously you said the fed had gone crazy and was out of control then yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat\nNow the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independence but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend his policies if they could criticize\nYou ever heard of that tape Trump saying well the fed is independence I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the biggest threat he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nYeah that's true it's not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William Mick Chesney Martin this was in Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs and the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and in Nineteen sixty five LBJ some and Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talked\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election or the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who's known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks happening now\nHis rhetoric not surprisingly how blunt it is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any other president who said the fed is crazy\nOr what when presidents are unhappy with the fed is almost always for the same reason presidents want lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy\nThat can boost growth and not coincidentally make presidents more popular but I can also lead to inflation presidents don't often worry about inflation central banks do however that's part of their job so there can be this inherent tension between the fed and the White House that can really pick up during an election year\nRight it's independent but also served kind of at the pleasure of the president is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump\nThere is no indication of that the fed is supposed to be protected from politics and politicians Donald Trump has acknowledged that he's the one who appointed power and that the fed is independent but the fed is really seemed to have gotten\nThe fed is really seemed to have gotten under your skin is NPR's Uri Berliner thanks for joining us today You're welcome [noise]\nHi my name is mercury I'm from Boulder and I love contributing to Colorado Public
