see themselves on the front line of fixing the housing crisis because federal housing subsidies for the poor have steadily declined since the Nineteen eighties\nBlum says rent control is just a band aid and at the root of the problem is the fact that there's just not enough housing\nThe real solution to our affordable housing crisis is more construction of housing\nAcross the whole spectrum\nState estimates it needs to build well over a million new units right now\nLand is in short supply and a lot of what is being built is high end and that's fueling a lot of the anger and

in human history\nChina's government has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over near forty years\nThere's never been anything like it and China's new wealth and power are changing world this week we're starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dotson joins us now to give us a preview hey well I also\nSo I understand the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China from the outside [noise] right\nWell for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one atomic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and\nChina's not rising anymore it's risen right what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and if you want to see that engagement you have to be looking outside of China and how did\nYou decide where to go to assess China's math that influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe south east Asia\nAnd what we were looking to do is not just to sort of achieve a a geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies\nStruggling societies places that are very far afield generally far out of their orbits and places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd without telling us too much about the stories written here in the next coming days give it a fan of what you found well\nIt'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz out a he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China in Australia have a really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners\nBut the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing that's really remarkable here is that China's no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into the public sphere of other countries' interest I think censorship in foreign country exactly\nWhere else did you guys go well in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure project that links to of Kenya's largest cities\nNow this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed but it's now leading to greater local resentment added this Chinese operation using Chinese labor\nAnd there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating get traps that could cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they are making masses investments are in these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story that look some of the problems that can the devil even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China's stifling free speech\nFear over investment in certain high tech sectors\nAnd also there's growing concern about China is investing huge amounts and ports around the continent\nHere's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe they've invested all along the periphery of Europe it's like almost an anaconda strategy like he's surrounded and squeeze it and that way you have some control and lovers what an ominous analogy in anaconda you had exactly the anaconda strategy and how China chooses to use that leverage Howard

exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this as a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat said the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they said that uh they do want a full investigation they've made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive ... investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in the background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they want to the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct\nThat was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it's almost inevitable a on this question of senior U.S Senate GOP a pointed to comments at Seventy Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend a Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kevin us friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations said back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSort of have mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing about three days so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez\nAh she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much cricket side of the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point it also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat neck\nOr and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question one of course is Kevin us read mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI or his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell in the last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nOr but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match a those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin us truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony that it's a something that\nShould be looked into when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had to say NPR's Ryan Lucas thanks Ryan thank you [noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nThanks for joining us on

T Rowe price invest with confidence\nAnd NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro there'd been a lot of books written about chaos and dysfunction in the Trump White house\nThe latest book by Michael Lewis looks lowered down the food chain that parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created\nOn how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out when on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up\nWell the real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo there's jock there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people\nA prominent group of business economists are predicting the economy should continue to grow it a healthy pace this year or next though

July Nineteen eighty two\nAnd what else what else do you think is manageable to do within one week\nRoad to do quickly could do a polygraph of all three people involved in the alleged sexual assault judge Kavanaugh mark judge and a doctor for you good polygraph all three of them\n... high there are allegations that involve Kavanaugh's behavior well under the influence of alcohol um during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough pro ... of his drinking habits in high school and in college\n[noise] yes I was in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want that on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn up the information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have said a background investigation I cannot what tell me why\nDo I I Do because of the training the FBI yeah it's really a while the staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country\nAnd the agents who signed this case legends on backgrounds or will train who've done it many times\nIt turns out the FBI finds information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court does he have a responsibility to pursue those additional leads\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case so I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and are limited scope recording to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth was additional interviews\nDo you think the FBI has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't uh at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI good request additional time if they found no evidence information about why the background is being conducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the request\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nOr you will for most of it's like you\nEven as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices Republicans had hoped to seat judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he face Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president for sure the American people the cabinet would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices\nBack then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued\nA challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThe species' lives in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land his challenge the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a
