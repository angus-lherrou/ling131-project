S. spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remembered thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ministry she might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and proper like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to join the IMF if the U.S started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget that's it\nThe artist David Welna David thank you for your reporting you about commodity\nResidents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the destruction caused by hurricane Michael\nAs a snapshot of where they stand now twelve days after the storm about Seventy thousand customers remain without power some water and sewer systems are not working\nAnd cell phone service is spotty a complete breakdown of communications during and after the storm cripple the emergency response and now it hinders recovery NPR's Debbie Elliott reports Jim\nMelvin lives in all sorts Florida a small rural town about sixty miles inland has property looks as if a tornado came through trees are down everywhere including one that fell through the roof of his house he says he wasn't prepared for the strength of hurricane Michael\nWho's been there forty five years and now we've had hair a cage but we'll never had nothing as far inland like this\nAnd he says he's certainly never been cut off from the outside world like that says\nNo communication there and the cell phone might come on our and golf and be all for six hours or more you never knew when it was coming and going\nFamily could not get in touch after the storm to know that he survived that's been a major problem throughout the region where hundreds of people have been reported missing because the phones aren't working it's also hampered search and rescue operations because first responders couldn't talk to one another\nHurricane rescue specialist Adam she says it's an Achilles' heel\nReally thought about how to act but it wasn't a flood off and on a cell phone [noise] do you go to college out here for us the spotty so and it's a it's a hindrance\nIn Dade County where Michael made landfall a third of cell service remained out as of yesterday according to the Federal Communications commission the county's emergency services chief Mark Bowden says that's unacceptable\nOur community has been traumatized the inability to communicate because of arise and not for whatever reason not being able to implement their continuity of operations equipment effectively\n... says it's slowing all aspects of the recovery\nYou know the insurance adjuster that people need to treat persons that people need the contractor that people eat absolutely communications is the core\nBone says the county also had issues with what officials thought were redundant communication systems everything went down satellite fiber and cellular the wind blew outlines attached to utility poles and uprooted trees ripped apart underground fiber lines\nEven the public safety radio system is compromised for a time ... says they had no way to get word out about basic things like where to get food and water\nHere's all these resources flooding in but there's you can't even find out where to go get him you know it's it's word of mouth you know college for us\nThe Panama City public radio station W.

of artificial intelligence\nIs called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars\nComputer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auction by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you a pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art well\nI think every couple of generations you have something that happened that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hanging on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty\nFirst century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price that in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's\nFor helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and\nThis is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is a first it is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited and numbered edition after the sale I don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nSome of the special pot sales tax does fund one time grant schools can use for things like keeping kids off drugs preventing bullying promoting literacy\nAnd a separate tax on marijuana growers is contributing to a fund for repairing and renovating school buildings fixing roofs and occasionally building new schools Christian Hoffman from evergreen gets it but\nIt was supposed to go to buildings repair new schools was my understand\nBut she and her friends see that in Jefferson County there is a half a billion dollar bond measure on her local ballot to repair and renovate old school that's why she asked drew Colorado wonders\nWhere is the marijuana money from taxes that was supposed to help offset some of those costs yes\nIt's supposed to offset those tough but here's why it simply isn't making much of a dent for most schools the growers pot tax has contributed about forty million a year into a building fund that district can only access if they can match the funding that means going to voters\nCompare that to the amount Kristen Hoffman's district just one district needs for school repairs a half\nA billion dollars and the amount schools across the state estimate they need to fix their buildings that is fourteen billion dollars in case you missed that fourteen billion dollars a new school cost about\nTwenty five million dollars so maybe the marijuana tax would
