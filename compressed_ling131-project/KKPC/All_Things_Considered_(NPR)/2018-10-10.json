considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly ... Chang this morning began with a surprise resignation from the White House Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters that the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's got an incredible job she's a fantastic person very importantly but she also is somebody that get sick\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for trying twenty\nI can tell me she when are we doing his points so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nSaid All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of that same are at higher so why now why is he stepping down ... well\nThat is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote her resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally millionaire self she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure form\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe sometime in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as\nKind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right might have been held it\nYeah so that they have different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leading on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a in a cellar right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of many writers of his foreign policy team but she hasn't been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get confound today she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different what the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately now some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burn a Sharon brand as someone independent foreign policy hawk but not\nA total Trump dust she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician so as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but\nAre we to assume that this is really the end of her political career we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty\nUm she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina F. one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established and it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands [laughter] of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump family That's NPR's Mara Liasson thanks Martin thank you [noise]\nThe national Security Agency is the country's largest intelligence agency\nAnd among its most secretive

to talk about whistle blowers\nI felt very strongly that this was a key function for an inspector general's office to have a robust whistle blower program at\nHis office received five hundred and sixteenth calls on its hotline during a recent six month period they run the gamut from complaints about contractors who allegedly charge too much to whistle blowers who claim they suffered reprisals

are a lot out there that say they shouldn't do this shouldn't be that than in the past they have gotten around them and that's why we ended up with these are huge dropping scandals\nThere are hints of a new approach the NSA Director used to hire and fire the inspector general under new rules store is the first nominated by president and confirmed by the Senate in July ... released an unclassified version of a semi annual report something never done before\nAnd there's the office logo when store to arrive the office of the inspector general R. O. Y. G. had the same one as the you know say with an eagle at its center\nAnd I thought wait a minute we're independent or y G he put together a graphics teams are logo now has a big all which looks like it's doing oversight I said\nHis recent report does address weighty issues like the government's use of the foreign intelligence Surveillance Act or fight so\nWe found that there were several deficiencies that had the potential to impact protection of us person privacy\nHe also raised concerns about Internet searches that could jeopardize civil liberties however the details are only in the classified version of his report\nShortly after taking the job ... invited watchdog groups to the NSA one attendee niche Whelan box of the project on government oversight says this storage\nHe I think he's a breath of fresh air over there\nBut he predicts it will be hard to change the culture around whistle blowing\nThe fear of retaliation Israel I mean a lot of people don't want to even go to all that even if they could ultimately prevail you know many months or even in some cases years down the road it's just it's a it's a headache it's a nightmare\nThat's when I was able to get my ticket so I mean is that how old you have to be sixteen to fly blurb for for a private pilots Tiffany yes she can be a student pilot prior to that\nAnd actually my son Bobby was the youngest person in the world's a solo in a hot air balloon at age nine but he did it in an ultralight balloons so there's no pilots to ... or age requirements for an ultralight\nSo it's a family affair savannah what about you you always know he wanted to join in the family business\nUh no actually when I was little I had no desire to become a pilot\nAnd I was just happy being a proud member of the ground crew and just helping out wherever I could but something clicked when I was Thirteen and I just kind of decided you know what like I'm going to start my training and I so low down my fourteenth birthday and got my license on my sixteenth birthday\nWhile one of the things I Love about the Albuquerque fiesta is the pictures of all those balloons just hanging in the air there so colorful they're beautiful what's your balloon look like this year\n[noise] ah the one that I'm flying actually is a a beautiful blue in with the orange red and yellow colors and it has the as the assemble which is the state symbol for a for a New Mexico or on the equator on two sides so I'd definitely stands out it's pasteurized balloon so I'm Carrying twelve passengers every morning with me\nAnd this is my fortieth a fiesta that I've attended I've fallen thirty seven of them\nAnd I'm Still in all every single time it's a beautiful sight out\nThere it is ... what's your ...\nAh my balloon is black on the bottom with a rainbow the rainbow colors coming down from the top and it's I Believe in that holds or about a four people and it's amazing and this is my third year in fiesta but I've seen it every year in my life and I love it\nSavannah we heard how your dad as this experience sort of celebrated pilot what's it like to have him as your guy does he given you tips for flying over the years\nI'm definitely I actually funny enough I didn't want to learn how to fly from my dad 'cause as great as he is he's my dad\nDidn't want him telling you what to do their homework fire balloons\nSo I had a different instructor but now especially as I'm becoming a more experienced pilot he's been a very very great mentor and helped me to work towards the things I Want to accomplish\nRight I'm sure you're very comfortable up there in the sky but do you worry about your daughter up in a balloon\nOf course because it's so my daughter so as as accomplished as she is and I know how good our pilots she is um I still require after every landing to give me a call and let me know that she's down in safe so yeah I'm Still bad for sure what what are the risks up there so high in the sky\nThe risks are nominal um provided that you're a really uh you know paying attention is like any other form of aviation um the number of accidents that happen are very rare and then it's infrequent\nHowever when they do or they can have some dire consequences so um the the real risk that are out there and are mitigated by you know good calls on on the field before you ever take off so it's really a pilot judgment and making sure that the pilots picking a good day to fly well\nThere are some changes to the fiesta this year one drone will be allowed to fly with the balloons to take pictures and there have been some concerns or by local pilots maybe you're one of them about not having enough places to land because the area around Albuquerque is becoming more developed\nWhat about that if you notice any big changes to your sport\nOh the the Albuquerque areas definitely changed dramatically like um when I started flying the entire north part of Albuquerque was not built up into anything is still open fields\nAnd now we're really truly flying into congested area every single flight so um but the city of Albuquerque is very very balloon friendly so the city itself designates that basically any school park golf course anything this city owned is open and and welcoming to balloon is\n[noise] that's Troy Bradley and his daughter savannah who are hot air balloon pilots flying in the forty

the past six months and couldn't get worse the financial stability report was released at the IMF World Bank autumn meeting on the Indonesian island of Bali Michael Sullivan reports\nThe IMF says the risks are still moderate but could increase significantly in a hurry if global trade tensions increase a messy rex it could also upset the global economic apple cart as good rising debt in China the report says\nAnd it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working just think about other things that could possibly go wrong um and like a kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think uh we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was the sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of hit me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nAnd I think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nAnd also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal in conjunction with with Janet with Jan and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about disappeared in their life\nAnd just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to a family where you're trying to raise kids you know it it Neal's case to you know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York it asked her the in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash and clean the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that that this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um after his space craft\nStocks with the fuel spacecraft in space the first time one space craft has doctor with another\nThe whole thing gets out of control anything safety I like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with\nThat's causing everything to be out of control so he on docks and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control and he's just kind of spinning and tumbling and it's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes\nWhere you can just experience\nThe the and the extremes of being I'm\nIn space capsule and this case because it's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it's a ... right now so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\nWe wanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the Gemini mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this sort of you know everyone kind of feeling like ah like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick to face\nThis problem you you described began and it's not just that it was a this you know kind of immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of cutting out to big wide shots that would\nThat would sort of overly explain things trying to really be subjective and immersive to what Neal himself and he and his and his colleague Dave Scott would be experienced and I think that was really important to us\nAnd that was just one of many instances of you know I guess what I'd qualify as you're near failures or in certain cases failures that led the way to the success story of the moon landing um um so I think trying to remind audiences how fragile this all was how dangerous or the lives that almost cost in some cases the lives of it\nTo uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast year and I hate it when did we ain't getting jostled from we we\nHave to take a we had to take a moment\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second because rice the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\n... another thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is ... I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside\nThe space capsule at least in less than ... capital of the bat that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about [noise]\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know a soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through or at least the only way they felt they could get through was was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that is sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know ... is in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them uh uh you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear\nOr they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\nI'm suggesting her which did the score for the film and you also work with him on whiplash another land you met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um I Know music is very important to you during the the moon landing sequence\nUm there's music that sounds to me like part military part like western seeing music and\nYou Star Trek refer to space as the final frontier\nI don't know it was intentional to have a kind of western edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military impact kinda galloping like horses in a western\n[noise] uh well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping good sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflected Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kinda get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves it's is it an intercom when you are\nYeah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio\nOr between the capsule and kept calm or an ... control and whatnot um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you're listening to all of it on line and and ah\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going away and that thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh you know a everyone had come too far at that point to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music wise or we could get in to Neal's mine space that we can get into that sense of just relentless on stopping drive\nUm ah it would it would set the scene\nOkay let's hear some of that music and the moon landing music\nFrom the score for first man [noise]\nX. men landing music from just inherently to score\nFirst man and new movie that Neil Armstrong and his various space missions and then landing\nOn the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and whiplash\nThey're saying that your film as become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera from them or\nIs it an excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication the Daily Caller\nAnd this is from September fourth the interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... with not shown was asked do you think that's upsetting\nAnd Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of its almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he'd have to think that people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world a boycott and then he goes on to talk about ... and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that a carousel think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show at least show it several times so to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface\nIn terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know in showing\nThe the physical sticking up the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag or we made a choice entirely instead of choice not a political one to focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the lunar surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think that we are really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess just gave me

U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect this is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show of you to capture him or the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him\nThere I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat it they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off a cough\nDo you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nAnd the announced last month it would sell the business for an undisclosed amount the deal is expected to give CBS a bigger role in health care by combining the company's managed care through its doors clinics and prescription drug business\nYou're listening to NPR News\nThe midterms are coming listen to CPR news to stay informed about the Colorado ballot this November and insight into other races around the country\nEvery weekend leading up to election day the NPR politics team breaks down major theme is that they're going to be a lot of other investigations there's the races this is a key race in ... and you can\nSort of questions amongst the Democratic risen to the NPR politics show Saturdays at one Sunday evenings at seven on CPR news\n[noise] when you start supporting Colorado Public radio you instantly become a vital part of the CPR membership community\nAnd when you participate during the drive us the chance to win some exciting site is take advantage of Dr only special and health on last extra money for your favorite programs for the first\nTime during the campaign tune in and joined the fund starting Thursday morning Colorado Public radio [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for life's ups and downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com [noise]\nFrom the zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution in one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing account registration and more\nAt zoom dot U. S. and from Americans for the arts\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I now said\nChang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa that\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would of blood or right Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's cleans and one of those fact ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us\nSo we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking a lot about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now they\nAre also you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities\nIt also taps into our pocket books in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters\nEspecially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their turn their campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare fully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to to find the results in the November ... election and that is health care\nAnd President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag\nThirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money and it is but what the president leaves out some important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than that we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill but we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing that doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seemed to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their ... seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto mental like Obamacare an GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and bright when you actually have to debate the the details of the plan\nBut if we're going to have that debate also is probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't really contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he has kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare and they proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees\nThe insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got You're welcome\n[noise] parts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence\nAnd now here comes Michael the storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today with gusts of a hundred fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm has passed\nThe market north apartment complex in Wilmington you haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax for the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents were being told to have to be\nMoving over to where to go to\nMoore and his girlfriend are hauling their furniture out more says ...\nThey're all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can find new housing for them the apartment owners giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\nYeah ... do you and they noticed

I'm stressed out [noise]\nIs the first thing the red cross years has about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe close during the hurricane we actually open back up that\nTuesday for the public after the hurricane um but\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business\nI came in for a few days to help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming small businesses\nAre especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced we can't get them back\nSo it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nSeem of

that we have not take that so that in the event of a twenty to forty miles per hour when that this uh the debris material will stay put and not scattered\nBut let me let me back you up because when we talk to you not quite four weeks ago a with Florence you um had\nAsked people to evacuate you actually were telling us about firefighters out on fire trucks telling people to leave get somewhere safe how about this time are you looking to evacuate or telling people to stay safe stay put\nWorld stand by we have an emergency operations center that we have not activated we have forty one

their home yeah they're finding out that their heat pumps and HVAC systems have been compromised the duct work\nAnd so uh you know sheet rock and and all the components of the home or you know we just uh after careful inspection by our respective department and many as ... as we found that there's a lot more detailed or what has to be done them than what we initially thought\nYou've still got a lot of buildings their houses businesses et cetera with with tarps up for after Hurricane Florence is that right\nWhat we still have seven hundred homes of twenty two thousand\nThat we cannot re power because the electorate components were were compromised during the storm of that we're working as far as we can with the owners to get licensed contractors electrical contractors to come in and correct those problems that we can re power the home\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of of craven county schools that had been shot since Hurricane Florence we're set to

biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John Hi also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rates between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right are there are fears and inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures\nSo you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market\nEconomy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe his cool to bed as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by a sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today of wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this ball market\nIn fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today and that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a third percent so it's been a very tough day for tech\nAnd very tough day but it is just the beginning of along down there trying for the market\nWhile most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the dial down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down was due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy in the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses\nIt's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down but we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually he started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take somebody off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberate should not what you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nYou Lee came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patients to health as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the a B C D E F bundle that\nBundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause to leery of patients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement us as these all reduce the amount of time patients spend delirious\nAnd that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that part is cuts to him and a half so these things are all intersecting\nAs he sits on a ... bed usually explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again they view\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered to ... by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey had been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge Dr Kirk Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into\nWe're talking about a a cultural change so we have to buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by an event you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and the only two rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistance to using the a through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F is the exception\nIt was even a challenge to make it routine\nAt Vanderbilt went to ... and I can't be Joanna starlings or clinical pharmacist at the ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThey need to many cat were need to be here and ... and ... helped me had camping projects really empower the American dream than than makes it everyday\nWest elites crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend in expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen\nSaudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same game on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture show not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumbled could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that descend these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith there at the consulate but\nIt shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ... what my sources\nOf told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis ineffective we said we know what you're up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I\nThe Seattle based company says workers who already earn Fifteen bucks an hour we'll get an extra dollar an hour starting next month Amazon's rival retailers and warehouse operators may also feel pressured to raise pay\nTo find enough workers to stock shelves as the holiday shopping season gets closer\nStocks finished down across the board today the NASDAQ\nLost three hundred Fifteen points this is NPR\nOh and my plan to get from CPR Colorado page paper buying [noise]\nUntil they broke up last year [noise] guitars\nBehaving as it was a tough pill to swallow I mean it was a lot of heartbreak naively disenchantment with his long\nLife in general there have been in the aftermath of Reagan and he knew they use so little relief\nJust wanting to like sort of channel a lot of frustration that us hanging around me as well as my own frustration battling with utility and trying to now combine hard things and turn them into something that we have [noise]\nHave one woman [noise] maybe our NATO\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for life stepson downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers ... come\nFrom a zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and the video conference room solution in one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing account registration and more at zoom dot\nU. S. and from Americans for the arts\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and announced that Chang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he\nMade a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa that\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would of glitter right Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's planes and one of those ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking a lot about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now\nThey are also you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities\nIt also taps into our pocketbooks in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters\nEspecially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their turn their campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare fully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to define the results in the November sixth election and that is health care\nAnd President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag thirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money as it is but what the president leaves out some important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than that we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill but we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing that doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care but he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger\nHas to come at the expense of their ... seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto and uh like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and break when you actually have to debate the the details of the plant\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa it's probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't really contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare\nAnd they proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees the insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley thank you got your welcome [noise]\nParts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence\nAnd now here comes Michael the storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today\nWith gusts of a hundred fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm as NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerged weeks after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington U Haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate moving\nOn a boat out where to go ahead\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling their furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owner is giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\n... and they noticed over the age I Love to go to the movie with a love able to do it at all like your listener a\nMore his girlfriend's terrorists who king sits in a chair and by the front door her head in her hands I'm stressed out [noise]\nIs the faith and the red cross years has about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe closed during a hurricane we actually opened back up that\nTuesday for the public after the hurricane um ...\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly the opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few\nDays to help with the process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get him back\nSo it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nFEMA
